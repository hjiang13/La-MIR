There are 2 functions in the code:
function[1] takes 1 input: string s.
function[1] is encoding the input string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet on s, and outputs a string.
function[2] takes 1 input: string s.
function[2] is decoding the input string that was encoded with the encode_shift function by shifting every character back by 5 in the alphabet on s, and outputs a string.
