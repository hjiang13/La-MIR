There are 3 functions in the code:
function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> game, vector<int> guess. function[1] is calculating the absolute difference between the elements of game and guess, and outputs a vector<int> containing these differences.
function[2] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> a, vector<int> b. function[2] is checking if the two vectors a and b are the same in size and content, and outputs a boolean value indicating if they are the same.
function[3] takes 0 inputs: none. function[3] is running assertions to test the correctness of function[1] and function[2], and outputs nothing.
