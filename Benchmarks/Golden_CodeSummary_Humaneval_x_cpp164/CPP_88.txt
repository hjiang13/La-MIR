There are 1 functions in the code:
function[1] takes 1 inputs: vector<int> array. function[1] is sorting the given vector in ascending order if the sum(array[0], array[array.size()-1]) is odd, or sorting it in descending order if the sum(array[0], array[array.size()-1]) is even, and outputs a vector<int> containing the sorted elements.
