There are 2 functions in the code:
function[1] takes 1 input: string str. function[1] is returning a vector of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string str, and outputs vector<string> out.
function[2] takes 2 inputs: vector<string> a, vector<string> b. function[2] is checking if two vectors of strings are the same on a, b, and outputs a boolean value indicating if they are equal.
