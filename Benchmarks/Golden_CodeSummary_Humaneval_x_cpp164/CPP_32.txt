There are 2 functions in the code:
function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<double> xs, double x. function[1] is evaluating a polynomial with coefficients xs at point x, and outputs a double value representing the result of the polynomial evaluation.
function[2] takes 1 input: vector<double> xs. function[2] is finding a zero point of the polynomial defined by coefficients xs, and outputs a double value representing the zero point of the polynomial.
