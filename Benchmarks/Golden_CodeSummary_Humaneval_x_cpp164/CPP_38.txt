There are 2 functions in the code:
function[1] takes 1 input: string s. function[1] is encoding the input string by cycling groups of three characters on s, and outputs a string.
function[2] takes 1 input: string s. function[2] is decoding the input string that was encoded by function[1] on s, and outputs a string.
