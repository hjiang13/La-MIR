      "Moving on, block `12` is where the code loads some data from the string and initializes variables. It then moves into a loop structure. The loop starts at block `26`, which is a `phi` node, indicating the start of a loop. The loop continues until certain conditions are met, which then branches back to `26` or exits to `43` or `50`.\n",

      "Alright, so I have this IR code for a function called `_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, which seems to be a C++ function that probably calculates the length of a string or something similar. My task is to analyze the control flow graph of this function and represent it as a dot file, showing the nodes and edges without detailing the contents of each basic block.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand what the function does. Looking at the IR code, the function takes a pointer to a `class.std::__cxx11::basic_string` as an argument. The function is decorated with several attributes like `mustprogress`, `nofree`, etc., which probably indicate optimizations or constraints for the compiler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The function body starts by getting the element pointer of the string object. Specifically, it's accessing the second element (index 1) of the string's structure. Then it loads a 64-bit value from that pointer, truncates it to a 32-bit integer, and returns it. So, this function is essentially returning the length of the string stored in that structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to construct the control flow graph, I need to break down the function into basic blocks. A basic block is a sequence of instructions without any control flow changes. In this function, the instructions are straightforward without any branches or loops, so the entire function should be a single basic block.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but sometimes the entry and exit blocks are considered separately. In many CFG representations, the start and end of a function are represented as nodes. So, even if there's only one basic block, we might have an entry node pointing to the main block, which then points to an exit node.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the nodes would be:\n",
      "1. Entry node (start of the function)\n",
      "2. The main basic block containing all the instructions\n",
      "3. Exit node (end of the function)\n",
      "\n",
      "The edges would connect the Entry to the main block, and the main block to the Exit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the function is simple enough, some representations might just have a single node. But to stick with standard CFG practices, including entry and exit nodes makes sense for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the CFG will have three nodes: Entry, the main block (let's call it Block), and Exit. The edges will be Entry -> Block and Block -> Exit.\n",

Instead, those are labels within Block 26. So, perhaps the actual blocks are just the labeled sections, and the rest are part of the same block.\n",

      "\n",
      "Looking at the code, the function starts with some metadata and then defines the function with attributes. The main part is the body of the function. I see several basic blocks, each starting with a label like `%3`, `%12`, `%21`, etc.\n",

Then, there are some comparisons and a `select` instruction that chooses between two conditions. This leads to a branch instruction: `br i1 %11, label %21, label %12`. So, this means if `%11` is true, it branches to `%21`, otherwise to `%12`.\n",

      "First, I'll look at the structure of the IR code. The function is defined as `@_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`, which seems to be a C++ function that likely computes the intersection of two vectors. The function starts with some initial setup, loading elements from the input vectors.\n",

      "I'll identify the basic blocks by their labels in the code. Each label marks the beginning of a new basic block. Let's go through each part of the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Entry Point and Initial Loads:**\n",
      "   The function starts by loading elements from the input vectors into variables. This initial setup is the first basic block, which I'll call `%3` as per the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Comparison and Conditional Branches:**\n",
      "   After loading, there are comparisons and conditional branches. The first comparison is between `%8` and `%9`, leading to a select instruction. Then, there are further comparisons that determine the control flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Basic Block Identifiers:**\n",
      "   Each label in the code represents a new basic block. So, I'll list them out in order:\n",
      "   - `%3` (entry)\n",
      "   - `%20`\n",
      "   - `%22`\n",

      "   - `%44`\n",
      "   - `%50`\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Control Flow Edges:**\n",
      "   Next, I'll determine how these blocks connect. The IR code uses `br` instructions to jump between blocks. For example, after the initial setup, there's a branch to `%22` or `%20` based on a condition. Then, within `%20`, another condition decides whether to go to `%44` or `%32`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Loop Structures:**\n",
      "   There's a loop involving blocks `%32` and `%29`. The loop likely iterates until a certain condition is met, adding nodes and edges accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Exit Point:**\n",
      "   The function exits through block `%50`, which is the return point after executing one of the paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Dot File Construction:**\n",
      "   Now, I'll structure these blocks into a dot file. Each node will be represented as a block with its label. Edges will show the flow between these blocks based on the `br` instructions and conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Verification:**\n",
      "   I'll double-check to ensure all blocks are included and edges accurately represent the control flow. For example, block `%32` has a phi instruction, indicating it's a merge point from `%20` and `%29`.\n",
      "\n",
