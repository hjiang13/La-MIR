Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can construct a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. The nodes will represent the basic blocks, and the edges will represent the control flow between these blocks.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="%2: icmp slt i64 %0, 2"];
    block3 [label="3:"];
    block5 [label="5:"];
    block13 [label="13:"];
    block15 [label="15:"];
    
    // Define edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block15 [label="true"];
    block1 -> block3 [label="false"];
    block3 -> block5 [label="true"];
    block3 -> block15 [label="false"];
    block5 -> block5 [label="loop"];
    block5 -> block13 [label="exit"];
    block13 -> block15;
    block15 -> block15; // To return
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node represents a basic block, identified by a label.
- The edges represent the flow of control between the blocks, with labels indicating conditions for branching.
- The entry point is defined for clarity, and loops are indicated in the edges from block 5 back to itself.

This representation captures the structure of the provided IR code in a simplified form suitable for understanding the control flow.
