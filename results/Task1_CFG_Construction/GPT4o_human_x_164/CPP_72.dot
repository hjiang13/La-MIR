To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow defined by the `br` (branch) instructions.

Hereâ€™s the basic outline of the CFG derived from the IR code:

1. Entry point (function start)
2. Decision point (branch based on condition)
3. Basic blocks representing various points of computation and control flow
4. Exit point (return)

The basic blocks identified in the provided IR code include:

- Entry block
- Block 2 (initial branch)
- Block 12 (after the first branch)
- Block 14 (after the second branch)
- Block 24 (loop continuation)
- Block 28 (final condition check)
- Block 31 (return block)

Below is the representation of the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block2 [label="Block 2"];
    block12 [label="Block 12"];
    block14 [label="Block 14"];
    block24 [label="Block 24"];
    block28 [label="Block 28"];
    block31 [label="Block 31"];
    
    // Define edges
    entry -> block2;
    block2 -> block12 [label="true"];
    block2 -> block14 [label="false"];
    block12 -> block14;
    block14 -> block24;
    block14 -> block31;
    block24 -> block28 [label="continue"];
    block24 -> block14 [label="loop"];
    block28 -> block31;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `entry` node represents the start of the function.
- `block2` is the first decision point after the initial computations.
- `block12` contains the path taken if the condition in `block2` is true.
- `block14` is the continuation after `block12`.
- `block24` represents the loop continuation.
- `block28` checks the loop condition again.
- Finally, `block31` is where the function returns.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT file visualizer or graph drawing tools to see the control flow clearly.
