To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify basic blocks based on the labels in the code and then establish edges between them based on the control flow. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and we will define edges based on the branching and control transfer instructions present in the IR.

Here is the DOT representation of the CFG:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    start [label="Entry"];
    block_2 [label="%2"];
    block_15 [label="%15"];
    block_29 [label="%29"];
    block_31 [label="%31"];
    block_33 [label="%33"];
    block_34 [label="%34"];
    block_35 [label="%35"];
    block_44 [label="%44"];
    block_47 [label="%47"];
    block_49 [label="%49"];
    block_53 [label="%53"];
    block_56 [label="%56"];
    block_60 [label="%60"];
    block_66 [label="%66"];
    block_68 [label="%68"];
    block_70 [label="%70"];
    block_73 [label="%73"];
    end [label="Return"];

    // Edges
    start -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_15;
    block_15 -> block_29;
    block_15 -> block_73;
    block_15 -> block_31;
    block_31 -> block_33;
    block_31 -> block_35;
    block_33 -> block_34;
    block_35 -> block_44;
    block_44 -> block_47;
    block_47 -> block_49;
    block_49 -> block_53;
    block_49 -> block_56;
    block_56 -> block_60;
    block_29 -> block_60;
    block_60 -> block_15;
    block_60 -> block_73;
    block_66 -> block_70;
    block_68 -> block_70;
    block_70 -> end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR, identified by unique labels (e.g., `%2`, `%15`, etc.).
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent the flow of control between these basic blocks, indicating where execution can move based on conditional branches and function calls.

This representation captures the structure of the control flow in the provided IR code without delving into the specific operations within each block.
