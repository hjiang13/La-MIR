Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, here is the control flow graph (CFG) represented in DOT format. Each node corresponds to a basic block with its label indicating the block number or label:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    start [label="Function Entry"];
    b1 [label="%1"];
    b2 [label="%10"];
    b3 [label="%16"];
    b4 [label="%18"];
    b5 [label="%23"];
    b6 [label="%36"];
    b7 [label="%38"];

    start -> b1;
    b1 -> b2;
    b2 -> b3;
    b2 -> b6;
    b3 -> b4;
    b3 -> b6;
    b4 -> b5;
    b4 -> b6;
    b5 -> b5;
    b5 -> b6;
    b5 -> b4;
    b5 -> b7;
    b6 -> b1;
    b6 -> b4;
    b7 -> b4;
    b7 -> b3;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph. The nodes are labeled according to their identifiers in the IR code.
- **Edges**: The directed edges represent the flow of control from one basic block to another based on the branching logic in the IR code.
- The `start` node represents the entry point of the function.

You can use a tool like Graphviz to visualize this DOT representation.
