To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will analyze the flow between basic blocks and represent them as nodes and edges. Here's the structure based on the IR code:

1. **Basic Blocks**:
   - Entry point (label `%2`)
   - Block 4 (`%4`)
   - Block 9 (`%9`)
   - Block 12 (`%12`)

2. **Control Flow**:
   - From the entry point (`%2`), it can branch to either block 12 (`%12`) or block 4 (`%4`).
   - From block 4 (`%4`), it can branch to either block 12 (`%12`) or block 9 (`%9`).
   - From block 9 (`%9`), it will always branch to block 12 (`%12`).
   - Block 12 (`%12`) is the exit point, where the return occurs.

Based on this analysis, the corresponding DOT representation of the control flow graph is as follows:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];

    // Nodes
    entry [label="%2"];
    block4 [label="%4"];
    block9 [label="%9"];
    block12 [label="%12"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block12;
    entry -> block4;
    block4 -> block12;
    block4 -> block9;
    block9 -> block12;
}
```

This DOT format represents the control flow graph, showing the nodes and the edges that define the flow between them. You can visualize this graph using a tool that supports DOT format, such as Graphviz.
