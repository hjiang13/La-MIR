To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow statements present in the IR.

Here's the analysis of the provided IR and the resulting DOT representation of the control flow graph:

### Basic Blocks Identified:
1. Entry block (implicit)
2. Block 1: Initial block before the first branch
3. Block 12: First branch after checking the condition
4. Block 26: Loop block
5. Block 33: Inside the loop after the first comparison
6. Block 35: Inside the loop after the second comparison
7. Block 37: Inside the loop after the third comparison
8. Block 39: Inside the loop after the fourth comparison
9. Block 42: Loop continuation and final condition check
10. Block 50: Exit block (return)

### Control Flow Edges:
- Entry -> Block 1
- Block 1 -> Block 12 (if condition is false)
- Block 1 -> Block 50 (if condition is true)
- Block 12 -> Block 26
- Block 26 -> Block 42 (loop continuation)
- Block 26 -> Block 50 (if condition is true)
- Block 33 -> Block 42 (if condition is true)
- Block 35 -> Block 42 (if condition is true)
- Block 37 -> Block 42 (if condition is true)
- Block 39 -> Block 42 (if condition is true)
- Block 42 -> Block 26 (loop back)
- Block 42 -> Block 50 (exit from loop)

### DOT Representation:
```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Block1 [label="Block 1"];
    Block12 [label="Block 12"];
    Block26 [label="Block 26"];
    Block33 [label="Block 33"];
    Block35 [label="Block 35"];
    Block37 [label="Block 37"];
    Block39 [label="Block 39"];
    Block42 [label="Block 42"];
    Block50 [label="Block 50"];

    // Edges
    Entry -> Block1;
    Block1 -> Block12;
    Block1 -> Block50;
    Block12 -> Block26;
    Block26 -> Block42;
    Block26 -> Block50;
    Block33 -> Block42;
    Block35 -> Block42;
    Block37 -> Block42;
    Block39 -> Block42;
    Block42 -> Block26;
    Block42 -> Block50;
}
```

This DOT representation captures the control flow of the program based on the identified blocks and their connections. You can visualize this graph using tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
