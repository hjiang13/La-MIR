To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we can extract the basic blocks and their connections (edges). Based on your IR code, we can identify the basic blocks and how they branch to each other.

Hereâ€™s the representation in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    
    // Nodes
    entry [label="entry"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block6 [label="%6"];
    block8 [label="%8"];
    block16 [label="%16"];
    block18 [label="%18"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block6;
    block6 -> block8;
    block6 -> block18;
    block8 -> block8; // self-loop for the back edge
    block8 -> block16;
    block16 -> block18;
    block18 -> block18; // self-loop for the exit
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes:** Each basic block is represented as a node. I've labeled them using the block labels from the IR code.
2. **Edges:** The arrows indicate which blocks can transfer control to which other blocks, based on the branch instructions (`br`).

The `entry` node represents the entry point of the function, and the `block18` node is the exit point where the return statement is executed. The self-loop on `%8` indicates that there can be multiple iterations through that block, which is typical in loop constructs.
