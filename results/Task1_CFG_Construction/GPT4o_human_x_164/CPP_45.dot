To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections. The provided code defines a simple function that computes the area of a triangle based on its base and height. 

In this case, the function has a single basic block since there are no control structures like loops or conditionals present. The basic block consists of the operations performed within the function and the return statement. 

Here's the CFG represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define the basic blocks
    node [shape=box];

    // Basic block for the function
    block1 [label="Basic Block: @_Z13triangle_areaff"];

    // Edges (there is only one exit in this case)
    block1 -> exit [label="ret"];
    
    // Exit node
    exit [label="Exit"];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node**: `block1` represents the entire function as a single basic block.
2. **Exit Node**: `exit` represents the end of the function.
3. **Edge**: There is a directed edge from `block1` to `exit`, indicating that control exits the basic block through the return statement.

This is a simple CFG because the function does not contain any branches or loops. If there were more complex control flow (like if statements, loops, etc.), we would represent those additional nodes and edges accordingly.
