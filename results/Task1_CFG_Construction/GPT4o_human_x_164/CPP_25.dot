To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will extract the basic blocks and their connections as defined by the branching and jump instructions in the IR code. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and edges will represent the control flow between these blocks.

Hereâ€™s the DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes
    "Entry" -> "Block_3";
    "Block_3" -> "Block_12";
    "Block_3" -> "Block_51";
    "Block_12" -> "Block_21";
    "Block_12" -> "Block_23";
    "Block_51" -> "Block_60";
    "Block_51" -> "Block_109";
    "Block_21" -> "Block_22";
    "Block_23" -> "Block_32";
    "Block_32" -> "Block_35";
    "Block_37" -> "Block_41";
    "Block_37" -> "Block_44";
    "Block_44" -> "Block_47";
    "Block_44" -> "Block_49";
    "Block_49" -> "Block_120";
    "Block_60" -> "Block_62";
    "Block_60" -> "Block_64";
    "Block_62" -> "Block_100";
    "Block_64" -> "Block_70";
    "Block_64" -> "Block_72";
    "Block_70" -> "Block_71";
    "Block_72" -> "Block_86";
    "Block_86" -> "Block_90";
    "Block_86" -> "Block_93";
    "Block_93" -> "Block_96";
    "Block_93" -> "Block_98";

    "Block_109" -> "Block_51";
    "Block_8" -> "Block_12";
    "Block_35" -> "Block_118";
    "Block_21" -> "Block_118";
    "Block_118" -> "Block_121";
    "Block_120" -> "Return";

    // Entry point
    Entry [shape=rect, label="Entry"];
    Block_3 [label="Block_3"];
    Block_12 [label="Block_12"];
    Block_21 [label="Block_21"];
    Block_22 [label="Block_22"];
    Block_23 [label="Block_23"];
    Block_32 [label="Block_32"];
    Block_35 [label="Block_35"];
    Block_37 [label="Block_37"];
    Block_41 [label="Block_41"];
    Block_44 [label="Block_44"];
    Block_47 [label="Block_47"];
    Block_49 [label="Block_49"];
    Block_51 [label="Block_51"];
    Block_60 [label="Block_60"];
    Block_62 [label="Block_62"];
    Block_64 [label="Block_64"];
    Block_70 [label="Block_70"];
    Block_71 [label="Block_71"];
    Block_72 [label="Block_72"];
    Block_86 [label="Block_86"];
    Block_90 [label="Block_90"];
    Block_93 [label="Block_93"];
    Block_96 [label="Block_96"];
    Block_98 [label="Block_98"];
    Block_100 [label="Block_100"];
    Block_109 [label="Block_109"];
    Block_8 [label="Block_8"];
    Block_118 [label="Block_118"];
    Block_120 [label="Block_120"];
    Return [label="Return", shape=rect];
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is labeled as `Block_X`, where `X` represents a unique identifier for that block.
- The `Entry` node is the starting point of the function.
- The edges indicate the flow of control from one block to another based on branch instructions (e.g., `br`, `invoke`).
- The return point is represented as `Return` to indicate the end of the function.

This representation is a simplified overview of the CFG based on the IR code provided. Each block can be further detailed with its contents if required.
