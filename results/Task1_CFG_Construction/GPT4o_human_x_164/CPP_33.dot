To represent the control flow graph (CFG) from the given intermediate representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow (branch instructions, jumps, etc.). Below is the DOT representation of the CFG for the provided IR code:

```dot

### Explanation of the DOT Graph:
1. **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the IR code. The labels indicate the identifiers for the blocks.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges indicate the flow of control between these blocks, where each branch or jump instruction leads to one or more blocks.
3. **Start Node**: The `start` node indicates the entry point into the function, which leads to the function entry block.
4. **Control Flow**: The arrows depict the flow of execution, showing how the program can transition from one block to another based on conditions or branching statements.

This representation can be visualized using tools that can render DOT files, such as Graphviz.
