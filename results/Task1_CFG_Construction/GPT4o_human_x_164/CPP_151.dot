Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can derive the control flow graph (CFG). In the CFG, each basic block will be represented as a node, and the edges will represent the flow of control between these blocks. The basic blocks are identified by their labels, and we will use these labels as our node titles.

Below is the representation of the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    1 [label="Entry"]
    10 [label="Block 10"]
    13 [label="Block 13"]
    15 [label="Block 15"]
    26 [label="Block 26"]
    30 [label="Block 30"]
    34 [label="Block 34"]

    // Define edges
    1 -> 10
    1 -> 13
    10 -> 15
    13 -> 34
    15 -> 26
    15 -> 30
    15 -> 34
    26 -> 30
    26 -> 34
    30 -> 34
    34 -> 13
    34 -> 15
}
```

### Explanation of the Graph:
- The entry point of the function leads to the decision point in block 10 and block 13.
- From block 10, it can go to block 15.
- Block 13 leads back to block 34.
- Block 15 could branch to either block 26 or block 30, and can also go to block 34.
- Block 26 can lead to block 30 or back to block 34.
- Block 30 ultimately leads back to block 34, which then can loop to blocks 13 and 15 based on the conditions evaluated in prior blocks.

This representation captures the control flows based on the relationships established in the IR code provided.
