To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given intermediate representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their relationships based on the branching statements and flow of control within the function.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph for the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes (basic blocks)
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block3 [label="3"];
    block11 [label="11"];
    block14 [label="14"];
    block23 [label="23"];

    // Edges (control flow)
    entry -> block3;
    block3 -> block14 [label="true"];
    block3 -> block23 [label="false"];
    block11 -> block3;
    block14 -> block14 [label="true"];
    block14 -> block23 [label="false"];
    block23 -> block11;
    block23 -> block3;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the function. The labels correspond to the basic block identifiers from the IR code.
- **Edges**: The directed edges represent the flow of control between the blocks. For instance, from block `3`, there are two branches: one leading to block `14` (when the condition is true) and another leading to block `23` (when the condition is false). Block `11` also leads back to block `3`, creating a loop structure.

You can visualize this DOT representation using tools that can render DOT files, such as Graphviz. This will give you a graphical representation of the control flow graph for the provided IR code.
