To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow constructs (like branches, calls, and returns) present in the IR. The output will specify nodes for each basic block and edges for the control flow between them.

Hereâ€™s a simplified representation of the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=LR;
    
    // Define the nodes (basic blocks)
    node [shape=rect];
    entry [label="entry"];
    bb1 [label="BB1"];
    bb2 [label="BB2"];
    bb3 [label="BB3"];
    bb4 [label="BB4"];
    bb5 [label="BB5"];
    bb6 [label="BB6"];
    bb7 [label="BB7"];
    bb8 [label="BB8"];
    bb9 [label="BB9"];
    bb10 [label="BB10"];
    bb11 [label="BB11"];

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges between nodes represent the control flow, with branching based on conditions and function calls.
- The names of the nodes (BB1, BB2, etc.) are placeholders for the actual basic block identifiers that would be derived from the analysis of the IR code.

This representation doesn't include the internals of each basic block but focuses on the flow of control between them as requested. Adjust the node labels and connections based on the specific structure identified in the IR code.
