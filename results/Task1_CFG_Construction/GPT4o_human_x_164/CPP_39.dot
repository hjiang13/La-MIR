Here is the control flow graph (CFG) represented in DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code:

```dot
digraph ControlFlowGraph {
    node [shape=box];

    // Define nodes
    node2 [label="2"];
    node9 [label="9"];
    node17 [label="17"];
    node19 [label="19"];
    node24 [label="24"];

    // Define edges
    node2 -> node9;
    node2 -> node19;
    node9 -> node17;
    node9 -> node9; // Loop back to itself
    node17 -> node19;
    node19 -> node24;
    node19 -> node2; // Loop back to the start
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node corresponds to a label in the original IR code, representing a basic block.
- The directed edges represent the control flow between these basic blocks.
- The loop structure is indicated by the self-loop on node 9 and the back edge from node 19 to node 2.
