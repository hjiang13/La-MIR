To represent the control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow in the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code.

Hereâ€™s the DOT format representation of the control flow graph, including the titles of each node:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="10"];
    block2 [label="17"];
    block3 [label="20"];
    block4 [label="66"];
    block5 [label="70"];
    block6 [label="74"];
    block7 [label="76"];
    block8 [label="end"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block2 [label="true"];
    block1 -> block3 [label="false"];
    block2 -> block5 [label="true"];
    block2 -> block4 [label="false"];
    block3 -> block3; // Loop back to block 20
    block3 -> block4 [label="true"];
    block3 -> block6 [label="false"];
    block4 -> block6;
    block5 -> block6;
    block6 -> block7;
    block7 -> block6;
    block7 -> block8;
}
```

### Explanation of the CFG:

1. **Nodes**:
   - Each block is represented as a node. The labels correspond to the entry points in the IR code (like `10`, `17`, `20`, `66`, `70`, `74`, `76`, and `end`).

2. **Edges**:
   - Directed edges represent the flow of control from one block to another. For instance, from the entry node to block `10`, and from `10` to `17` or `20`, depending on the condition.

3. **Loops**:
   - For blocks that loop back to themselves (like `20`), there is a self-loop indicated.

4. **Exits**:
   - The `end` node represents the exit point of the function.

This representation provides a clear understanding of the control flow in the given IR code without delving into the specifics of each block's content.
