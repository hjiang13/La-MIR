Here is the control flow graph (CFG) represented in DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block5 [label="%5"];
    block13 [label="%13"];
    block16 [label="%16"];
    block20 [label="%20"];
    block29 [label="%29"];
    block32 [label="%32"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block5 [label="br i1 %4"];
    block5 -> block20 [label="br i1 %12"];
    block5 -> block29 [label="br i1 %4"];
    block20 -> block29 [label="br i1 %27"];
    block20 -> block16 [label="br i1 %15"];
    block16 -> block29 [label="br i1 %19"];
    block13 -> block29 [label="br i1 %15"];
    block29 -> block32 [label="br label %32"];
    block32 -> block1 [label="ret i1 %33"];
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node represents a basic block in the IR code.
- The edges represent the control flow between these basic blocks, showing where the program may branch based on conditions.
- The labels on the edges indicate the condition under which the control flow transitions from one block to another.
- The `entry` node indicates the starting point of the function.
