To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in dot format, we will focus on the basic blocks and their connections (edges). Each basic block will be represented as a node, and we will show how they are connected based on the control flow.

Here's the dot representation of the control flow graph for the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes representing basic blocks
    "Entry" -> "3";
    "3" -> "36";
    "3" -> "170";
    "36" -> "39";
    "39" -> "44";
    "39" -> "147";
    "44" -> "46";
    "46" -> "48";
    "48" -> "50";
    "48" -> "52";
    "50" -> "53";
    "52" -> "53";
    "53" -> "59";
    "59" -> "60";
    "61" -> "63";
    "61" -> "67";
    "67" -> "165";
    "165" -> "169";
    "165" -> "171";
    "170" -> "145";
    "145" -> "147";
    "147" -> "39";
    "151" -> "165";
    "153" -> "160";
    "155" -> "159";
    "159" -> "160";
    "160" -> "164";
    "164" -> "165";
    "2" -> "170";
    "170" -> "145";
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Entry**: This represents the initial entry point of the function.
2. Each node (basic block) is represented by its starting instruction label (like `%3`, `%36`, etc.).
3. The arrows (`->`) represent the flow from one block to another, indicating where the control can go based on branching conditions and function calls.
4. The nodes are connected based on the control flow dictated by the IR code, showing how execution can transition between different blocks.

Please note that this is a simplified representation focusing on the structure of the control flow, omitting the detailed content of each basic block.
