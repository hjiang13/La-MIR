To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections (edges) based on the control flow instructions such as `br`, `icmp`, and `call`. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and edges will be formed based on the branching.

Hereâ€™s a simplified representation in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Nodes (Basic Blocks)
    start [label="Entry"];
    block2 [label="%2"];
    block22 [label="%22"];
    block27 [label="%27"];
    block39 [label="%39"];
    block41 [label="%41"];
    block50 [label="%50"];
    block67 [label="%67"];
    block168 [label="%168"];
    block151 [label="%151"];
    block213 [label="%213"];
    block214 [label="%214"];
    block221 [label="%221"];
    block110 [label="%110"];
    block112 [label="%112"];
    block118 [label="%118"];
    block121 [label="%121"];
    block129 [label="%129"];
    block136 [label="%136"];
    block143 [label="%143"];
    block185 [label="%185"];
    block190 [label="%190"];
    block196 [label="%196"];
    block203 [label="%203"];
    block210 [label="%210"];
    block217 [label="%217"];
    
    // Edges
    start -> block2;
    block2 -> block41;
    block2 -> block50;
    block2 -> block67;
    
    block22 -> block27;
    
    block27 -> block39;
    block27 -> block50;
    
    block39 -> block41;

    block41 -> block168;
    block41 -> block213;

    block50 -> block67;

    block67 -> block22;
    block67 -> block151;

    block168 -> block185;
    
    block185 -> block190;
    block185 -> block214; // Exception handling

    block190 -> block203;

    block203 -> block210;

    block210 -> block213;

    block121 -> block110;
    block121 -> block129;

    block129 -> block136;

    block136 -> block143;

    block118 -> block143;

    block110 -> block112;

    block112 -> block118;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node.
- Arrows (`->`) represent the flow of control between the blocks based on branches and function calls.
- The `start` node represents the entry point of the function.
- Blocks are labeled with their identifiers from the IR code.

You can visualize this graph using a tool that supports DOT format like Graphviz.
