To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format based on the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the basic blocks and their connections. In this case, the provided IR code represents a simple function with straightforward control flow.

### Analyzing the IR Code

1. **Function Definition**: The function `_Z3addii(i32 %0, i32 %1)` is defined.
2. **Basic Block**: The function contains a single basic block:
    - It adds two integers (`%0` and `%1`) and returns the result.

### Control Flow Graph

Since the function only has one basic block and a return statement, the CFG will have one node for the block and a self-loop for the return.

### DOT Format Output

Here's the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Node Definitions
    block_0 [label="Basic Block 0"];
    
    // Edge Definitions
    block_0 -> block_0 [label="ret"];
}
```

### Explanation

- **Node**: `block_0` represents the single basic block in the function. 
- **Edge**: The self-loop indicates that the function can return from this block. 

This is a minimal CFG due to the simplicity of the provided IR code. In more complex scenarios, additional blocks and edges would be added to reflect the control flow accurately.
