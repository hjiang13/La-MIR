To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will extract the basic blocks and their relationships based on the labels and the branching instructions in the IR code.

Here's the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block2 [label="block2"];
    block3 [label="block3"];
    block15 [label="block15"];
    block26 [label="block26"];
    block28 [label="block28"];
    block30 [label="block30"];
    block36 [label="block36"];
    block37 [label="block37"];
    block38 [label="block38"];
    block47 [label="block47"];
    block50 [label="block50"];
    block52 [label="block52"];
    block56 [label="block56"];
    block59 [label="block59"];
    block62 [label="block62"];
    block64 [label="block64"];
    block66 [label="block66"];
    block74 [label="block74"];
    block76 [label="block76"];
    block79 [label="block79"];
    block83 [label="block83"];
    block85 [label="block85"];

    block109 [label="block109"];
    block118 [label="block118"];

    block136 [label="block136"];
    block137 [label="block137"];
    block138 [label="block138"];
    block139 [label="block139"];

    block66 -> block74;
    block74 -> block76;
    block76 -> block79;
    block79 -> block83;
    block83 -> block85;

    block137 -> block138;

    block139 -> block140;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each block is represented as a node in the graph, and the edges represent the flow of control between these blocks.
- Nodes (basic blocks) are labeled with their identifiers.
- The edges indicate which block can branch to which other block based on the flow of the program.
- The `entry` node represents the starting point of the function, and other blocks are connected based on the control flow defined by the branching instructions in the IR code.
