Here is the control flow graph (CFG) represented in DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code. The nodes are labeled according to their corresponding basic block identifiers.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block_3 [label="Block 3"];
    block_8 [label="Block 8"];
    block_12 [label="Block 12"];
    block_1 [label="Block 1"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block_1;
    block_1 -> block_12 [label="if %2"];
    block_1 -> block_3 [label="else"];

    block_3 -> block_12 [label="if %7"];
    block_3 -> block_8 [label="else"];

    block_8 -> block_12;
    block_12 -> block_3;
    block_12 -> block_1;
}
```

In this representation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node.
- The edges indicate the control flow between the blocks based on conditions and branching in the IR code.
- The labels on the edges describe the conditions under which the flow transitions from one block to another.
