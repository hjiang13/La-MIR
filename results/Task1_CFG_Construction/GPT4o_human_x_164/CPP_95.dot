To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to analyze the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow (i.e., branches and jumps).

Here's the extracted control flow graph in DOT format, which includes basic block titles (without their content):

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    bb1 [label="%1"];
    bb2 [label="%9"];
    bb3 [label="%24"];
    bb4 [label="%35"];
    bb5 [label="%38"];
    bb6 [label="%40"];
    bb7 [label="%42"];
    bb8 [label="%43"];
    bb9 [label="%50"];
    bb10 [label="%52"];
    bb11 [label="%59"];
    bb12 [label="%61"];
    bb13 [label="%64"];
    bb14 [label="%70"];
    bb15 [label="%75"];
    bb16 [label="%76"];
    bb17 [label="%77"];
    bb18 [label="%80"];
    bb19 [label="ret"];

    // Edges
    entry -> bb1;
    bb1 -> bb2; // first conditional branch
    bb2 -> bb3; // if false branch
    bb2 -> bb4; // if true branch
    bb3 -> bb4; // fall through
    bb4 -> bb5; // check for condition
    bb5 -> bb6; // switch statement
    bb5 -> bb9; // continue or break logic
    bb4 -> bb5; // continue from bb4
    bb6 -> bb7; // case 1
    bb6 -> bb8; // case 0
    bb7 -> bb8; // fall through
    bb8 -> bb9; // continue to next block
    bb9 -> bb10; // continue based on condition
    bb10 -> bb11; // checks for condition
    bb10 -> bb14; // continues or breaks
    bb11 -> bb12; // check lower bound
    bb12 -> bb13; // check upper bound
    bb13 -> bb14; // increment loop
    bb14 -> bb15; // clean up node
    bb15 -> bb16; // end of node cleanup
    bb16 -> bb17; // continue based on condition
    bb17 -> bb18; // loop increment
    bb18 -> bb19; // return statement
    bb2 -> bb18; // loop back
    bb17 -> bb3; // continue or loop back
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the IR code, labeled with their unique identifiers.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges represent the flow of control between the blocks, showing the paths taken during execution based on conditional branches and jumps.
3. **Entry Node**: The graph starts from the entry point of the function, leading to the first block.
4. **Return Node**: The final node represents the return statement, concluding the function's execution.

This structure allows you to visualize the control flow of the provided IR code in a clear and structured manner.
