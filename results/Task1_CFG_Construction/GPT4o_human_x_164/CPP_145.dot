To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will create nodes for each basic block and edges to represent the control flow between them. Here's how the CFG can be structured based on the IR code you provided:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB; // Top to Bottom layout

    // Nodes representing basic blocks
    node [shape=box];
    start [label="Entry"];
    block_2 [label="%2"];
    block_3 [label="%3"];
    block_14 [label="%14"];
    block_16 [label="%16"];
    block_18 [label="%18"];
    block_26 [label="%26"];
    block_31 [label="%31"];
    block_34 [label="%34"];
    block_37 [label="%37"];
    block_46 [label="%46"];
    block_50 [label="%50"];
    block_53 [label="%53"];
    block_61 [label="%61"];
    block_63 [label="%63"];
    block_97 [label="%97"];
    block_104 [label="%104"];
    block_118 [label="%118"];
    block_124 [label="%124"];
    block_127 [label="%127"];
    block_141 [label="%141"];
    block_143 [label="%143"];
    block_162 [label="%162"];
    block_163 [label="%163"];
    block_169 [label="%169"];
    block_170 [label="%170"];
    block_171 [label="%171"];
    block_180 [label="%180"];
    block_185 [label="%185"];
    block_198 [label="%198"];
    block_206 [label="%206"];
    block_215 [label="%215"];
    block_220 [label="%220"];
    block_221 [label="%221"];
    block_234 [label="%234"];

    // Edges representing control flow
    start -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_3;
    block_3 -> block_14;
    block_14 -> block_16;
    block_14 -> block_37;
    block_16 -> block_18;
    block_18 -> block_26;
    block_18 -> block_31;
    block_26 -> block_31;
    block_31 -> block_34;
    block_31 -> block_18;
    block_34 -> block_221;
    block_37 -> block_46;
    block_46 -> block_50;
    block_50 -> block_53;
    block_53 -> block_61;
    block_61 -> block_63;
    block_63 -> block_97;
    block_63 -> block_63; // Loop
    block_97 -> block_104;
    block_124 -> block_143;
    block_127 -> block_143;
    block_141 -> block_215;
    block_143 -> block_127;
    block_162 -> block_198;
    block_163 -> block_169;
    block_169 -> block_170;
    block_170 -> block_171;
    block_171 -> block_180;
    block_180 -> block_185;
    block_185 -> block_198;
    block_198 -> block_206;
    block_206 -> block_234;
    block_221 -> block_234;
    block_234 -> block_215;
    block_215 -> block_220;
    block_220 -> block_221;
}
```

In this representation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node.
- The edges represent the control flow between the blocks (i.e., where the execution can go from one block to another).
- The labels of the nodes correspond to the identifiers of the basic blocks found in the IR code.
