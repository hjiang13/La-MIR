To represent the control flow graph (CFG) derived from the given intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will create nodes for each basic block and edges for each control flow between them. Hereâ€™s how the CFG would look based on the provided IR:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    start [label="Entry"];
    block2 [label="Block 2"];
    block31 [label="Block 31"];
    block54 [label="Block 54"];
    block63 [label="Block 63"];
    block65 [label="Block 65"];
    block67 [label="Block 67"];
    block70 [label="Block 70"];
    block73 [label="Block 73"];
    block75 [label="Block 75"];
    block76 [label="Block 76"];
    block85 [label="Block 85"];
    block86 [label="Block 86"];
    block90 [label="Block 90"];
    block92 [label="Block 92"];
    block100 [label="Block 100"];
    block102 [label="Block 102"];
    block104 [label="Block 104"];
    block105 [label="Block 105"];
    block114 [label="Block 114"];
    block115 [label="Block 115"];
    block117 [label="Block 117"];
    block123 [label="Block 123"];
    block132 [label="Block 132"];
    block134 [label="Block 134"];
    block136 [label="Block 136"];
    block139 [label="Block 139"];
    block145 [label="Block 145"];
    block155 [label="Block 155"];
    block161 [label="Block 161"];
    block192 [label="Block 192"];
    block186 [label="Block 186"];
    end [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    start -> block2;
    block2 -> block31;
    block2 -> block54;
    block31 -> block54;
    block54 -> block63;
    block54 -> block117;
    block63 -> block65;
    block63 -> block117;
    block65 -> block67;
    block65 -> block70;
    block67 -> block70;
    block70 -> block73;
    block70 -> block76;
    block73 -> block76;
    block75 -> block76;
    block76 -> block85;
    block76 -> block86;
    block85 -> block86;
    block86 -> block90;
    block86 -> block92;
    block90 -> block161;
    block92 -> block100;
    block100 -> block102;
    block100 -> block104;
    block100 -> block105;
    block102 -> block105;
    block104 -> block105;
    block105 -> block114;
    block105 -> block115;
    block114 -> block115;
    block115 -> block117;
    block117 -> block31;
    block117 -> block123;
    block123 -> block132;
    block123 -> block186;
    block132 -> block134;
    block134 -> block136;
    block134 -> block139;
    block136 -> block139;
    block139 -> block145;
    block145 -> block155;
    block145 -> block161;
    block155 -> block161;
    block161 -> block186;
    block186 -> block192;
    block192 -> end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each block in the IR is represented as a node in the DOT file.
- The edges represent control flow paths between blocks based on branching and conditional statements.
- The entry point of the function is labeled as `start`, and the exit point is labeled as `end`.
- Each block is labeled according to its basic block number or identifier as found in the IR.
