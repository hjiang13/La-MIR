To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will create nodes for each basic block and define directed edges between them based on the flow of control indicated by the `br` (branch) and `switch` instructions in the IR.

Here's the DOT representation of the CFG:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];

    // Nodes
    entry [label="entry"];
    block3 [label="%3"];
    block4 [label="%4"];
    block35 [label="%35"];
    block38 [label="%38"];
    block41 [label="%41"];
    block51 [label="%51"];
    block54 [label="%54"];
    block59 [label="%59"];
    block63 [label="%63"];
    block67 [label="%67"];
    block71 [label="%71"];
    block75 [label="%75"];
    block79 [label="%79"];
    block81 [label="%81"];
    block83 [label="%83"];
    block85 [label="%85"];
    block89 [label="%89"];
    block91 [label="%91"];
    block96 [label="%96"];
    block103 [label="%103"];
    block105 [label="%105"];
    block107 [label="%107"];
    block109 [label="%109"];
    block113 [label="%113"];
    block175 [label="%175"];
    block179 [label="%179"];
    block221 [label="%221"];
    block235 [label="%235"];
    block252 [label="%252"];
    block255 [label="%255"];
    block259 [label="%259"];
    block260 [label="%260"];
    block264 [label="%264"];
    block296 [label="%296"];
    block307 [label="%307"];
    block359 [label="%359"];
    block458 [label="%458"];
    block543 [label="%543"];
    block556 [label="%556"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> block3;
    block3 -> block4;
    block3 -> block35;
    block4 -> block41;
    block35 -> block41;
    block35 -> block38;
    block38 -> block179;
    block38 -> block41;
    block41 -> block75;
    block41 -> block54;
    block54 -> block51;
    block51 -> block59;
    block59 -> block63;
    block63 -> block67;
    block67 -> block71;
    block71 -> block75;
    block75 -> block79;
    block75 -> block81;
    block75 -> block83;
    block75 -> block85;
    block85 -> block89;
    block85 -> block91;
    block89 -> block96;
    block91 -> block96;
    block96 -> block109;
    block109 -> block113;
    block113 -> block175;
    block171 -> block221;
    block221 -> block235;
    block235 -> block252;
    block252 -> block255;
    block255 -> block259;
    block259 -> block260;
    block260 -> block264;
    block264 -> block296;
    block296 -> block307;
    block307 -> block359;
    block359 -> block458;
    block458 -> block543;
    block543 -> block556;
    block556 -> block175;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph with a label corresponding to its name in the IR code.
- Arrows (`->`) indicate the flow of control from one block to another based on the `br` and `switch` instructions in the code.
- The `entry` node is the starting point of the function, leading to the first basic block `%3`.
- The basic blocks are interconnected based on the control flow dictated by the branches and conditions in the IR code, which create paths through the function's logic.

You can visualize this graph using any tool that supports the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
