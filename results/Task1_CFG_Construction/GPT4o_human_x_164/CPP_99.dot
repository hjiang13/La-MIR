To generate a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will analyze the function and its control flow. The IR code represents a single function, `closest_integer`, which contains a straightforward flow without any branches or loops. 

In this case, the CFG will consist of:
- A single entry node for the function.
- A single basic block containing the operations.
- An exit node that represents the return from the function.

Here is the dot representation of the control flow graph for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    BasicBlock1 [label="Basic Block"];
    Exit [label="Exit"];

    // Define edges
    Entry -> BasicBlock1;
    BasicBlock1 -> Exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Entry**: This node represents the entry point of the function.
- **Basic Block**: This node represents the sequence of operations within the function. In this case, there is only one basic block since there are no branches.
- **Exit**: This node represents the exit point where the function returns a value.

The edges indicate the flow of control from the entry point to the basic block and then from the basic block to the exit point. 

You can visualize this CFG using any tool that can render dot files, such as Graphviz.
