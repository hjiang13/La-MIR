To construct the control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections (edges) based on the branching and control flow statements present in the code.

In the provided IR, basic blocks are defined by labels, and control flow is governed by instructions like `br`, `icmp`, and `call`. The nodes will be labeled with the block identifiers.

Here's the representation of the control flow graph in DOT format for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Define nodes (basic blocks)
    "Entry" [label="Entry"];
    "101" [label="101"];
    "106" [label="106"];
    "108" [label="108"];
    "114" [label="114"];

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph, labeled with its identifier.
- Directed edges (arrows) represent the flow of control from one block to another, showing the possible paths through the code.
- The "Entry" node represents the start of the function, and the "Exit" node represents the end of the function.
- The specific structure of each node and edge is inferred from the flow control instructions present in the provided IR code.
