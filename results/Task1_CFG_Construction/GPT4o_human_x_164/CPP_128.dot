To construct a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and each control flow (branching) will be represented as an edge between nodes.

Here is the representation of the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block10 [label="10"];
    block15 [label="15"];
    block17 [label="17"];
    block44 [label="44"];
    block51 [label="51"];
    block61 [label="61"];
    block65 [label="65"];
    exit [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block10;
    block10 -> block15 [label="cond"];
    block10 -> block44 [label="else"];
    block15 -> block17;
    block17 -> block17 [label="loop"];
    block17 -> block44 [label="exit loop"];
    block44 -> block51 [label="cond"];
    block44 -> block65 [label="else"];
    block51 -> block61;
    block61 -> block65;
    block65 -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation of the nodes:
- **Entry**: The entry point of the function.
- **block10**: The first basic block labeled `10`.
- **block15**: The basic block labeled `15`.
- **block17**: The basic block labeled `17`, which also contains a loop structure.
- **block44**: The basic block labeled `44`.
- **block51**: The basic block labeled `51`.
- **block61**: The basic block labeled `61`.
- **block65**: The block labeled `65`, which is the exit point of the function.
- **Exit**: The exit point of the function.

### Explanation of the edges:
- The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks, indicating which block can be executed next based on the conditions in the IR code.

You can use this DOT representation with Graphviz or any compatible tool to visualize the control flow graph.
