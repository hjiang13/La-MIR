Below is the representation of the control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code. Each basic block is represented as a node, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes representing basic blocks
    start [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block12 [label="%12"];
    block14 [label="%14"];
    
    // Edges representing control flow
    start -> block1;
    block1 -> block12 [label="true"];
    block1 -> block14 [label="false"];
    block14 -> block12 [label="loop"];
    block12 -> block14 [label="return"];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented with a unique label. The `%1`, `%12`, and `%14` labels correspond to the blocks in the IR code.
- **Edges**: The arrows indicate the flow of control:
  - From the entry point to the first block.
  - From the first block to block `%12` if the condition is true (`%11` evaluates to true).
  - From the first block to block `%14` if the condition is false.
  - From block `%14` back to itself (indicating a loop) if the loop condition is true.
  - From block `%12` back to block `%14` upon returning.

This representation captures the flow of execution without detailing the contents of each block, as requested.
