To create a Control Flow Graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the branching and control flow instructions (like `br`, `invoke`, and `resume`).

Below is an example of how the CFG could look in DOT format, where each basic block is represented as a node and directed edges represent the flow of control between them:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];

    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Block_2 [label="%2"];
    Block_3 [label="%3"];
    Block_15 [label="%15"];
    Block_32 [label="%32"];
    Block_29 [label="%29"];
    Block_105 [label="%105"];
    Block_38 [label="%38"];
    Block_41 [label="%41"];
    Block_45 [label="%45"];
    Block_51 [label="%51"];
    Block_52 [label="%52"];
    Block_55 [label="%55"];
    Block_61 [label="%61"];
    Block_64 [label="%64"];
    Block_70 [label="%70"];
    Block_75 [label="%75"];
    Block_82 [label="%82"];
    Block_84 [label="%84"];
    Block_93 [label="%93"];
    Block_96 [label="%96"];
    Block_105 [label="%105"];
    Block_206 [label="%206"];
    Block_190 [label="%190"];
    Block_203 [label="%203"];
    Block_206 [label="%206"];
    Block_25 [label="%25"];
    Block_12 [label="%12"];
    Block_18 [label="%18"];
    Block_22 [label="%22"];
    Block_24 [label="%24"];
    Block_27 [label="%27"];
    Block_31 [label="%31"];
    Block_17 [label="%17"];
    Block_202 [label="%202"];
    Block_198 [label="%198"];

    // Define edges
    Entry -> Block_2;
    Block_2 -> Block_3;
    Block_2 -> Block_15;
    Block_3 -> Block_32;
    Block_3 -> Block_29;
    Block_15 -> Block_32;
    Block_15 -> Block_105;
    Block_29 -> Block_38;
    Block_38 -> Block_41;
    Block_41 -> Block_45;
    Block_45 -> Block_51;
    Block_45 -> Block_52;
    Block_51 -> Block_55;
    Block_52 -> Block_55;
    Block_55 -> Block_61;
    Block_61 -> Block_64;
    Block_61 -> Block_70;
    Block_64 -> Block_67;
    Block_70 -> Block_84;
    Block_75 -> Block_82;
    Block_84 -> Block_93;
    Block_93 -> Block_96;
    Block_105 -> Block_206;
    Block_206 -> Block_203;
    Block_203 -> Block_206;
    Block_18 -> Block_22;
    Block_12 -> Block_18;
    Block_22 -> Block_24;
    Block_24 -> Block_27;
    Block_27 -> Block_31;
    Block_31 -> Block_31;
    Block_17 -> Block_22;
    Block_202 -> Block_204;
    Block_198 -> Block_202;
    
    // Additional edges can be added based on the flow
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph with a label corresponding to its name in the IR code.
- Directed edges represent control flow from one block to another, based on the branches and method calls in the IR code.
- The entry point of the function is marked as `Entry`, and subsequent blocks are labeled according to their `%` identifiers from the IR code.
  
You can further refine the graph by ensuring all basic blocks are accounted for and that the branches correctly reflect the flow of control as dictated by the IR code.
