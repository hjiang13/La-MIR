To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided IR code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them. Hereâ€™s how the basic blocks can be structured based on the IR code provided:

### Basic Blocks
1. **Entry Block (3)**: The starting point of the function.
2. **Block 12**: The block that executes if the condition from the `br` instruction in the Entry Block is true.
3. **Block 24**: The block that is executed after Block 12 and also serves as the exit point.

### Edges
- From the Entry Block (3) to Block 12 (when condition is true).
- From the Entry Block (3) to Block 24 (when condition is false).
- From Block 12 to Block 24 (after performing calculations).

### DOT Format
The following is the representation of the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    Entry [label="Entry Block (3)"];
    Block12 [label="Block 12"];
    Block24 [label="Block 24"];
    
    // Edges
    Entry -> Block12 [label="true"];
    Entry -> Block24 [label="false"];
    Block12 -> Block24;
}
```

### Explanation
- The `Entry` node corresponds to the first block of code (basic block 3).
- The `Block12` node represents the block that executes when the condition is true.
- The `Block24` node is the final block where the function returns and can be reached from both the Entry block (if the condition is false) and Block 12 after its execution.

This representation captures the control flow of the program without detailing the contents of each block.
