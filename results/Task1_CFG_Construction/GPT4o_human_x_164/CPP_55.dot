Certainly! Below is the representation of the Control Flow Graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];

    // Nodes
    1 [label="%1"];
    7 [label="%7"];
    12 [label="%12"];
    17 [label="%17"];
    19 [label="%19"];
    24 [label="%24"];
    37 [label="%37"];
    41 [label="%41"];

    // Edges
    1 -> 7;
    7 -> 12;
    12 -> 17;
    12 -> 19;
    17 -> 41;
    19 -> 24;
    19 -> 37;
    24 -> 24; // Loop back edge
    24 -> 37;
    24 -> 19; // Loop back edge
    37 -> 41;
    41 -> 19; // Loop back edge
    41 -> 37; // Loop back edge
}
```

This representation captures the essential structure of the control flow in the provided IR code without detailing the internal operations of each basic block. Each block is represented by its label (e.g., `%1`, `%7`, etc.), and the directed edges indicate the flow of control between these blocks.
