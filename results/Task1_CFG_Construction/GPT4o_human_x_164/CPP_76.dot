To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to analyze the control flow based on the branching and labeling in the code. Below is the representation of the CFG based on the IR provided:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    start [label="start"];
    block2 [label="%2"];
    block5 [label="%5"];
    block16 [label="%16"];

    // Edges
    start -> block2;
    block2 -> block5 [label="br i1 %4"];
    block5 -> block16 [label="br i1 %15"];
    block5 -> block5 [label="br i1 %13"];
    block16 -> block5 [label="preds = %5"];
    block16 -> block2 [label="preds = %2"];
}
```

### Explanation of the CFG:

- **Nodes**: Each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code. The `%2`, `%5`, and `%16` represent the labels of the basic blocks.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent the flow of control between the nodes. The labels on the edges indicate the conditions under which the control flow moves from one block to another.

This format provides a clear representation of the control flow graph for the given IR code. You can visualize it using any Graphviz tool that supports DOT format.
