The control flow graph (CFG) can be represented in the DOT format, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code and each edge represents a control flow from one block to another. Below is the DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the provided IR code.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=record];

In this representation:
- Each `nX` corresponds to a block in the IR code.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another, where the specific connections would need to be derived from the actual IR code's branching and control flow statements.
- The labels for the blocks (like "Block 1", "Block 2", etc.) can be modified based on the actual contents and logic of the blocks for more meaningful identification.
