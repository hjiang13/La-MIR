To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we need to extract the basic blocks and their connections based on the branching instructions. Here's how the CFG can be represented:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    start [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="Block 1"];
    block11 [label="Block 11"];
    block15 [label="Block 15"];
    block19 [label="Block 19"];
    block25 [label="Block 25"];
    block27 [label="Block 27"];
    
    // Define edges
    start -> block1;
    block1 -> block11;
    block11 -> block15;
    block11 -> block27;
    block15 -> block19;
    block15 -> block25;
    block19 -> block25;
    block19 -> block15;
    block25 -> block27;
    block25 -> block15;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each labeled node corresponds to a basic block identified in the IR code.
- The edges represent the control flow between the blocks, driven by branch instructions (`br`) that determine which block to execute next based on conditions.
- "Entry" is the starting point of the function.
- The block labels are derived from the block identifiers in the IR code. 

You can visualize this graph using any tool that supports the DOT format (like Graphviz).
