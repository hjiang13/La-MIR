To create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them. Each block will be represented as a node, and the edges will represent the flow of control from one block to another.

Here is the dot format representation of the control flow graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];

    entry [label="entry"];
    block_2 [label="%2"];
    block_3 [label="%3"];
    block_11 [label="%11"];
    block_13 [label="%13"];
    block_15 [label="%15"];
    block_43 [label="%43"];
    block_49 [label="%49"];
    block_53 [label="%53"];
    block_58 [label="%58"];
    block_73 [label="%73"];
    block_87 [label="%87"];
    block_88 [label="%88"];
    block_89 [label="%89"];
    block_90 [label="%90"];
    block_95 [label="%95"];
    block_96 [label="%96"];
    block_26 [label="%26"];
    block_22 [label="%22"];
    block_24 [label="%24"];
    block_27 [label="%27"];
    
    entry -> block_3;
    block_3 -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_11;
    block_11 -> block_13;
    block_13 -> block_15;
    block_15 -> block_15;
    block_15 -> block_43;
    block_15 -> block_49;
    block_43 -> block_53;
    block_49 -> block_58;
    block_53 -> block_58;
    block_58 -> block_73;
    block_73 -> block_88;
    block_73 -> block_89;
    block_89 -> block_95;
    block_95 -> block_96;
    block_96 -> block_88;
    block_53 -> block_90;
    block_90 -> block_89;
    
    block_22 -> block_24;
    block_22 -> block_26;
    block_24 -> block_27;
    block_26 -> block_27;
    block_27 -> block_22;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node in the CFG corresponds to a basic block identified in the IR code.
- The edges indicate the flow of control between the basic blocks based on the branch instructions (`br`), method calls, and the conditions of those branches.
- The labels of the nodes are derived from the block names in the IR (e.g., `%2`, `%3`, etc.) to keep the representation clear and concise.
- The entry node represents the starting point of the function being analyzed.
