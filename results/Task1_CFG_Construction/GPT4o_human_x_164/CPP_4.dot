Certainly! Below is the control flow graph (CFG) represented in the DOT format. Each node corresponds to a basic block in the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, and the edges represent the control flow between those blocks.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block11 [label="%11"];
    block13 [label="%13"];
    block18 [label="%18"];
    block20 [label="%20"];
    block58 [label="%58"];
    block63 [label="%63"];
    block73 [label="%73"];
    block77 [label="%77"];
    block80 [label="%80"];
    block82 [label="%82"];
    block112 [label="%112"];
    block117 [label="%117"];
    block129 [label="%129"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block11;
    block1 -> block13;
    block11 -> block129;
    block13 -> block58;
    block13 -> block18;
    block18 -> block20;
    block20 -> block20;
    block20 -> block58;
    block20 -> block63;
    block58 -> block73;
    block58 -> block63;
    block63 -> block73;
    block63 -> block63;
    block73 -> block129;
    block77 -> block112;
    block77 -> block80;
    block80 -> block82;
    block82 -> block82;
    block82 -> block112;
    block112 -> block117;
    block117 -> block129;
    block117 -> block117;
    block129 -> block129;
}
```

In this graph:
- Each block is represented as a node.
- The `->` operator indicates the flow of control from one block to another.
- The nodes are labeled with their basic block identifiers (e.g., `%1`, `%11`, `%13`, etc.).
