Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will create a control flow graph in DOT format. The nodes will represent the labels of the basic blocks, and the edges will represent the flow between those blocks.

Here's the DOT representation of the control flow graph for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    start [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="1"];
    block10 [label="10"];
    block15 [label="15"];
    block17 [label="17"];
    block19 [label="19"];
    block24 [label="24"];
    block31 [label="31"];
    block33 [label="33"];

    // Define edges
    start -> block1;
    block1 -> block10;
    block10 -> block15;
    block10 -> block19;
    block15 -> block33;
    block17 -> block19;
    block19 -> block24;
    block19 -> block31;
    block24 -> block31;
    block31 -> block1;
    block31 -> block33;
    block33 -> block15;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes** represent the entry point of the function and the basic blocks labeled with their identifiers (1, 10, 15, 17, 19, 24, 31, 33).
- **Edges** indicate the flow of control from one basic block to another, based on the branching and control structures present in the IR code.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT file viewer or online visualization tool to get a clear picture of the control flow.
