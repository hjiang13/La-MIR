Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the control flow graph (CFG) and represent it in the DOT format. The nodes will be labeled according to the labels in the IR code, and edges will be defined based on control flow between these nodes.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    start [label="Entry"]
    node_3 [label="3"]
    node_5 [label="5"]
    node_15 [label="15"]
    node_24 [label="24"]
    end [label="Exit"]

    // Define edges
    start -> node_5 [label="if %2"]
    node_5 -> node_3 [label="if %14 false"]
    node_5 -> node_15 [label="if %14 true"]
    node_15 -> node_24 [label="loop back"]
    node_15 -> node_15 [label="loop"]
    node_24 -> node_5 [label="if %27 false"]
    node_24 -> node_3 [label="if %27 true"]
    node_3 -> end [label="return"]
}
```

### Explanation of Nodes and Edges:
- **Nodes**:
  - `Entry`: The starting point of the function.
  - `3`: Represents the basic block labeled as `3` in the IR code.
  - `5`: Represents the basic block labeled as `5` in the IR code.
  - `15`: Represents the basic block labeled as `15` in the IR code.
  - `24`: Represents the basic block labeled as `24` in the IR code.
  - `Exit`: The exit point of the function (return).

- **Edges**:
  - The edges represent the flow of control based on conditions and loops as derived from the IR code.
  - The labels on the edges indicate the conditions under which the flow transitions from one node to another.

This representation can be used to visualize the control flow of the given IR code in a graph format.
