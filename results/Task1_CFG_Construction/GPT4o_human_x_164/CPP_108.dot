To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify each basic block and the edges connecting them based on the branching and flow control instructions in the IR code.

The key blocks based on the IR are:

1. Entry block (implicit)
2. Block 1: The initial block before the first conditional branch.
3. Block 10: The block executed if the condition in the branch from Block 1 is false.
4. Block 13: The block executed if the condition in the branch from Block 1 is true.
5. Block 15: The block following the conditional check for the loop.
6. Block 21: The block after checking if `i32` is greater than `0`.
7. Block 24: The loop body block for some computations.
8. Block 31: The block for the exit condition of the loop.
9. Block 36: A block where results are aggregated.
10. Block 0: The return block.

Now, here is the corresponding DOT representation of the CFG:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Block1 [label="Block 1"];
    Block10 [label="Block 10"];
    Block13 [label="Block 13"];
    Block15 [label="Block 15"];
    Block21 [label="Block 21"];
    Block24 [label="Block 24"];
    Block31 [label="Block 31"];
    Block36 [label="Block 36"];
    Return [label="Return"];

    // Define edges between nodes
    Entry -> Block1;
    Block1 -> Block10 [label="false"];
    Block1 -> Block13 [label="true"];
    Block10 -> Block15;
    Block13 -> Return;
    Block15 -> Block21;
    Block21 -> Block24 [label="true"];
    Block21 -> Block31 [label="false"];
    Block24 -> Block24; // Loop back to Block 24
    Block24 -> Block31;
    Block31 -> Block36;
    Block36 -> Block13 [label="true"];
    Block36 -> Block15 [label="false"];
}
```

In this representation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node.
- The edges represent control flow between these nodes, where labels indicate the conditions under which the flow occurs. 
- The `Entry` node represents the entry point of the function, while the `Return` node represents the exit. 

You can visualize this graph using any DOT file viewer or graph visualization tool that supports the DOT format.
