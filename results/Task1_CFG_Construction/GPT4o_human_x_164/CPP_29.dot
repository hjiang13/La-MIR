To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will extract the basic blocks and their flow (edges) based on the branching statements (like `br`, `switch`, `invoke`, etc.). Below is the CFG represented in DOT format, showing only the titles of each node (basic block identifiers).

```dot
digraph ControlFlowGraph {
    // Node definitions
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block_3 [label="%3"];
    block_26 [label="%26"];
    block_37 [label="%37"];
    block_39 [label="%39"];
    block_41 [label="%41"];
    block_43 [label="%43"];
    block_45 [label="%45"];
    block_46 [label="%46"];
    block_53 [label="%53"];
    block_55 [label="%55"];
    block_60 [label="%60"];
    block_61 [label="%61"];
    block_65 [label="%65"];
    block_66 [label="%66"];
    block_72 [label="%72"];
    block_80 [label="%80"];
    block_82 [label="%82"];
    block_88 [label="%88"];
    block_90 [label="%90"];
    block_92 [label="%92"];
    block_93 [label="%93"];
    block_101 [label="%101"];
    block_106 [label="%106"];
    block_115 [label="%115"];
    block_117 [label="%117"];
    block_124 [label="%124"];
    block_126 [label="%126"];
    block_135 [label="%135"];
    
    // Edges definition
    entry -> block_3;
    block_3 -> block_26;
    block_26 -> block_37;
    block_37 -> block_39;
    block_39 -> block_41;
    block_41 -> block_46;
    block_46 -> block_53;
    block_53 -> block_55;
    block_53 -> block_60;
    block_60 -> block_61;
    block_61 -> block_65;
    block_60 -> block_64;
    block_65 -> block_66;
    block_66 -> block_72;
    block_66 -> block_101;
    block_101 -> block_106;
    block_106 -> block_117;
    block_117 -> block_115;
    block_115 -> block_124;
    block_124 -> block_126;
    block_126 -> block_135;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR. The labels represent the basic block identifiers (e.g., `%3`, `%26`, etc.).
- **Edges**: Directed edges (arrows) represent the flow of control between the basic blocks based on the branching instructions in the IR. The `entry` node represents the starting point of the function.

This DOT representation can be used with Graphviz tools to visualize the control flow graph.
