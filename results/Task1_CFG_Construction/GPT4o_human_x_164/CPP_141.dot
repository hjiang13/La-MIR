To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will create nodes for each basic block and edges to represent the control flow between these blocks.

Here's the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    start [label="Entry"];
    block3 [label="%3"];
    block4 [label="%4"];
    block5 [label="%5"];
    block6 [label="%6"];
    block7 [label="%7"];
    block8 [label="%8"];
    block15 [label="%15"];
    block9 [label="%9"];
    block10 [label="%10"];
    block11 [label="%11"];
    block12 [label="%12"];
    block13 [label="%13"];
    block14 [label="%14"];
    block21 [label="%21"];
    block20 [label="%20"];
    block28 [label="%28"];
    block56 [label="%56"];
    block43 [label="%43"];
    block46 [label="%46"];
    block49 [label="%49"];
    block51 [label="%51"];
    block52 [label="%52"];
    block140 [label="%140"];
    block136 [label="%136"];
    block123 [label="%123"];
    block130 [label="%130"];
    block59 [label="%59"];
    block62 [label="%62"];
    block64 [label="%64"];
    block92 [label="%92"];
    block98 [label="%98"];
    block102 [label="%102"];
    block108 [label="%108"];

    // Edges
    start -> block3;
    block3 -> block4;
    block4 -> block5;
    block5 -> block6;
    block6 -> block7;
    block7 -> block8;
    block7 -> block15;
    block8 -> block9;
    block15 -> block16;
    block15 -> block20;
    block20 -> block21;
    block20 -> block28;
    block21 -> block21; // self-loop
    block21 -> block8;
    block28 -> block56;
    block56 -> block59;
    block59 -> block62;
    block62 -> block64;
    block64 -> block92;
    block64 -> block98;
    block98 -> block108;
    block92 -> block102;
    block102 -> block123;
    block123 -> block130;
    block130 -> block136;
    block136 -> block140;
    block140 -> block143;
    block143 -> block8; // return to end
    block52 -> block141;
    block141 -> block142;
    block49 -> block51;
    block51 -> block52;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Nodes**: Each basic block in the IR is represented as a node. The labels correspond to the IR block identifiers.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent the flow of control from one block to another based on conditional and unconditional branches.
- The `start` node represents the entry point of the function.
- The control flow graph captures the essential structure of the program without detailing the contents of each block.
