To represent the control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the flow between them will be represented as directed edges.

Hereâ€™s the output in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block_2 [label="block 2"];
    block_20 [label="block 20"];
    block_26 [label="block 26"];
    block_35 [label="block 35"];
    block_36 [label="block 36"];
    block_38 [label="block 38"];
    block_43 [label="block 43"];
    block_47 [label="block 47"];
    block_48 [label="block 48"];
    block_49 [label="block 49"];
    block_58 [label="block 58"];
    block_59 [label="block 59"];
    block_61 [label="block 61"];
    block_67 [label="block 67"];
    block_71 [label="block 71"];
    block_79 [label="block 79"];
    block_81 [label="block 81"];
    block_85 [label="block 85"];
    block_90 [label="block 90"];
    block_98 [label="block 98"];
    block_99 [label="block 99"];
    block_102 [label="block 102"];
    block_107 [label="block 107"];
    block_110 [label="block 110"];
    block_111 [label="block 111"];

    // Define edges
    entry -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_20;
    block_20 -> block_26;
    block_20 -> block_49;
    block_26 -> block_35;
    block_35 -> block_36;
    block_36 -> block_38;
    block_38 -> block_102;
    block_43 -> block_47;
    block_43 -> block_48;
    block_49 -> block_58;
    block_58 -> block_61;
    block_58 -> block_43;
    block_61 -> block_67;
    block_67 -> block_71;
    block_71 -> block_98;
    block_71 -> block_79;
    block_79 -> block_85;
    block_81 -> block_85;
    block_85 -> block_90;
    block_90 -> block_99;
    block_99 -> block_102;
    block_102 -> block_107;
    block_107 -> block_110;
    block_110 -> block_111;
    block_111 -> block_43;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each block is represented as a node with its respective label indicating its basic block identifier.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one basic block to another, based on the branching and flow statements found in the provided IR code.
- The entry point is indicated as "Entry", leading into the first basic block in the CFG.
