To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will extract the different basic blocks and their connections based on the `br` (branch) instructions and the `phi` nodes. Each node in the graph will be represented by its label (i.e., the block's identifier), and the edges will be directed based on the control flow between blocks.

Here's the DOT representation of the CFG for the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block_12 [label="12"];
    block_17 [label="17"];
    block_19 [label="19"];
    block_26 [label="26"];
    block_40 [label="40"];
    block_44 [label="44"];
    block_47 [label="47"];
    block_58 [label="58"];
    block_60 [label="60"];
    block_79 [label="79"];
    block_82 [label="82"];
    block_89 [label="89"];
    block_91 [label="91"];
    block_93 [label="93"];
    block_128 [label="128"];
    block_135 [label="135"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block_12;
    block_12 -> block_17;
    block_12 -> block_19;
    block_17 -> block_93;
    block_19 -> block_26;
    block_26 -> block_19;
    block_26 -> block_40;
    block_40 -> block_128;
    block_40 -> block_44;
    block_44 -> block_47;
    block_44 -> block_91;
    block_47 -> block_58;
    block_58 -> block_60;
    block_60 -> block_60; // Loop
    block_60 -> block_79;
    block_79 -> block_82;
    block_79 -> block_89;
    block_91 -> block_135;
    block_93 -> block_19;
    block_93 -> block_128;
    block_128 -> block_135;
    block_135 -> block_135; // Loop
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The arrows (`->`) represent directed edges that show the flow of control from one block to another.
- The `entry` block serves as the starting point of the function, leading to block `12`.
- The loop structures are indicated with self-references (e.g., block `60` and block `135`).
- This representation does not include the contents of each block, only their identifiers.
