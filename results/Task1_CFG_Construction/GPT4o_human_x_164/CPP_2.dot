Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the control flow and represent it in a DOT format for a control flow graph (CFG). The given IR code defines a single function with a straightforward flow, so the CFG will have a single node for the function entry and a single exit.

Here's the CFG represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph ControlFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    Entry [label="Entry: @_Z15truncate_numberf(float)"];
    Block1 [label="Block: %2 = fptosi float %0 to i32"];
    Block2 [label="Block: %3 = sitofp i32 %2 to float"];
    Block3 [label="Block: %4 = fsub float %0, %3"];
    Exit [label="Exit: ret float %4"];

    // Edges
    Entry -> Block1;
    Block1 -> Block2;
    Block2 -> Block3;
    Block3 -> Exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a block of the function. In this case, we have:
  - `Entry`: The entry point of the function.
  - `Block1`: The first computation where the input float is converted to an integer.
  - `Block2`: The second computation where the integer is converted back to float.
  - `Block3`: The subtraction operation.
  - `Exit`: The return statement.

- **Edges**: These represent the flow of control from one block to the next sequentially.

This representation provides a clear view of how the function executes from entry to exit through its basic blocks.
