To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will extract the basic blocks and the branching structure from the provided IR. 

The basic blocks and their respective labels are identified in the IR code. Hereâ€™s the output in DOT format including only the titles of each node:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block3 [label="%3"];
    block16 [label="%16"];
    block20 [label="%20"];
    block35 [label="%35"];
    block36 [label="%36"];
    block37 [label="%37"];
    block39 [label="%39"];
    block43 [label="%43"];
    block44 [label="%44"];
    block45 [label="%45"];
    block46 [label="%46"];
    block48 [label="%48"];
    block57 [label="%57"];
    block58 [label="%58"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> block3;
    block3 -> block16;
    block16 -> block20;
    block20 -> block35;
    block20 -> block44;
    block35 -> block36;
    block36 -> block37;
    block36 -> block39;
    block39 -> block43;
    block39 -> block58;
    block43 -> block58;
    block44 -> block45;
    block45 -> block46;
    block46 -> block48;
    block37 -> block48;
    block20 -> block57;
    block16 -> block57;
    block48 -> block57;
    block57 -> block58;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph with labels corresponding to their identifiers in the IR code.
- Directed edges represent the control flow between these blocks based on the branching instructions (e.g., `br`, `invoke`).
- The entry point and the exit points of the function are also indicated to provide a complete view of the control flow. 

You can visualize this DOT format using tools like Graphviz to generate the corresponding graph representation.
