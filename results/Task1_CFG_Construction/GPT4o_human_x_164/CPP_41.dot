To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we need to identify basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow.

In the provided IR code, we have a single function `car_race_collision` which contains a straightforward flow: it computes a multiplication and then returns the result. Therefore, the CFG will consist of one entry node (representing the function entry), one basic block for the multiplication and return, and one exit node.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    BB1 [label="Basic Block 1: %2 = mul nsw i32 %0, %0; ret i32 %2"];
    Exit [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    Entry -> BB1;
    BB1 -> Exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Entry**: Represents the entry point of the function.
- **Basic Block 1**: Represents the single basic block within the function where the multiplication and return occur.
- **Exit**: Represents the exit point of the function.

The edges indicate the flow of control from the entry point to the basic block and then to the exit of the function.
