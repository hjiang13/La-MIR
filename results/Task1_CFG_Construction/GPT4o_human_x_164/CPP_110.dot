Here is the representation of the control flow graph in DOT format based on the provided intermediate representation code. Each node represents a basic block, and edges represent control flow between blocks.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block_3 [label="3"];
    block_13 [label="13"];
    block_16 [label="16"];
    block_23 [label="23"];
    block_25 [label="25"];
    block_58 [label="58"];
    block_65 [label="65"];
    block_78 [label="78"];
    block_84 [label="84"];
    block_87 [label="87"];
    block_97 [label="97"];
    block_101 [label="101"];
    block_111 [label="111"];
    block_144 [label="144"];
    block_151 [label="151"];
    block_164 [label="164"];
    block_170 [label="170"];
    block_173 [label="173"];
    block_183 [label="183"];
    block_189 [label="189"];
    block_199 [label="199"];
    block_202 [label="202"];
    block_206 [label="206"];
    
    // Define edges
    entry -> block_3;
    block_3 -> block_13;
    block_13 -> block_16;
    block_16 -> block_23;
    block_16 -> block_25;
    block_25 -> block_58;
    block_58 -> block_65;
    block_58 -> block_84;
    block_58 -> block_87;
    block_65 -> block_78;
    block_78 -> block_87;
    block_84 -> block_173;
    block_87 -> block_97;
    block_97 -> block_101;
    block_101 -> block_109;
    block_101 -> block_111;
    block_111 -> block_144;
    block_144 -> block_151;
    block_144 -> block_164;
    block_164 -> block_170;
    block_170 -> block_183;
    block_173 -> block_183;
    block_189 -> block_183;
    block_199 -> block_206;
    block_202 -> block_206;
    block_206 -> block_164;
}
```

In this representation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node with the format `block_X`, where `X` is the block number.
- The edges represent the control flow from one block to another based on the branching and flow control in the IR code.
- The node labels represent the corresponding basic block identifiers from the IR code.
