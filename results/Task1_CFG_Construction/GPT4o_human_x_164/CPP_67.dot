To construct the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we analyze the branching and control flow statements (like `br`, `switch`, `icmp`, etc.) to determine the relationships between basic blocks. Each basic block will be represented as a node in the graph, and the edges will indicate the flow from one block to another based on the control flow statements.

Here's a representation of the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes

### Explanation
- Each node represents a basic block identified by its label (e.g., "Block 43", "Block 50").
- The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another based on conditional and unconditional jumps.
- The "Entry" node (2) indicates the starting point of the control flow, and from there, it branches to various blocks based on the control flow instructions present in the IR code. 

You can visualize this graph using any DOT file viewer or graph visualization tool that supports the DOT format.
