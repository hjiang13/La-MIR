To generate a control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and the edges between them based on the control flow.

Here's the DOT representation of the control flow graph for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes
    2 [label="entry"];
    3 [label="%3 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 0"];
    4 [label="4:"];
    8 [label="8:"];
    10 [label="10:"];
    14 [label="14:"];
    21 [label="21:"];
    23 [label="23:"];

    // Edges
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4 [label="true"];
    3 -> 21 [label="false"];
    4 -> 5;
    4 -> 8 [label="false"];
    4 -> 10 [label="true"];
    10 -> 21 [label="true"];
    10 -> 14 [label="false"];
    14 -> 14 [label="true"];
    14 -> 21 [label="false"];
    8 -> 23;
    23 -> 10 [label="true"];
    23 -> 23 [label="false"];
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node with a unique identifier (e.g., `2`, `3`, `4`, etc.) and labeled with a brief description.
- The edges between nodes represent control flow and are labeled to indicate conditions (e.g., true/false).
- The entry point is represented with a node labeled as `entry`. The first comparison and branching logic are represented in subsequent nodes.
- The graph is directed (hence `digraph`) and flows from top to bottom (`rankdir=TB`). 

This representation captures the flow of control through the function as specified in the IR code.
