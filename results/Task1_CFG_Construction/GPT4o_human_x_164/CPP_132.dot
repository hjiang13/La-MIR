To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the edges will indicate the flow of control between these blocks.

Hereâ€™s the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    
    node [shape=rectangle];
    
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block_1 [label="%2"];
    block_5 [label="%5"];
    block_16 [label="%16"];
    block_21 [label="%21"];
    block_37 [label="%37"];
    block_39 [label="%39"];
    
    entry -> block_1;
    block_1 -> block_5;
    block_5 -> block_16;
    block_16 -> block_21;
    block_16 -> block_37;
    block_21 -> block_16;
    block_21 -> block_37;
    block_37 -> block_39;
    block_5 -> block_39;
}
```

### Explanation of the Nodes:
- **Entry**: Represents the entry point of the function.
- **%2**: The block where the first operations take place.
- **%5**: The block that handles the case when the comparison results in false.
- **%16**: The block where the loop and conditional logic takes place.
- **%21**: The block that continues the loop logic.
- **%37**: The block for further checks before exiting.
- **%39**: The block where the function returns.

### Edges:
- Arrows (edges) indicate the control flow between the blocks. For instance, control flows from the entry point to block `%2`, then from `%2` to `%5`, and so on.

You can visualize this graph using a tool that supports the DOT language, such as Graphviz.
