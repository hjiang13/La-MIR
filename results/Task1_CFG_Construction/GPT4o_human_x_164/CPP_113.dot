To represent a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we first need to identify the basic blocks and how they connect through the control flow (i.e., branches and jumps). I'll provide a simplified version of the CFG in DOT format, which is suitable for graph visualization tools.

Hereâ€™s the DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];

    // Define nodes representing basic blocks
    start [label="start"];
    block_1 [label="Basic Block 1"];
    block_2 [label="Basic Block 2"];
    block_3 [label="Basic Block 3"];
    block_4 [label="Basic Block 4"];
    block_5 [label="Basic Block 5"];
    block_6 [label="Basic Block 6"];
    block_7 [label="Basic Block 7"];
    block_8 [label="Basic Block 8"];
    block_9 [label="Basic Block 9"];
    block_10 [label="Basic Block 10"];
    block_11 [label="Basic Block 11"];
    block_12 [label="Basic Block 12"];
    block_13 [label="Basic Block 13"];
    block_14 [label="Basic Block 14"];
    end [label="end"];

    // Define edges representing control flow
    start -> block_1;
    block_1 -> block_2;
    block_1 -> block_3;
    block_3 -> block_4;
    block_4 -> block_5;
    block_5 -> block_6;
    block_6 -> block_7;
    block_7 -> block_8;
    block_7 -> block_9;
    block_8 -> block_10;
    block_9 -> block_11;
    block_11 -> block_12;
    block_12 -> block_13;
    block_10 -> block_14;
    block_14 -> end;
    block_13 -> end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node in the graph corresponds to a basic block in the IR code.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another based on conditional branches (like `br` statements).
- "start" and "end" nodes are used to represent the entry and exit points of the function, respectively.
