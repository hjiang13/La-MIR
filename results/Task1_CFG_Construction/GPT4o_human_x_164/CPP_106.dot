To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will define nodes for each unique label in the code and establish edges based on the control flow instructions (like `br`, `invoke`, and `ret`). 

Here is the DOT representation based on the IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block_2 [label="%2"];
    block_8 [label="%8"];
    block_20 [label="%20"];
    block_22 [label="%22"];
    block_24 [label="%24"];
    block_30 [label="%30"];
    block_31 [label="%31"];
    block_32 [label="%32"];
    block_41 [label="%41"];
    block_44 [label="%44"];
    block_46 [label="%46"];
    block_50 [label="%50"];
    block_53 [label="%53"];
    block_56 [label="%56"];
    block_58 [label="%58"];
    block_60 [label="%60"];
    block_62 [label="%62"];
    block_67 [label="%67"];
    block_69 [label="%69"];
    block_70 [label="%70"];
    block_72 [label="%72"];
    block_74 [label="%74"];
    block_80 [label="%80"];
    block_81 [label="%81"];
    block_82 [label="%82"];
    block_91 [label="%91"];
    block_94 [label="%94"];
    block_96 [label="%96"];
    block_100 [label="%100"];
    block_103 [label="%103"];
    block_106 [label="%106"];
    block_108 [label="%108"];
    block_110 [label="%110"];
    block_117 [label="%117"];
    exit [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_8;
    block_8 -> block_20;
    block_20 -> block_22;
    block_20 -> block_24;
    block_22 -> block_110;
    block_24 -> block_30;
    block_24 -> block_32;
    block_30 -> block_31;
    block_30 -> block_62;
    block_32 -> block_41;
    block_41 -> block_44;
    block_44 -> block_46;
    block_46 -> block_50;
    block_50 -> block_53;
    block_53 -> block_56;
    block_56 -> block_58;
    block_58 -> block_110;
    block_62 -> block_64;
    block_60 -> block_64;
    block_64 -> block_67;
    block_64 -> block_69;
    block_70 -> block_72;
    block_70 -> block_74;
    block_72 -> block_110;
    block_74 -> block_80;
    block_74 -> block_82;
    block_80 -> block_81;
    block_80 -> block_82;
    block_82 -> block_91;
    block_91 -> block_94;
    block_94 -> block_96;
    block_96 -> block_100;
    block_100 -> block_103;
    block_103 -> block_106;
    block_106 -> block_108;
    block_108 -> block_110;
    block_110 -> block_117;
    block_117 -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph. The block identifiers (like `%2`, `%8`, etc.) are used as node labels.
- The arrows (`->`) represent the flow of control from one basic block to another, based on branching and control flow statements in the IR code.
- The `entry` node represents the start of the function, and the `exit` node is the termination point after the return statement. 

You can visualize this graph using a graph visualization tool that supports the DOT format (like Graphviz).
