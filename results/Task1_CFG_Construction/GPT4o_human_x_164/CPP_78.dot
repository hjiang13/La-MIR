To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT file format, we'll identify the basic blocks and their relationships based on the control flow from the given IR. Here's how the CFG would look like in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Define Nodes
    entry [label="entry"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block12 [label="%12"];
    block26 [label="%26"];
    block32 [label="%32"];
    block34 [label="%34"];
    block36 [label="%36"];
    block38 [label="%38"];
    block40 [label="%40"];
    block43 [label="%43"];
    block50 [label="%50"];

    // Define Edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block12;
    block12 -> block26;
    block26 -> block32;
    block26 -> block34;
    block26 -> block36;
    block26 -> block38;
    block26 -> block40;
    block32 -> block43;
    block34 -> block43;
    block36 -> block43;
    block38 -> block43;
    block40 -> block43;
    block43 -> block50;
}
```

### Explanation of the Graph:
- **Nodes**:
  - `entry`: The starting point of the function.
  - `%1`: Represents the block following the entry, which contains the initial setup.
  - `%12`: The block that handles the condition check for the first `icmp`.
  - `%26`: The block that handles the main loop and contains multiple comparisons.
  - `%32`, `%34`, `%36`, `%38`, `%40`: Blocks representing the various comparison checks.
  - `%43`: The block that consolidates the results of the comparisons and makes decisions based on them.
  - `%50`: The return block of the function.

- **Edges**: Arrows represent the flow of control from one block to another, showing possible paths of execution. 

This representation gives a clear overview of how the control flow progresses through the various basic blocks in the function.
