Here is the control flow graph (CFG) represented in DOT format. Each node corresponds to a basic block in the provided IR code, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks:

In this representation:
- Each node is labeled with its basic block ID, which corresponds to the blocks in the provided IR code.
- The edges indicate the flow of control between the basic blocks, illustrating how the program execution can transition from one block to another.
