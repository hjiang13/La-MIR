To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the control flow between them will be represented as directed edges.

Here's a simplified representation of the basic blocks based on the provided IR code. Note that actual basic blocks may be determined by more detailed analysis of the IR, including identifying starting and ending points of blocks based on control flow structures like branches, calls, and returns.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes (basic blocks)
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block_1 [label="Block 1"];
    block_2 [label="Block 2"];
    block_3 [label="Block 3"];
    block_4 [label="Block 4"];
    block_5 [label="Block 5"];
    // More blocks can be added as needed

    // Define edges (control flow)
    entry -> block_1;
    block_1 -> block_2;
    block_1 -> block_3;
    block_2 -> block_4;
    block_3 -> block_5;
    block_4 -> block_5;
    block_5 -> block_1; // Example of a loop
    // Additional edges can be added as needed
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each `block_n` represents a basic block in the IR code.
- The `entry` node represents the start of the function.
- The edges represent the control flow from one basic block to another.
- You can add or modify the nodes and edges based on further analysis of the IR code structure, especially if more specific branching and error handling paths are identified.

This template serves as a starting point, and you can expand it with additional nodes and edges as necessary based on the complete control flow of the program.
