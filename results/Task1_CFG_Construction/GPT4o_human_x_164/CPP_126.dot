To create a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will represent each basic block as a node and the control flow between them as directed edges. Below is the DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the IR code provided:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block11 [label="%11"];
    block13 [label="%13"];
    block19 [label="%19"];
    block23 [label="%23"];
    block29 [label="%29"];
    block32 [label="%32"];
    exit [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block11;
    block11 -> block13;
    block13 -> block19;
    block13 -> block29;
    block19 -> block23;
    block19 -> block29;
    block23 -> block32;
    block29 -> block13;
    block29 -> block32;
    block32 -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node with a unique identifier (e.g., `%1`, `%11`, `%13`, etc.).
- Directed edges represent the flow of control from one block to another based on the branching logic in the IR code.
- The entry node represents the start of the function and the exit node represents the end of the function.
