To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will extract the basic blocks and the control flow between them based on the branching instructions (e.g., `br`, `invoke`, and `switch`). The nodes will be labeled according to their respective labels in the IR code.

Here's the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block20 [label="20"];
    block34 [label="34"];
    block43 [label="43"];
    block45 [label="45"];
    block47 [label="47"];
    block49 [label="49"];
    block52 [label="52"];
    block57 [label="57"];
    block59 [label="59"];
    block61 [label="61"];
    block79 [label="79"];
    block81 [label="81"];
    block87 [label="87"];
    block93 [label="93"];
    block104 [label="104"];
    block106 [label="106"];
    block115 [label="115"];
    block124 [label="124"];
    block128 [label="128"];
    block156 [label="156"];
    block159 [label="159"];
    block166 [label="166"];
    block168 [label="168"];
    block173 [label="173"];
    block190 [label="190"];
    block199 [label="199"];
    block200 [label="200"];
    block203 [label="203"];
    block204 [label="204"];
    block207 [label="207"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> block20;
    
    block20 -> block34;
    block20 -> block204;

    block34 -> block20;
    block34 -> block43;
    block34 -> block204;

    block43 -> block45;
    block43 -> block207;

    block45 -> block49;

    block47 -> block49;

    block49 -> block52;
    block49 -> block47;
    block49 -> block45;

    block52 -> block57;

    block57 -> block59;

    block59 -> block61;
    
    block61 -> block79;
    block61 -> block61;

    block79 -> block81;
    block79 -> block156;

    block81 -> block87;

    block87 -> block93;
    
    block93 -> block104;

    block104 -> block106;

    block106 -> block115;

    block115 -> block124;
    block115 -> block128;

    block124 -> block156;

    block128 -> block156;

    block156 -> block159;

    block159 -> block166;
    block159 -> block173;

    block166 -> block168;

    block168 -> block176;

    block173 -> block190;

    block190 -> block199;

    block199 -> block200;

    block200 -> block204;

    block204 -> block207;

    block207 -> block43;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented as a node. The labels correspond to the labels found in the IR code.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges represent the flow of control between the blocks. For example, the `br` and `invoke` instructions determine which blocks can be reached from others.
3. **Entry Node**: Represents the entry point of the function.
4. **Branching**: The connections between nodes reflect the control flow dictated by conditions and branches in the IR code.

You can visualize this DOT graph using a Graphviz tool to see the structure of the control flow graph.
