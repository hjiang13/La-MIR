Here's the control flow graph (CFG) represented in DOT format for the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code. The nodes represent the basic blocks and the edges represent the control flow between them.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes
    node [shape = box];
    entry [label = "Entry"];
    block3 [label = "Block 3"];
    block11 [label = "Block 11"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block3;
    block3 -> block3 [label = "loop"];
    block3 -> block11 [label = "if condition"];
}

```

### Explanation:
- **Entry**: Represents the start of the function.
- **Block 3**: Represents the primary block of the function where most of the computations happen and where the loop is present.
- **Block 11**: Represents the return block where the final value is returned.

- The edges indicate the control flow:
  - From **Entry** to **Block 3** indicates the initial jump into the function.
  - From **Block 3** to **Block 3** indicates that it can loop back to itself based on the condition.
  - From **Block 3** to **Block 11** indicates that if the condition is met, it will exit to the return point. 

This structure is a simplified representation of the actual control flow based on your provided IR code.
