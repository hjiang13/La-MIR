To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given intermediate representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the `br` (branch) instructions and the structure of the IR code.

Here's the CFG represented in DOT format, including nodes and edges without the detailed content of each basic block:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    Start [label="Start"]
    Block1 [label="Block 1"]
    Block8 [label="Block 8"]
    Block13 [label="Block 13"]
    Block16 [label="Block 16"]
    Block19 [label="Block 19"]
    Block25 [label="Block 25"]
    Block31 [label="Block 31"]
    Block35 [label="Block 35"]

    // Edges
    Start -> Block1
    Block1 -> Block8
    Block8 -> Block13
    Block8 -> Block31
    Block13 -> Block16
    Block13 -> Block19
    Block16 -> Block35
    Block19 -> Block25
    Block19 -> Block31
    Block25 -> Block31
    Block35 -> Block19
    Block35 -> Block31
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each block is represented by a node. The labels are simplified to "Block N" for readability.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent the flow of control. For example, if the flow can go from Block 1 to Block 8, there is an edge from Start to Block1 and from Block1 to Block8, and so on.
- The Start node represents the entry point of the function, and each block corresponds to a section of the code that can be entered based on the control flow.
