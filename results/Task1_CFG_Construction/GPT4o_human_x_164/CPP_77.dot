To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: 
   - Entry block (function definition)
   - Block labeled `3`
   - Block labeled `9`
   - Block for `ret` (return)

2. **Identify Control Flow**:
   - The function starts at the entry point and goes to block `3`.
   - Block `3` has two outgoing edges:
     - It loops back to itself (from `3` to `3`).
     - It can branch to block `9` based on the condition.
   - Block `9` has a return statement, which exits the function.

3. **Construct the DOT Representation**:
   - Each basic block will be a node.
   - The edges will represent the flow of control between these blocks.

Here's the DOT representation for the control flow graph based on the analysis:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    Entry [label="Entry"]
    Block3 [label="Block 3"]
    Block9 [label="Block 9"]
    
    // Edges
    Entry -> Block3
    Block3 -> Block3
    Block3 -> Block9
    Block9 -> Ret [label="Return"]
}
```

### Explanation of the DOT File:
- **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented as a node with a label indicating which block it corresponds to.
- **Edges**: The arrows (`->`) indicate the flow of control from one block to another. The `label="Return"` on the edge from `Block9` indicates that this edge represents returning from the function.

You can use this DOT representation to visualize the control flow graph using graph visualization tools such as Graphviz.
