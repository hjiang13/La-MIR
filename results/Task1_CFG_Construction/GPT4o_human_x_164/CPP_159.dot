To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their control flow based on the branching instructions (`br`, `ret`, and `phi`). Here's how the CFG looks in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block_4 [label="%4"];
    block_8 [label="%8"];
    block_15 [label="%15"];
    block_23 [label="%23"];
    exit [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block_4;
    block_4 -> block_8;
    block_4 -> block_15;
    block_8 -> block_23;
    block_15 -> block_23;
    block_23 -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph. The labels correspond to the block identifiers in the IR code.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent the flow of control from one block to another. The edges are drawn based on the branching and return instructions in the IR:
  - The entry point leads to block `%4`.
  - Block `%4` branches to blocks `%8` and `%15`.
  - Both blocks `%8` and `%15` lead to block `%23`.
  - Block `%23` eventually leads to the exit.

This representation provides a clear view of the control flow within the given IR code.
