To generate a control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format from the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will analyze the control flow and identify the basic blocks and their connections.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];

    start [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="%4 = alloca ..."];
    block2 [label="%7 = icmp sgt ..."];
    block3 [label="label %8"];
    block4 [label="label %15"];
    block5 [label="%36: ..."];
    block6 [label="%39: ..."];
    block7 [label="%42: ..."];
    block8 [label="%46: ..."];
    block9 [label="%50: ..."];
    block10 [label="%56: ..."];
    block11 [label="%60: ..."];
    block12 [label="%66: ..."];
    block13 [label="%72: ..."];
    block14 [label="%75: ..."];
    block15 [label="%80: ..."];
    block16 [label="%89: ..."];
    block17 [label="%98: ..."];
    block18 [label="%100: ..."];
    block19 [label="%107: ..."];
    block20 [label="%112: ..."];
    block21 [label="%117: ..."];
    block22 [label="%124: ..."];
    block23 [label="%128: Return"];

    // Edges
    start -> block1;
    block1 -> block2;
    block2 -> block3 [label="True"];
    block2 -> block4 [label="False"];
    block3 -> block5;
    block4 -> block6;
    block5 -> block7;
    block6 -> block7;
    block7 -> block8;
    block8 -> block9;
    block9 -> block10;
    block10 -> block11;
    block11 -> block12;
    block12 -> block13;
    block12 -> block14;
    block13 -> block15;
    block14 -> block15;
    block15 -> block16;
    block16 -> block17;
    block17 -> block18;
    block18 -> block19;
    block19 -> block20;
    block20 -> block21;
    block21 -> block22;
    block22 -> block23;
    block6 -> block21;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node in the graph corresponds to a basic block in the IR code.
- The edges represent the control flow between these basic blocks.
- The `label` attribute on edges indicates the condition under which the flow transitions to the next block (for example, `True` or `False` for conditional branches).
- The `start` node represents the entry point of the function.

You can visualize this DOT representation using graph visualization tools that support DOT format, such as Graphviz.
