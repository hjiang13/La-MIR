Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the control flow graph (CFG) and represent it in the DOT format. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the edges will represent the control flow between these basic blocks.

Here is the representation of the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    start [label="Entry"];
    end [label="Exit"];
    
    // Nodes representing basic blocks
    block_1 [label="Block 1"];
    block_2 [label="Block 2"];
    block_3 [label="Block 3"];
    block_123 [label="Block 123"];
    block_137 [label="Block 137"];
    block_144 [label="Block 144"];
    block_148 [label="Block 148"];
    block_159 [label="Block 159"];
    block_163 [label="Block 163"];
    block_168 [label="Block 168"];
    block_179 [label="Block 179"];
    block_185 [label="Block 185"];
    block_220 [label="Block 220"];
    block_226 [label="Block 226"];
    block_302 [label="Block 302"];
    block_384 [label="Block 384"];
    block_675 [label="Block 675"];

    // Control flow edges
    start -> block_1;
    block_1 -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_3;
    block_2 -> block_123;
    block_123 -> block_137;
    block_137 -> block_144;
    block_144 -> block_148;
    block_148 -> block_159;
    block_159 -> block_163;
    block_163 -> block_168;
    block_168 -> block_179;
    block_179 -> block_185;
    block_179 -> block_220;
    block_185 -> block_226;
    block_226 -> block_302;
    block_220 -> block_384;
    block_384 -> block_675;
    block_302 -> block_675;

    block_675 -> end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block from the IR is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one basic block to another.
- The `start` node represents the entry point of the function, while the `end` node represents the exit point.
- The labels for the nodes are simplified to indicate the basic block's order without detailing their contents. 

This representation allows you to visualize the control flow of the program as described in the IR code.
