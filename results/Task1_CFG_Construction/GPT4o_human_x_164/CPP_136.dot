Certainly! Below is the representation of the Control Flow Graph (CFG) in DOT format, capturing the basic blocks and their connections without detailing the contents of each block.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Node definitions
    2 [label="Entry"];
    11 [label="Block 11"];
    14 [label="Block 14"];
    28 [label="Block 28"];
    35 [label="Block 35"];
    40 [label="Block 40"];
    42 [label="Block 42"];
    47 [label="Block 47"];

    // Edges between the nodes
    2 -> 14;
    2 -> 11;

    11 -> 28;

    14 -> 35;
    14 -> 40;

    28 -> 35;
    28 -> 40;

    35 -> 47;
    40 -> 42;
    
    42 -> 47;

    40 -> 47;
    47 -> 14;
    47 -> 28;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each block is represented as a node in the graph with unique labels indicating their respective purpose or position in the control flow.
- The directed edges show the flow of control from one block to another based on the branching and merging of execution paths in the provided IR code.
