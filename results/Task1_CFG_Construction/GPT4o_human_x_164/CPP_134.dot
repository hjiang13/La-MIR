Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can construct the control flow graph (CFG) as a DOT file format. In this format, each node represents a basic block, and edges indicate the flow of control between blocks.

Hereâ€™s how the control flow graph can be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block1 [label="block 1"];
    block5 [label="block 5"];
    block12 [label="block 12"];
    block14 [label="block 14"];
    block16 [label="block 16"];
    block22 [label="block 22"];
    block25 [label="block 25"];
    block31 [label="block 31"];

    // Define edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block5 [label="if %4"];
    block5 -> block12 [label="if %11"];
    block5 -> block31 [label="else"];
    block12 -> block14 [label="if %13"];
    block12 -> block25 [label="else"];
    block14 -> block31 [label="if %15"];
    block14 -> block25 [label="else"];
    block16 -> block22 [label="if %21"];
    block16 -> block31 [label="else"];
    block25 -> block14 [label="if %30"];
    block25 -> block31 [label="else"];
    block22 -> block31;
    block31 -> block31 [label="return %32"];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each block is represented as a node in the graph, labeled according to its basic block number or name (e.g., block 1, block 5, etc.). The entry point is also included.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges between nodes represent the flow of control based on conditions (if-else) and the structure of the program. Conditional branches are labeled with the condition that determines the flow.
3. **Return**: The return statement points back to the end of the function, indicating the end of the control flow.

This representation provides an overview of how control flows through the various blocks in the function.
