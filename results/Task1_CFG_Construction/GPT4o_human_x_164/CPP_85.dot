To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will create nodes for each basic block and edges for the control flow between them. Here's how the CFG would look based on the IR code you provided:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    start [label="Entry"]
    node1 [label="%1"]
    node11 [label="%11"]
    node16 [label="%16"]
    node20 [label="%20"]
    node67 [label="%67"]
    node71 [label="%71"]
    node75 [label="%75"]
    node77 [label="%77"]

    start -> node1
    node1 -> node11
    node11 -> node16
    node11 -> node75
    node16 -> node20
    node20 -> node20
    node20 -> node67
    node20 -> node71
    node67 -> node75
    node71 -> node75
    node71 -> node77
    node75 -> node77
    node77 -> node75
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the IR code. The labels correspond to the labels in the IR code for easy identification.
  - `start` is the entry point of the function.
  - `%1`, `%11`, `%16`, `%20`, `%67`, `%71`, `%75`, `%77` are the labels for the basic blocks.

- **Edges**: Directed edges indicate the flow of control from one basic block to another:
  - The flow starts from the entry point to the first basic block.
  - The edges represent the branching and joining of control flow based on conditional statements and loops in the IR.

This DOT representation can be used with Graphviz tools to visualize the control flow graph.
