To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will extract the basic blocks and their connections based on the branching instructions and control flow. Below is the DOT representation of the CFG based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes (Basic Blocks)
    node [shape=box];
    start [label="1"];
    block8 [label="8"];
    block92 [label="92"];
    block14 [label="14"];
    block29 [label="29"];
    block30 [label="30"];
    block34 [label="34"];
    block35 [label="35"];
    block46 [label="46"];
    block44 [label="44"];
    block47 [label="47"];
    block60 [label="60"];
    block61 [label="61"];
    block68 [label="68"];
    block72 [label="72"];
    block78 [label="78"];
    block80 [label="80"];
    block83 [label="83"];
    block87 [label="87"];
    block92_final [label="92"];
    block94 [label="94"];
    block99 [label="99"];
    block103 [label="103"];
    block108 [label="108"];
    block113 [label="113"];
    block117 [label="117"];
    block122 [label="122"];
    block127 [label="127"];
    block132 [label="132"];

    // Edges (Control Flow)
    start -> block8;
    block8 -> block92 [label="true"];
    block8 -> block14 [label="false"];
    block14 -> block30;
    block14 -> block29;
    block29 -> block30;
    block30 -> block34;
    block30 -> block35;
    block34 -> block92;
    block35 -> block61;
    block35 -> block60 [label="false"];
    block60 -> block92;
    block61 -> block68;
    block61 -> block72;
    block68 -> block72;
    block72 -> block78;
    block78 -> block80;
    block80 -> block83;
    block83 -> block92;
    block87 -> block92;
    block92 -> block94;
    block94 -> block99 [label="false"];
    block94 -> block92 [label="true"];
    block99 -> block103 [label="true"];
    block99 -> block92 [label="false"];
    block103 -> block108;
    block108 -> block92 [label="false"];
    block108 -> block113;
    block113 -> block117;
    block117 -> block122;
    block122 -> block127;
    block127 -> block132;
    block132 -> block92 [label="true"];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes** represent the basic blocks in the CFG, labeled with the corresponding block numbers.
- **Edges** represent the control flow between the basic blocks, with conditions labeled as "true" or "false" based on the branching instructions in the IR code.
- The starting point is represented as `start`, which leads to the basic block `8`.
- The CFG captures all paths through the code based on conditional branches and function calls. 

This representation is a high-level overview of the control flow without getting into the specifics of the instructions within each block.
