To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their corresponding edges based on control flow statements such as branches (br) and function calls (call). Below is the DOT representation of the CFG extracted from the given IR code.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Block2 [label="Block 2"];
    Block12 [label="Block 12"];
    Block16 [label="Block 16"];
    Block19 [label="Block 19"];
    Block24 [label="Block 24"];
    Block26 [label="Block 26"];

    // Define edges
    Entry -> Block2;
    Block2 -> Block12;
    Block12 -> Block16;
    Block12 -> Block26;
    Block16 -> Block19;
    Block16 -> Block24;
    Block19 -> Block16;
    Block19 -> Block24;
    Block24 -> Block26;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph. The nodes are labeled with a general description (e.g., "Block 12").
- **Edges**: The edges represent the flow of control between the blocks. For example, from `Block 12`, the flow can either go to `Block 16` or `Block 26` based on the condition evaluated in `Block 12`.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT-compatible tool to understand the control flow structure of the given IR code.
