To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given intermediate representation (IR) code in DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the branching instructions. Below is the DOT representation of the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    start [label="Entry"];
    block_1 [label="Block 1"];
    block_11 [label="Block 11"];
    block_13 [label="Block 13"];
    block_17 [label="Block 17"];
    block_25 [label="Block 25"];
    block_27 [label="Block 27"];
    block_32 [label="Block 32"];
    block_38 [label="Block 38"];
    block_40 [label="Block 40"];
    block_47 [label="Block 47"];
    end [label="Exit"];

    // Define edges
    start -> block_1;
    block_1 -> block_11;
    block_1 -> block_47; // Branch to end if condition is met
    block_11 -> block_17;
    block_17 -> block_13;
    block_13 -> block_47; // Exit point
    block_13 -> block_27; // Loop back
    block_17 -> block_27; // Loop back
    block_27 -> block_32; // Loop continuation
    block_27 -> block_25; // Loop condition check
    block_25 -> block_27; // Loop back
    block_27 -> block_38; // Continue to block 38
    block_32 -> block_40; // Continue to block 40
    block_38 -> block_40; // Continue to block 40
    block_40 -> block_47; // Exit point
    block_40 -> block_38; // Loop back to block 38
}
```

### Explanation:
1. Each block is represented as a node in the graph.
2. The edges represent the control flow between the blocks, based on conditional branches and function returns.
3. The entry point of the function is designated as "Entry" and the exit point is designated as "Exit".
4. The labels for nodes correspond to the basic blocks identified in the IR code (e.g., `block_11` corresponds to the label `11:` in the IR).

This representation provides a clear visualization of the control flow within the given IR code.
