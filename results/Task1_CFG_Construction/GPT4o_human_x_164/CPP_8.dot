To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will extract the basic blocks and their relationships based on the control flow described in the IR code. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the edges will represent the flow of control between these blocks.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    start [label="start"];
    block_2 [label="%2"];
    block_11 [label="%11"];
    block_15 [label="%15"];
    block_22 [label="%22"];
    block_24 [label="%24"];
    block_55 [label="%55"];
    block_66 [label="%66"];
    block_77 [label="%77"];
    block_87 [label="%87"];
    block_91 [label="%91"];
    block_105 [label="%105"];

    start -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_11;
    block_11 -> block_15;
    block_15 -> block_22;
    block_15 -> block_55;
    block_22 -> block_24;
    block_24 -> block_24; // loop back
    block_24 -> block_55;
    block_55 -> block_66;
    block_55 -> block_87;
    block_66 -> block_77;
    block_77 -> block_87;
    block_87 -> block_91;
    block_91 -> block_105;
    block_105 -> block_91; // loop back
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node, and the label corresponds to the block's identifier in the IR code.
- The arrows (`->`) indicate the control flow between the nodes, showing which blocks lead to which subsequent blocks.
- The comment `// loop back` indicates where the control flow forms a loop (i.e., a block can jump back to itself).
- The `start` node represents the entry point into the function, leading to the first block of code.
