To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will extract the basic blocks and their connections. For clarity, we will use the basic block labels as node identifiers and represent the edges according to the control flow between them.

Here's the DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];

    entry [label="entry"];
    exit [label="exit"];

    // Basic Blocks
    block_1 [label="Block 1"];
    block_2 [label="Block 2"];
    block_3 [label="Block 3"];
    block_34 [label="Block 34"];
    block_36 [label="Block 36"];
    block_38 [label="Block 38"];
    block_42 [label="Block 42"];
    block_44 [label="Block 44"];
    block_46 [label="Block 46"];
    block_47 [label="Block 47"];
    block_61 [label="Block 61"];
    block_62 [label="Block 62"];
    block_64 [label="Block 64"];
    block_68 [label="Block 68"];
    block_74 [label="Block 74"];
    block_79 [label="Block 79"];
    block_94 [label="Block 94"];
    block_306 [label="Block 306"];
    block_301 [label="Block 301"];
    block_119 [label="Block 119"];
    block_117 [label="Block 117"];
    block_162 [label="Block 162"];
    block_164 [label="Block 164"];
    block_296 [label="Block 296"];
    block_305 [label="Block 305"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block_1;
    block_1 -> block_3;
    block_3 -> block_34;
    block_3 -> block_36;
    block_34 -> block_42;
    block_36 -> block_38;
    block_38 -> block_42;
    block_42 -> block_44;
    block_42 -> block_46;
    block_44 -> block_47;
    block_46 -> block_47;
    block_47 -> block_61;
    block_61 -> block_62;
    block_62 -> block_64;
    block_64 -> block_68;
    block_68 -> block_74;
    block_74 -> block_79;
    block_79 -> block_94;
    block_94 -> block_306;
    block_306 -> block_301;
    block_301 -> block_119;
    block_119 -> block_117;
    block_117 -> block_162;
    block_162 -> block_164;
    block_164 -> block_296;
    block_296 -> block_305;

    block_305 -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges denote the control flow between the blocks, showing which blocks may lead to which other blocks based on the control flow logic.
- The entry and exit nodes represent the beginning and end of the CFG, respectively.

You can use tools like Graphviz to visualize the above DOT format. Just save the content to a `.dot` file and run it through Graphviz to generate the visual representation of the control flow graph.
