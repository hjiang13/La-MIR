To construct a control flow graph (CFG) based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will represent each basic block as a node and the control flow (branches) between them as directed edges.

### Basic Blocks
From the provided IR code, we can identify the following basic blocks:

1. **Entry** (implicit entry point)
2. **1** (the first block after the entry)
3. **12** (from the condition check in block 1)
4. **16** (from block 12)
5. **18** (from block 12)
6. **24** (from block 18)
7. **32** (merge block for both block 24 and block 18)
8. **34** (from block 16)

### Control Flow Edges
Now we need to establish the edges between these nodes based on the branching and flow of control:

- Entry → 1
- 1 → 12 (from the condition)
- 12 → 16 (if false branch)
- 12 → 18 (if true branch)
- 18 → 24 (if condition is true)
- 18 → 32 (if condition is false)
- 24 → 32 (merging back to the common block)
- 16 → 34 (from block 16)
- 34 → 18 (if loop condition is true)
- 34 → 32 (if loop condition is false)

### DOT Format
The final representation of the control flow graph in DOT format will look like this:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    Entry -> 1;
    1 -> 12;
    12 -> 16;
    12 -> 18;
    18 -> 24;
    18 -> 32;
    24 -> 32;
    16 -> 34;
    34 -> 18;
    34 -> 32;
}
```

This representation contains nodes for each identified basic block and directed edges to represent the flow of control between them. You can visualize this CFG using any graph visualization tool that supports the DOT format.
