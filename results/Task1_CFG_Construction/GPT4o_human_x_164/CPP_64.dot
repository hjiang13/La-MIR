Here is the control flow graph represented in DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code. Each basic block is represented as a node, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    entry [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block14 [label="14"];
    block19 [label="19"];
    block24 [label="24"];
    block26 [label="26"];
    block29 [label="29"];
    block30 [label="30"];
    block31 [label="31"];
    block32 [label="32"];
    block33 [label="33"];
    block34 [label="34"];
    block35 [label="35"];
    block36 [label="36"];
    block43 [label="43"];
    block48 [label="48"];
    block50 [label="50"];

    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block14;
    block14 -> block19;
    block19 -> block24;
    block19 -> block26;
    block19 -> block29;
    block19 -> block30;
    block19 -> block31;
    block19 -> block32;
    block19 -> block33;
    block19 -> block34;
    block19 -> block35;
    block24 -> block36;
    block26 -> block36;
    block29 -> block36;
    block30 -> block36;
    block31 -> block36;
    block32 -> block36;
    block33 -> block36;
    block34 -> block36;
    block35 -> block36;
    block36 -> block43;
    block43 -> block48;
    block48 -> block50;
    block50 -> block50;
}
```

In this graph:
- Each node represents a basic block from the IR code.
- The directed edges indicate the flow of control from one block to another based on the branching and looping structures found in the code. 
- "Entry" is an additional node representing the entry point to the function.
