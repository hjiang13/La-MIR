To generate a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow described in the IR code.

Here's the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Nodes (basic blocks)
    start [label="start"];
    block3 [label="3"];
    block10 [label="10"];
    block12 [label="12"];
    block18 [label="18"];
    block28 [label="28"];
    block30 [label="30"];

    // Edges (control flow)
    start -> block3; // Initial branch to block 3
    block3 -> block10; // From block 3 to block 10
    block3 -> block12; // From block 3 to block 12
    block10 -> block30; // From block 10 to block 30
    block12 -> block18; // From block 12 to block 18
    block12 -> block28; // From block 12 to block 28
    block18 -> block28; // From block 18 to block 28 (loop)
    block18 -> block12; // From block 18 back to block 12 (loop)
    block30 -> block12; // From block 30 back to block 12 (loop)
    block30 -> block10; // From block 30 to block 10
    block28 -> block30; // From block 28 to block 30
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block has been labeled with its identifier (like `3`, `10`, `12`, `18`, `28`, `30`).
- The arrows indicate the flow of control between the blocks. 
- The `start` node represents the entry point of the function and branches to block `3`. 
- The edges depict the flow of execution based on the control flow defined by the `br` (branch) instructions in the IR code.

You can utilize this DOT representation to visualize the CFG using graph visualization tools like Graphviz.
