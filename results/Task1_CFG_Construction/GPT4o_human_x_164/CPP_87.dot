To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided IR code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow instructions (like `br`, `ret`, `invoke`, etc.) in the code. 

Here's a simplified version of the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define the nodes
    node [shape=box];
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Block_3 [label="Block 3"];
    Block_13 [label="Block 13"];
    Block_36 [label="Block 36"];
    Block_31 [label="Block 31"];
    Block_48 [label="Block 48"];
    Block_58 [label="Block 58"];
    Block_60 [label="Block 60"];
    Block_62 [label="Block 62"];
    Block_75 [label="Block 75"];
    Block_81 [label="Block 81"];
    Block_12 [label="Block 12"];
    Block_14 [label="Block 14"];
    Block_17 [label="Block 17"];
    Block_19 [label="Block 19"];
    Block_24 [label="Block 24"];
    Block_141 [label="Block 141"];
    Block_131 [label="Block 131"];
    
    // Define the edges
    Entry -> Block_3;
    Block_3 -> Block_13;
    Block_3 -> Block_36;
    Block_13 -> Block_31;
    Block_13 -> Block_36;
    Block_36 -> Block_31;
    Block_36 -> Block_141;
    Block_31 -> Block_48;
    Block_48 -> Block_58;
    Block_58 -> Block_62;
    Block_62 -> Block_75;
    Block_75 -> Block_81;
    Block_75 -> Block_68;
    Block_62 -> Block_131;
    Block_60 -> Block_129;
    Block_141 -> Block_131;
    Block_131 -> Block_137;
    Block_137 -> Block_48;
    Block_12 -> Block_14;
    Block_14 -> Block_17;
    Block_17 -> Block_19;
    Block_19 -> Block_24;
    Block_24 -> Block_14;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each block is represented as a node. The labels indicate the block numbers from the IR code.
- **Edges**: The directed edges (`->`) represent the flow of control from one block to another based on branching and control flow instructions.

This representation can be visualized using tools that support DOT format to get a graphical representation of the control flow graph.
