To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their relationships (edges) based on the branching instructions and the structure of the IR.

Here's the DOT representation of the control flow graph derived from the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block3 [label="%3"];
    block20 [label="%20"];
    block22 [label="%22"];
    block29 [label="%29"];
    block32 [label="%32"];
    block37 [label="%37"];
    block44 [label="%44"];
    block50 [label="%50"];

    // Define edges
    entry -> block3;
    block3 -> block20;
    block3 -> block22;
    block20 -> block32;
    block20 -> block44;
    block22 -> block50;
    block29 -> block32;
    block29 -> block44;
    block32 -> block29;
    block32 -> block37;
    block37 -> block50;
    block44 -> block50;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the IR code. The labels correspond to the block identifiers (e.g., `%3`, `%20`, etc.).
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent the flow of control from one block to another, based on the branching and control instructions in the IR code. 
- **Entry**: The flow starts from an entry node which transitions to the first block.

This representation provides a clear view of the control flow within the function defined in the IR code. You can visualize this graph using any DOT viewer or graph visualization tool.
