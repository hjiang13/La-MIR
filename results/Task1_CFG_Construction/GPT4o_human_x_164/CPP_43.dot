Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the control flow and create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the transitions (branches) between them will be represented as edges.

Hereâ€™s the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Define nodes
    node1 [label="Entry"];
    node2 [label="BB1"];
    node3 [label="BB2"];
    node4 [label="BB3"];
    node5 [label="BB4"];
    node6 [label="BB5"];
    node7 [label="BB6"];
    node8 [label="BB7"];
    node9 [label="BB8"];
    node10 [label="Return"];

    // Define edges
    node1 -> node2;   // Entry to BB1
    node2 -> node3;   // BB1 to BB2
    node3 -> node4;   // BB2 to BB3 (true branch)
    node3 -> node5;   // BB2 to BB6 (false branch)
    node4 -> node6;   // BB3 to BB4
    node5 -> node7;   // BB5 to BB6 (loop back)
    node6 -> node8;   // BB4 to BB7
    node7 -> node4;   // BB6 back to BB3 (loop)
    node8 -> node9;   // BB7 to BB8
    node9 -> node10;  // BB8 to Return
    node7 -> node5;   // BB6 to BB5 (loop condition)
    node5 -> node3;   // BB5 to BB2 (condition check)
    node9 -> node10;  // BB8 to Return
}
```

### Explanation of the Nodes:
- **Entry**: The starting point of the function.
- **BB1**: The first basic block after entry, contains initial operations.
- **BB2**: The block that checks the condition for branching.
- **BB3**: The block executed if the condition is true (i.e., when the value is equal to zero).
- **BB4**: The block executed after incrementing the loop counter.
- **BB5**: The block executed if the loop condition is false.
- **BB6**: The block for further operations inside the loop.
- **BB7**: The block for loading values and performing computations.
- **BB8**: The block where the result is checked.
- **Return**: The return block where the function returns a result.

### Note:
- The descriptions of each basic block are not included in the graph to keep it concise, as per your request.
