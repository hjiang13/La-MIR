To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and the control flow edges between them based on the branching and control flow instructions present in the code.

### Control Flow Graph in DOT Format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    entry [label="entry"]
    block_2 [label="block_2"]
    block_20 [label="block_20"]
    block_29 [label="block_29"]
    block_36 [label="block_36"]
    block_39 [label="block_39"]
    block_46 [label="block_46"]
    block_48 [label="block_48"]
    block_52 [label="block_52"]
    block_54 [label="block_54"]
    block_57 [label="block_57"]
    block_59 [label="block_59"]
    block_64 [label="block_64"]
    block_65 [label="block_65"]
    block_68 [label="block_68"]
    block_72 [label="block_72"]
    block_78 [label="block_78"]
    block_82 [label="block_82"]
    block_85 [label="block_85"]
    block_87 [label="block_87"]
    block_88 [label="block_88"]
    block_98 [label="block_98"]

    entry -> block_2
    block_2 -> block_20
    block_20 -> block_29
    block_29 -> block_36
    block_29 -> block_88
    block_29 -> block_39
    block_36 -> block_39
    block_39 -> block_46
    block_39 -> block_57
    block_46 -> block_48
    block_48 -> block_52
    block_52 -> block_54
    block_54 -> block_78
    block_57 -> block_59
    block_59 -> block_64
    block_59 -> block_78
    block_65 -> block_72
    block_72 -> block_78
    block_78 -> block_88
    block_82 -> block_85
    block_85 -> block_87
    block_87 -> block_88
    block_88 -> block_20
    block_88 -> block_98
    block_98 -> end
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node in the graph represents a basic block in the IR code.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one basic block to another based on branching (e.g., `br`, `icmp`, `invoke`, etc.).
- The labels of the nodes correspond to either the entry point or the basic block identifiers as they appear in the IR code.
- The "entry" node is the starting point of the function, and the "end" node represents the return point of the function.

This representation captures the essential structure of the control flow graph without delving into the specifics of the instructions within each basic block.
