Here is the control flow graph (CFG) represented in DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes
    A [label="%1"];
    B [label="%10"];
    C [label="%13"];
    D [label="%15"];
    E [label="%21"];
    F [label="%25"];
    G [label="%30"];
    H [label="%33"];

    // Edges
    A -> B [label="br i1 %9"];
    A -> C [label="br i1 %9"];
    
    B -> D [label="br label %15"];
    
    C -> H [label="ret i32 %14"];

    D -> E [label="br i1 %20"];
    D -> F [label="br i1 %20"];
    
    E -> H [label="br label %33"];
    
    F -> G [label="br i1 %27"];
    F -> H [label="br label %33"];
    
    G -> H [label="br label %33"];
    
    H -> C [label="br i1 %37"];
    H -> D [label="br i1 %37"];
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code, represented by labels such as `%1`, `%10`, `%13`, etc.
- Directed edges between nodes represent the flow of control from one basic block to another, based on the branching instructions (e.g., `br i1`).
- The nodes are labeled with their corresponding block identifiers, and the edges show possible transitions based on the control flow. 

This representation captures the structure of the function `sum_squares` as described in the input IR code.
