To construct the control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the given intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to identify the basic blocks and the flow of control between them. 

Here's the analysis of the provided IR code:

1. **Basic Blocks**:
    - **Entry Block**: The function starts executing from the entry block.
    - **Block 12**: This block is executed if the condition in the branch instruction is false.
    - **Block 21**: This block is the common exit block for the function, where the return value is determined.

2. **Control Flow**:
    - The function starts at the entry block.
    - The flow goes to Block 12 if the condition in the branch from Block 3 is true.
    - Both Block 12 and Block 3 can lead to Block 21.
    - Block 21 contains the return statement.

Based on this analysis, here is the corresponding DOT representation for the CFG:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    Entry -> Block12;
    Block3 -> Block12;
    Block12 -> Block21;
    Block3 -> Block21;
    Block12 -> Block21;
}
```

### Explanation of the DOT Representation:
- **Nodes**:
    - `Entry` represents the entry point of the function.
    - `Block12` represents the block labeled `12` in the IR code.
    - `Block3` represents the predecessor block from which the branch leading to Block 12 originates.
    - `Block21` represents the final block where the return occurs.

- **Edges**:
    - Directed edges indicate the flow from one block to another based on the branching logic in the IR code.

This representation provides a simplified view of the control flow within the function defined by the IR code.
