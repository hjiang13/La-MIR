To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given IR code in DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and the flow of control between them. Based on the provided IR code, hereâ€™s the CFG:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=rectangle];

    entry [label="Entry"];
    block_1 [label="%4: icmp eq i64 %3, 0"];
    block_5 [label="5: block"];
    block_8 [label="8: block"];
    block_10 [label="10: block"];
    block_23 [label="23: block"];
    block_25 [label="25: block"];

    // Define the edges between the nodes
    entry -> block_1;
    block_1 -> block_5 [label="true"];
    block_1 -> block_10 [label="false"];
    block_5 -> block_10;
    block_10 -> block_8 [label="continue"];
    block_8 -> block_10 [label="loop"];
    block_8 -> block_23 [label="break"];
    block_23 -> block_25;
    block_10 -> block_25 [label="exit"];
    block_25 -> block_5 [label="return"];
}
```

### Explanation of the Nodes and Edges:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block of the IR code. The labels indicate the basic block and the operations or conditions they contain.
- **Edges**: The directed edges represent the flow of control between basic blocks. Labels on the edges give information about the conditions or control flow mechanisms (like "true", "false", "continue", "break", etc.).

This representation allows you to visualize the flow of control within the function defined in the IR code. You can use graph visualization tools to render this DOT representation into a graphical format.
