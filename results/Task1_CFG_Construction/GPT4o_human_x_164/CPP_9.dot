To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will create nodes for each basic block and edges for the control flow between them. The nodes will be labeled with the block identifiers, and we will establish edges based on the branching and control flow instructions.

Hereâ€™s the DOT representation of the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block2 [label="%2"];
    block3 [label="%3"];
    block12 [label="%12"];
    block13 [label="%13"];
    block26 [label="%26"];
    block28 [label="%28"];
    block34 [label="%34"];
    block35 [label="%35"];
    block36 [label="%36"];
    block45 [label="%45"];
    block48 [label="%48"];
    block50 [label="%50"];
    block54 [label="%54"];
    block57 [label="%57"];
    block60 [label="%60"];
    block62 [label="%62"];
    block66 [label="%66"];
    block78 [label="%78"];
    block80 [label="%80"];
    block82 [label="%82"];
    block85 [label="%85"];
    block87 [label="%87"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block3;
    block3 -> block12 [label="true"];
    block3 -> block13 [label="false"];
    block12 -> block2;
    block13 -> block26;
    block26 -> block66;
    block13 -> block28;
    block28 -> block34 [label="true"];
    block28 -> block36 [label="false"];
    block34 -> block35;
    block36 -> block45;
    block45 -> block48;
    block48 -> block50;
    block50 -> block54 [label="true"];
    block50 -> block57 [label="false"];
    block54 -> block57;
    block57 -> block60 [label="false"];
    block57 -> block62 [label="true"];
    block60 -> block62;
    block62 -> block66;
    block66 -> block12;
    block66 -> block13;
    block66 -> block26;
    block66 -> block78 [label="unwind"];
    block78 -> block82;
    block80 -> block82;
    block82 -> block85 [label="false"];
    block82 -> block87 [label="true"];
    block85 -> block87;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges between the nodes indicate the control flow, where a decision point (like a `br` instruction) leads to different blocks based on the condition.
- The labels on the edges help clarify the conditions that lead to transitions between blocks.
- The entry point and unwind edges are also included to represent the flow of execution properly.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT-compatible visualization tool or library.
