To represent the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them. Here's how the basic blocks can be identified from the IR code and how we can represent them in DOT format:

### Basic Blocks Identified:
1. **Entry Block (1)** - The entry point of the function.
2. **Block 10** - After the first conditional branch.
3. **Block 16** - After the first conditional in Block 10.
4. **Block 18** - After the loop's condition check.
5. **Block 23** - Inside the loop, where the main processing happens.
6. **Block 34** - The exit block for returning from the function.
7. **Block 36** - The alternative loop exit block.

### Control Flow Edges:
- Entry block (1) → Block 10 (due to the first branch)
- Block 10 → Block 16 (true branch)
- Block 10 → Block 18 (false branch)
- Block 16 → Block 36 (direct flow)
- Block 18 → Block 23 (continuation of the loop)
- Block 23 → Block 34 (exit condition)
- Block 23 → Block 18 (loop back)
- Block 34 → Exit (return with value)
- Block 36 → Block 18 (loop back)

### DOT Representation:
Here is the DOT file representation of the CFG:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    1 [label="Entry Block"];
    10 [label="Block 10"];
    16 [label="Block 16"];
    18 [label="Block 18"];
    23 [label="Block 23"];
    34 [label="Block 34"];
    36 [label="Block 36"];

    // Edges
    1 -> 10;
    10 -> 16;
    10 -> 18;
    16 -> 36;
    18 -> 23;
    23 -> 34;
    23 -> 18;
    34 -> 1;  // assuming return to function caller
    36 -> 18; // loop back from 36 to 18
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node represents a basic block of the IR code.
- The directed edges represent the control flow from one block to another based on the branching and looping conditions found in the IR code. 

This representation can be visualized using a graphing tool that supports DOT files, which will illustrate the flow of control through the function clearly.
