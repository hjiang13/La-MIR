Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I'll extract the control flow graph (CFG) and represent it in DOT format. Each label in the nodes will correspond to the basic block identifiers in the IR code.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    3 [label="Entry"];
    4 [label="Block 4"];
    17 [label="Block 17"];
    22 [label="Block 22"];
    24 [label="Block 24"];
    26 [label="Block 26"];
    27 [label="Block 27"];
    31 [label="Block 31"];
    35 [label="Block 35"];
    41 [label="Block 41"];
    42 [label="Block 42"];
    45 [label="Block 45"];
    51 [label="Block 51"];
    54 [label="Block 54"];
    57 [label="Block 57"];
    59 [label="Block 59"];
    60 [label="Block 60"];
    65 [label="Block 65"];
    72 [label="Block 72"];
    73 [label="Block 73"];
    74 [label="Block 74"];
    79 [label="Block 79"];
    82 [label="Block 82"];
    83 [label="Block 83"];
    85 [label="Block 85"];
    87 [label="Block 87"];
    91 [label="Block 91"];
    92 [label="Block 92"];
    96 [label="Block 96"];
    97 [label="Block 97"];
    98 [label="Block 98"];
    
    // Edges
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 17;
    17 -> 22;
    22 -> 24;
    22 -> 26;
    24 -> 27;
    26 -> 27;
    27 -> 31;
    31 -> 35;
    35 -> 41;
    35 -> 42;
    41 -> 45;
    42 -> 45;
    45 -> 51;
    51 -> 54;
    54 -> 57;
    54 -> 59;
    57 -> 60;
    59 -> 60;
    60 -> 65;
    65 -> 72;
    65 -> 73;
    72 -> 74;
    73 -> 74;
    74 -> 79;
    74 -> 82;
    79 -> 83;
    82 -> 83;
    83 -> 85;
    85 -> 91;
    87 -> 91;
    87 -> 92;
    91 -> 92;
    92 -> 96;
    92 -> 97;
    96 -> 98;
    97 -> 98;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node corresponds to a basic block in the original IR code.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another, according to the branch instructions (like `br`, `invoke`, etc.) and the structure of the code.
- The labels for the nodes are simplified to represent the block identifiers without detailing the contents of each block.
