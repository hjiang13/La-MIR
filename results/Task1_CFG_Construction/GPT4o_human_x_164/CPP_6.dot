To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow instructions (such as branches, switches, invokes, etc.). Each basic block will be represented as a node, and edges will represent the flow between these blocks.

Here is a possible DOT representation of the CFG for your provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

In this representation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node with a unique label.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one basic block to another.
- The actual labels of the nodes are derived from the IR code, and the structure of the CFG is extracted based on control flow instructions such as branches and invokes.
- You may need to adjust node labels and connections based on your specific understanding of the IR code structure and flow.

This is a simplified view; the actual construction of the CFG might require more detailed parsing of the IR depending on the exact semantics of your program.
