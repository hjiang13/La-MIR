To construct a Control Flow Graph (CFG) from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the basic blocks in the function and how they are connected. However, the IR code provided has only one function with a single basic block, so the CFG will be quite simple.

The basic structure of the dot file will include a single node for the basic block and a "ret" statement indicating the exit of the function. Hereâ€™s how to represent it in the dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define the basic block
    block0 [label="Basic Block 0"];

    // Define the return node
    ret_node [label="Return"];

    // Define the edges
    block0 -> ret_node;
}
```

This representation indicates that there is one basic block (`block0`), and it has a connection to the return node, representing the end of the function execution. 

If there were more basic blocks or control flow statements (like conditionals or loops), we would add those as additional nodes and edges accordingly. But for the provided IR code, this is the complete CFG representation.
