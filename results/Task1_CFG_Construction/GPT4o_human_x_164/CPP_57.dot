To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the edges will indicate the flow of control from one block to another.

Let's analyze the provided IR code to extract the relevant information for creating the CFG:

1. **Basic Blocks:**
   - Entry Point: `%1`
   - Block 11: `%11`
   - Block 17: `%17`
   - Block 19: `%19`
   - Block 27: `%27`
   - Block 42: `%42`
   - Block 47: `%47`

2. **Control Flow:**
   - From `%1` to `%11`
   - From `%11` to `%17` (if condition is false)
   - From `%11` to `%19` (if condition is true)
   - From `%17` to `%47`
   - From `%19` to `%27` (if condition is true)
   - From `%19` to `%42` (if condition is false)
   - From `%27` to `%27` (loop back)
   - From `%27` to `%42`
   - From `%47` to `%19` (loop back)
   - From `%47` to `%42`

In DOT format, the CFG can be represented as follows:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry Point"];
    block11 [label="%11"];
    block17 [label="%17"];
    block19 [label="%19"];
    block27 [label="%27"];
    block42 [label="%42"];
    block47 [label="%47"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block11;
    block11 -> block17 [label="false"];
    block11 -> block19 [label="true"];
    block17 -> block47;
    block19 -> block27 [label="true"];
    block19 -> block42 [label="false"];
    block27 -> block27 [label="loop"];
    block27 -> block42;
    block47 -> block19 [label="loop"];
    block47 -> block42;
}
```

This representation includes the nodes (basic blocks) and the edges (control flow) based on the provided IR code. Each basic block is labeled with its identifier, and edges indicate the direction of flow, with conditions specified where applicable.
