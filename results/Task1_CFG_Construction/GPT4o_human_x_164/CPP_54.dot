To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given intermediate representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will create nodes for each basic block and edges to represent the flow of control between these blocks.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph for the provided IR code:

```dot

This representation captures the control flow structure of the provided IR code, with nodes corresponding to each basic block and directed edges indicating the flow of control between them. Each node is labeled with its corresponding basic block identifier from the IR code.
