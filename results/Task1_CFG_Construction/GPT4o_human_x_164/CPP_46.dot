Based on the provided IR code, we can construct a control flow graph (CFG) representing the flow of control through the function. Below is the DOT representation of the CFG, where each node represents a basic block, and edges represent the control flow between them.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block_1 [label="Block 1"];
    block_6 [label="Block 6"];
    block_10 [label="Block 10"];
    block_14 [label="Block 14"];
    block_17 [label="Block 17"];
    block_23 [label="Block 23"];
    block_34 [label="Block 34"];
    block_38 [label="Block 38"];
    exit [label="Exit"];

    // Define edges
    entry -> block_1;
    block_1 -> block_6;
    block_6 -> block_10;
    block_6 -> block_34;
    block_10 -> block_14;
    block_10 -> block_17;
    block_14 -> block_38;
    block_17 -> block_23;
    block_17 -> block_34;
    block_23 -> block_34;
    block_38 -> block_34;
    block_34 -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each block is represented as a node in the graph. The labels correspond to the basic block numbers from the IR code.
- **Edges**: Directed edges between nodes represent the flow of control. For example, from `entry` to `block_1`, and from `block_6` to both `block_10` and `block_34`, etc.

### Notes:
- The node labels are generic for clarity, but they can be further customized or expanded based on specific block content if needed.
- The `entry` node represents the starting point of the function, and the `exit` node signifies the end of the function.
