To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will generate nodes for each basic block and edges based on the control flow defined by the branches and jumps in the code.

Below is the dot representation of the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];

    start [label="Entry"];
    b2 [label="%2"];
    b3 [label="%3"];
    b4 [label="%4"];
    b5 [label="%5"];
    b6 [label="%6"];
    b7 [label="%7"];
    b10 [label="%10"];
    b21 [label="%21"];
    b25 [label="%25"];
    b27 [label="%27"];
    b29 [label="%29"];
    b33 [label="%33"];
    b38 [label="%38"];
    b40 [label="%40"];
    b42 [label="%42"];
    b54 [label="%54"];
    b57 [label="%57"];
    b59 [label="%59"];
    b61 [label="%61"];
    b63 [label="%63"];
    b64 [label="%64"];
    b65 [label="%65"];
    b73 [label="%73"];
    b77 [label="%77"];
    b79 [label="%79"];
    b83 [label="%83"];
    b85 [label="%85"];
    b87 [label="%87"];
    b94 [label="%94"];
    b95 [label="%95"];
    b98 [label="%98"];
    b101 [label="%101"];

    start -> b2;
    b2 -> b3;
    b3 -> b4;
    b4 -> b5;
    b5 -> b6;
    b6 -> b7;
    b7 -> b10;
    b10 -> b21;
    b21 -> b25;
    b25 -> b27;
    b25 -> b29;
    b27 -> b87;
    b29 -> b33;
    b33 -> b40;
    b33 -> b38;
    b40 -> b87;
    b21 -> b42;
    b42 -> b54;
    b54 -> b57;
    b57 -> b59;
    b57 -> b61;
    b61 -> b63;
    b63 -> b64;
    b64 -> b85;
    b61 -> b65;
    b65 -> b73;
    b73 -> b77;
    b77 -> b79;
    b79 -> b87;
    b42 -> b54;
    b54 -> b57;
    b57 -> b87;
    b87 -> b94;
    b94 -> b95;
    b95 -> b98;
    b98 -> b101;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph, labeled appropriately.
- Directed edges (arrows) illustrate the flow of control from one block to another based on the branching logic in the IR code.
- The entry point is marked as "Entry" that leads to the first block, `%2`. 
- The structure of the CFG is based on the control flow defined by branching instructions (`br`, `invoke`, etc.) and the structure of the IR code provided.

You can visualize this graph using graph visualization tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
