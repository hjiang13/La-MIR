To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their corresponding edges based on the control flow defined in the IR code. In the provided IR code, basic blocks are typically identified by labels followed by a colon (e.g., `5:`, `12:`, etc.). Hereâ€™s how the CFG can be expressed in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    1 [label="Entry"]
    24 [label="Return"]
    
    1 -> 4 [label="Start"]
    4 -> 24 [label="Return"]
    
    24 -> 5 [label="False Condition"]
    24 -> 12 [label="True Condition"]
    
    5 -> 10 [label="False Condition"]
    5 -> 12 [label="True Condition"]
    
    10 -> 26 [label="Continue"]
    
    12 -> 18 [label="False Condition"]
    12 -> 24 [label="True Condition"]
    
    18 -> 24 [label="End"]
    
    26 -> 41 [label="Continue"]
    
    41 -> 42 [label="Next"]
    
    42 -> 59 [label="Continue"]
    
    59 -> 12 [label="Loop Back"]
    59 -> 26 [label="Loop Back"]
    
    // Add additional edges as necessary based on the provided IR code
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node corresponds to a basic block.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another based on the conditional branches and jumps present in the IR code.
- The labels on the edges describe the conditions or actions leading from one block to another.
- The starting node (Entry) represents the entry point of the function, and the Return node represents the exit point.

This CFG captures the structure of the control flow based on the IR code provided. Adjust the labels and edges as needed based on a more detailed analysis of the IR code if specific conditions or logic are required.
