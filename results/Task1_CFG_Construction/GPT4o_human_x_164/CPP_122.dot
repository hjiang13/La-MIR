Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, here's the control flow graph represented in DOT format. Each basic block is represented as a node, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block_2 [label="%2"];
    block_4 [label="%4"];
    block_9 [label="%9"];
    block_16 [label="%16"];
    block_18 [label="%18"];
    block_55 [label="%55"];
    block_62 [label="%62"];
    block_77 [label="%77"];
    block_83 [label="%83"];
    block_86 [label="%86"];
    block_88 [label="%88"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_4;
    block_4 -> block_9;
    block_9 -> block_16;
    block_9 -> block_55;
    block_16 -> block_18;
    block_18 -> block_18; // Loop back
    block_18 -> block_55;
    block_55 -> block_62;
    block_55 -> block_77;
    block_62 -> block_77;
    block_77 -> block_83;
    block_77 -> block_86;
    block_83 -> block_88;
    block_86 -> block_88;
    block_88 -> block_86; // Loop back
}
```

In this graph:
- Each labeled node corresponds to a basic block from the IR code.
- The directed edges represent possible paths of execution (control flow) between the blocks.
- The entry point is indicated, and nodes are connected based on the structure of the IR code. 

You can visualize this graph using any DOT viewer or graph visualization tool that supports the DOT language.
