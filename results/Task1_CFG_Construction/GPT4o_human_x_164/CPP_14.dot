Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will generate a Control Flow Graph (CFG) in DOT format. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and edges will be created to represent the control flow between those blocks.

Here is the DOT format for the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    start [label="start"];
    entry [label="entry"];
    b2 [label="b2"];
    b3 [label="b3"];
    b30 [label="b30"];
    b33 [label="b33"];
    b35 [label="b35"];
    b36 [label="b36"];
    b37 [label="b37"];
    b45 [label="b45"];
    b47 [label="b47"];
    b49 [label="b49"];
    b51 [label="b51"];
    b53 [label="b53"];
    b54 [label="b54"];
    b60 [label="b60"];
    b65 [label="b65"];
    b68 [label="b68"];
    b71 [label="b71"];
    b74 [label="b74"];
    b77 [label="b77"];
    b82 [label="b82"];
    b91 [label="b91"];
    b100 [label="b100"];
    b127 [label="b127"];
    b128 [label="b128"];
    b137 [label="b137"];
    b141 [label="b141"];
    b145 [label="b145"];
    b146 [label="b146"];
    b149 [label="b149"];
    b150 [label="b150"];
    b151 [label="b151"];
    b152 [label="b152"];
    b153 [label="b153"];
    
    // Define edges
    start -> entry;
    entry -> b2;
    b2 -> b3;
    b3 -> b30;
    b3 -> b36;
    b30 -> b37;
    b33 -> b36;
    b35 -> b36;
    b36 -> b49;
    b45 -> b47;
    b49 -> b51;
    b51 -> b54;
    b54 -> b60;
    b60 -> b65;
    b65 -> b68;
    b68 -> b71;
    b71 -> b77;
    b74 -> b77;
    b77 -> b91;
    b91 -> b100;
    b100 -> b127;
    b127 -> b128;
    b128 -> b133;
    b133 -> b37;
    b141 -> b145;
    b145 -> b146;
    b146 -> b149;
    b149 -> b150;
    b150 -> b151;
    b151 -> b152;
    b152 -> b153;
}
```

In this representation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node with a label corresponding to that block.
- Directed edges (`->`) represent the control flow from one block to another.

You can use this DOT format to visualize the control flow graph using tools that support the DOT language, such as Graphviz.
