Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the control flow and represent it using a control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format. The IR code contains a single function, which is relatively straightforward. 

Here is the CFG with nodes representing the basic blocks of the function, along with edges representing the control flow between them:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define the nodes
    node [shape=box];
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    BB1 [label="BB1: %2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1"];
    BB2 [label="BB2: %3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0"];
    BB3 [label="BB3: %4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2"];
    Return [label="Return: ret i32 %4"];

    // Define the edges
    Entry -> BB1;
    BB1 -> BB2;
    BB2 -> BB3;
    BB3 -> Return;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**:
  - **Entry**: The entry point of the function where execution begins.
  - **BB1**: Represents the first operation where the value is incremented (`%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`).
  - **BB2**: Represents the multiplication operation (`%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`).
  - **BB3**: Represents the division operation (`%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`).
  - **Return**: Represents the return statement of the function (`ret i32 %4`).

- **Edges**:
  - The edges show the flow of control from the entry point to each subsequent basic block, ending at the return node.

You can visualize this DOT representation using tools that support the DOT language, such as Graphviz.
