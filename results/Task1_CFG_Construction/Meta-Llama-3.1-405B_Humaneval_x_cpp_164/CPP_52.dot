After analyzing the provided IR code, I have constructed the control flow graph (CFG) for the function `_Z15below_thresholdSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi`. Here is the CFG in the dot file format:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    2[label="2"];
    12[label="12"];
    16[label="16"];
    19[label="19"];
    24[label="24"];
    26[label="26"];

    2 -> 26[label=""];
    2 -> 12[label=""];
    12 -> 26[label=""];
    12 -> 16[label=""];
    16 -> 24[label=""];
    16 -> 19[label=""];
    19 -> 16[label=""];
    19 -> 24[label=""];
    24 -> 26[label=""];
}
```

In this CFG, each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The node labels correspond to the basic block numbers in the IR code. Note that I've only included the node titles and edges in the dot file, as per your request.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
