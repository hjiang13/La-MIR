After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the control flow graph (CFG) in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="Entry"];
    3[label="BB3"];
    10[label="BB10"];
    12[label="BB12"];
    19[label="BB19"];

    1 -> 3[label=""];
    1 -> 10[label=""];
    3 -> 12[label=""];
    3 -> 19[label=""];
    10 -> 1[label=""];
    12 -> 12[label=""];
    12 -> 19[label=""];
    19 -> 10[label=""];
    19 -> 3[label=""];
}
```

In this CFG, the nodes represent the basic blocks (BB) in the IR code, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each node corresponds to the title of the basic block. Note that I've omitted the content of each basic block as per your request.

The edges in the graph represent the control flow between the basic blocks. For example, the edge from node 1 to node 3 indicates that the control flow can move from the entry point (node 1) to basic block 3 (node 3). Similarly, the edge from node 12 to node 12 represents a self-loop, indicating that the control flow can stay within basic block 12.
