After analyzing the provided IR code, I've extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="Entry"];
    6[label="Block 6"];
    8[label="Block 8"];
    16[label="Block 16"];
    18[label="Block 18"];
    1 -> 6[label=""];
    1 -> 18[label=""];
    6 -> 8[label=""];
    6 -> 18[label=""];
    8 -> 8[label=""];
    8 -> 16[label=""];
    16 -> 18[label=""];
}
```

In this dot file, each node represents a basic block in the CFG, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each node corresponds to the title of the basic block.

Note that the dot file can be visualized using tools like Graphviz to get a graphical representation of the CFG.
