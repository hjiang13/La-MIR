After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the control flow graph (CFG) for the function `_Z15closest_integerNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`. Here is the CFG in the dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    entry[label="Entry"];
    bb1[label="bb1"];
    bb2[label="bb2"];
    exit[label="Exit"];

    entry -> bb1;
    bb1 -> bb2;
    bb2 -> exit;
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each node:

* `entry`: The entry point of the function.
* `bb1`: The first basic block, which loads the string pointer and calls `strtod`.
* `bb2`: The second basic block, which calls `llvm.round.f64`, converts the result to an integer, and returns.
* `exit`: The exit point of the function.

The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. In this case, the control flow is straightforward: the function enters at `entry`, flows through `bb1` and `bb2`, and exits at `exit`.

Note that this CFG is quite simple because the function has no conditional statements or loops. If the function were more complex, the CFG would have more nodes and edges to represent the different control flow paths.
