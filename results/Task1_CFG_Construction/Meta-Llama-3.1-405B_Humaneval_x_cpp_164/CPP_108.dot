After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="entry"];
    10[label="block 10"];
    13[label="block 13"];
    15[label="block 15"];
    21[label="block 21"];
    24[label="block 24"];
    31[label="block 31"];
    36[label="block 36"];

    1 -> 10[label=""];
    1 -> 13[label=""];
    10 -> 15[label=""];
    13 -> 36[label=""];
    15 -> 21[label=""];
    15 -> 36[label=""];
    21 -> 24[label=""];
    21 -> 31[label=""];
    24 -> 24[label=""];
    24 -> 31[label=""];
    31 -> 36[label=""];
    36 -> 13[label=""];
    36 -> 15[label=""];
}
```

This dot file represents the CFG, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. The label on each edge is empty, as you requested.

To visualize the CFG, you can use a tool like Graphviz to render the dot file as an image.
