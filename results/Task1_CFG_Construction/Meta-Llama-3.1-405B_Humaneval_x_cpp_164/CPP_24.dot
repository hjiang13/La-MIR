After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the control flow graph in dot format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="entry"];
    3[label="body"];
    8[label="body"];
    12[label="exit"];

    1 -> 3[label=""];
    1 -> 12[label=""];
    3 -> 8[label=""];
    3 -> 12[label=""];
    8 -> 3[label=""];
    8 -> 12[label=""];
}
```

In this graph, each node represents a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between basic blocks. The label on each edge indicates the condition under which the control flow occurs (in this case, the labels are empty, indicating unconditional jumps).

Note that I removed the unnecessary details from the IR code and only kept the essential information to construct the control flow graph. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on any part of the graph!
