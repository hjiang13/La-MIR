After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the DOT format. Here is the output:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    Entry[label="Entry"];
    BB2[label="BB2"];
    BB12[label="BB12"];
    BB14[label="BB14"];
    BB24[label="BB24"];
    BB28[label="BB28"];
    BB31[label="BB31"];
    Exit[label="Exit"];

    Entry -> BB2;
    BB2 -> BB12[label="!%11"];
    BB2 -> BB28[label="%oks11"];
    BB12 -> BB14;
    BB14 -> BB24[label="%23"];
    BB14 -> BB31[label="!%23"];
    BB24 -> BB14[label="!%27"];
    BB24 -> BB28[label="%27"];
    BB28 -> BB31;
    BB31 -> Exit;
}
```

This DOT file represents the CFG, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between these basic blocks.
