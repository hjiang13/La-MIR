After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the control flow graph (CFG) in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    2[label="Entry"];
    4[label="BB4"];
    9[label="BB9"];
    12[label="BB12"];

    2 -> 4[label=""];
    2 -> 12[label=""];
    4 -> 9[label=""];
    4 -> 12[label=""];
    9 -> 12[label=""];
}
```

In this graph, each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each node is the title of the corresponding basic block. Note that I didn't include the content of each basic block as per your request.

Here's a brief explanation of the graph:

* Node 2 is the entry point of the function.
* Node 4 (BB4) is a basic block that conditionally branches to either Node 9 (BB9) or Node 12 (BB12).
* Node 9 (BB9) is a basic block that unconditionally branches to Node 12 (BB12).
* Node 12 (BB12) is the exit point of the function, which returns the result.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
