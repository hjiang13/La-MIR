After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="Entry"];
    8[label="BB8"];
    13[label="BB13"];
    16[label="BB16"];
    19[label="BB19"];
    25[label="BB25"];
    31[label="BB31"];
    35[label="BB35"];

    1 -> 8[label=""];
    1 -> 31[label=""];
    8 -> 13[label=""];
    8 -> 31[label=""];
    13 -> 16[label=""];
    13 -> 19[label=""];
    16 -> 35[label=""];
    19 -> 25[label=""];
    19 -> 31[label=""];
    25 -> 31[label=""];
    35 -> 19[label=""];
    35 -> 35[label=""];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph of the provided IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each edge represents the condition under which the control flow transfers from one basic block to another.

To visualize the graph, you can use a tool like Graphviz. Save this output to a file with a `.dot` extension and run the following command:

```
dot -Tpng cfg.dot -o cfg.png
```

This will generate a PNG image representing the control flow graph.
