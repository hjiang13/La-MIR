After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    start[label="start"];
    BB1[label="BB1"];
    BB2[label="BB2"];
    end[label="end"];

    start -> BB1;
    BB1 -> BB2;
    BB2 -> end;
}
```

In this CFG, I identified the following basic blocks:

* `start`: The entry point of the function.
* `BB1`: The basic block containing the instructions `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`, `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`, and `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`.
* `BB2`: The basic block containing the `ret i32 %4` instruction.
* `end`: The exit point of the function.

The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. In this case, the control flow is straightforward: the function starts at `start`, executes the instructions in `BB1`, then executes the instruction in `BB2`, and finally returns at `end`.
