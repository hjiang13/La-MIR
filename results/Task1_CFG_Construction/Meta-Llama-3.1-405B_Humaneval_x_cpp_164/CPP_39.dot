After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the control flow graph (CFG) in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="entry"];
    2[label="2"];
    9[label="9"];
    17[label="17"];
    19[label="19"];
    24[label="24"];

    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 2[label="loop"];
    2 -> 19;
    19 -> 2;
    19 -> 24;
    2 -> 9;
    9 -> 9[label="loop"];
    9 -> 17;
    17 -> 19;
}
```

In this CFG, each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The labels on the nodes correspond to the labels in the IR code. The edge from node 2 to itself represents the loop, as indicated by the `!llvm.loop` metadata. 

Please note that this CFG does not include the implicit edges from the entry node to the exit node, as they are not explicitly represented in the IR code. If you'd like to include those edges, I can modify the CFG accordingly.
