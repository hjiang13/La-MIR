After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="Function Entry"];
    11[label="Block 11"];
    13[label="Block 13"];
    19[label="Block 19"];
    23[label="Block 23"];
    29[label="Block 29"];
    32[label="Block 32"];

    1 -> 11[label=""];
    1 -> 32[label=""];
    11 -> 13[label=""];
    13 -> 13[label=""];
    13 -> 32[label=""];
    13 -> 19[label=""];
    19 -> 23[label=""];
    19 -> 29[label=""];
    23 -> 32[label=""];
    23 -> 29[label=""];
    29 -> 13[label=""];
    29 -> 32[label=""];
}
```

This dot file represents the CFG, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. The nodes are labeled with the corresponding block numbers. Note that the content of each basic block is not included in this representation, as per your request.
