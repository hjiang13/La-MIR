After analyzing the provided IR code, I have generated the control flow graph in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="entry"];
    12[label="bb12"];
    26[label="bb26"];
    33[label="bb33"];
    35[label="bb35"];
    37[label="bb37"];
    39[label="bb39"];
    42[label="bb42"];
    50[label="bb50"];

    1 -> 12[label=""];
    1 -> 50[label=""];
    12 -> 26[label=""];
    26 -> 33[label=""];
    26 -> 42[label=""];
    33 -> 35[label=""];
    33 -> 42[label=""];
    35 -> 37[label=""];
    35 -> 42[label=""];
    37 -> 39[label=""];
    37 -> 42[label=""];
    39 -> 42[label=""];
    42 -> 26[label=""];
    42 -> 50[label=""];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph of the provided IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each node corresponds to the title of each basic block. Note that I've only included the node titles and edges in the output, as per your request.
