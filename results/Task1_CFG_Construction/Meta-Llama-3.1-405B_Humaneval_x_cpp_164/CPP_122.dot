After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    2[label="Entry"];
    4[label="Cond"];
    9[label="Cond"];
    16[label="Loop_Init"];
    18[label="Loop_Header"];
    55[label="Loop_Merge"];
    62[label="Cond"];
    77[label="Merge"];
    83[label="Cond"];
    86[label="Exit"];
    88[label="Loop_Header"];

    2 -> 4[label=""];
    2 -> 86[label=""];
    4 -> 9[label=""];
    4 -> 83[label=""];
    9 -> 16[label=""];
    9 -> 55[label=""];
    16 -> 18[label=""];
    18 -> 18[label=""];
    18 -> 55[label=""];
    55 -> 62[label=""];
    55 -> 77[label=""];
    62 -> 77[label=""];
    77 -> 83[label=""];
    77 -> 86[label=""];
    83 -> 88[label=""];
    86 -> 88[label=""];
    88 -> 88[label=""];
    88 -> 86[label=""];
}
```

This dot file represents the CFG, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. Note that I've only included the title of each node (i.e., the basic block number) and not the contents of each basic block.

To visualize the CFG, you can use a tool like Graphviz to render the dot file as an image.
