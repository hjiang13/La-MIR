After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the DOT format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="1"];
    3[label="3"];
    10[label="10"];
    12[label="12"];
    18[label="18"];
    28[label="28"];
    30[label="30"];

    1 -> 28[label=""];
    1 -> 3[label=""];
    3 -> 10[label=""];
    3 -> 12[label=""];
    10 -> 30[label=""];
    12 -> 18[label=""];
    12 -> 28[label=""];
    18 -> 18[label=""];
    18 -> 28[label=""];
    30 -> 12[label=""];
    30 -> 30[label=""];
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. Note that I've only included the node titles, as per your request.

To visualize the CFG, you can use a tool like Graphviz, which can render the DOT file into a graphical representation.
