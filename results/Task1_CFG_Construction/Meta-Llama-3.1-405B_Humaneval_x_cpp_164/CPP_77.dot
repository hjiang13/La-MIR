After analyzing the provided IR code, I'll generate the control flow graph (CFG) in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label="CFG of @_Z7iscuberi(i32 %0)";

    node1[label="%1"];
    node3[label="%3"];
    node9[label="%9"];

    node1 -> node3[label=""];
    node3 -> node3[label=""];
    node3 -> node9[label=""];
}
```

In this CFG:

*   `node1` represents the entry block.
*   `node3` represents the loop body.
*   `node9` represents the exit block.
*   The edges represent the control flow between the blocks. The edge from `node3` to itself represents the loop.

Note that I've kept the node labels simple, using the block numbers from the IR code. If you'd like me to include more information in the node labels, please let me know!
