After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the DOT format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="entry"];
    5[label="bb5"];
    8[label="bb8"];
    10[label="bb10"];
    23[label="bb23"];
    25[label="bb25"];

    1 -> 5[label=""];
    1 -> 25[label=""];
    5 -> 10[label=""];
    8 -> 10[label=""];
    8 -> 23[label=""];
    10 -> 8[label=""];
    10 -> 25[label=""];
    23 -> 25[label=""];
}
```

In this graph, each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each edge is empty, as you requested.

Note that I used the following basic block naming convention:

* `1` represents the entry point of the function.
* `5`, `8`, `10`, `23`, and `25` represent the corresponding basic blocks in the IR code.

You can visualize this graph using a tool like Graphviz. If you have any further requests or questions, feel free to ask!
