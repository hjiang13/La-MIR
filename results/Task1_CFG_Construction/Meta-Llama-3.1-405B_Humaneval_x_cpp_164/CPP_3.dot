After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the control flow graph (CFG) in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="Entry"];
    11[label="Block 11"];
    15[label="Block 15"];
    19[label="Block 19"];
    25[label="Block 25"];
    27[label="Exit"];

    1 -> 11[label=""];
    1 -> 27[label=""];
    11 -> 15[label=""];
    11 -> 27[label=""];
    15 -> 19[label=""];
    15 -> 25[label=""];
    19 -> 15[label=""];
    19 -> 25[label=""];
    25 -> 27[label=""];
}
```

In this CFG, each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The node labels correspond to the block numbers in the IR code.

Note that I've omitted the contents of each basic block, as per your request, and only shown the title of each node.
