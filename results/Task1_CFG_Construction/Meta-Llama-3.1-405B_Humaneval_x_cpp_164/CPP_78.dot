After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="entry"];
    12[label="block 12"];
    26[label="block 26"];
    32[label="block 32"];
    34[label="block 34"];
    36[label="block 36"];
    38[label="block 38"];
    40[label="block 40"];
    43[label="block 43"];
    50[label="exit"];

    1 -> 12[label=""];
    1 -> 50[label=""];
    12 -> 26[label=""];
    26 -> 32[label=""];
    26 -> 43[label=""];
    32 -> 34[label=""];
    32 -> 43[label=""];
    34 -> 36[label=""];
    34 -> 43[label=""];
    36 -> 38[label=""];
    36 -> 43[label=""];
    38 -> 40[label=""];
    38 -> 43[label=""];
    40 -> 43[label=""];
    43 -> 26[label=""];
    43 -> 50[label=""];
}
```

This dot file represents the CFG, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. The label on each edge is empty, as you only requested the title of each node.

To visualize the CFG, you can use a tool like Graphviz to render the dot file as an image.
