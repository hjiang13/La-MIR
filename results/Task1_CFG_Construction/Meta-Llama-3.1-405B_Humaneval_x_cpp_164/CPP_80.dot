After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the control flow graph (CFG) in the dot file format. Here's the output:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="1"];
    5[label="5"];
    13[label="13"];
    16[label="16"];
    20[label="20"];
    29[label="29"];
    32[label="32"];

    1 -> 5[label=""];
    1 -> 32[label=""];
    5 -> 20[label=""];
    5 -> 29[label=""];
    13 -> 16[label=""];
    13 -> 29[label=""];
    16 -> 20[label=""];
    16 -> 29[label=""];
    20 -> 13[label=""];
    20 -> 29[label=""];
    29 -> 32[label=""];
}
```

Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label for each edge is empty, as per your request.

Please note that this CFG represents the control flow within the provided function (`_Z8is_happyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`). If you'd like me to explain any part of the CFG or provide additional information, feel free to ask!
