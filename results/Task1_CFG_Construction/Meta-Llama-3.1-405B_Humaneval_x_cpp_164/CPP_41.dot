After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph. Here is the output in DOT format:
```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    edge[dir=back];

    ENTRY[label="ENTRY"];
    BB1[label="BB1"];
    BB2[label="BB2"];
    EXIT[label="EXIT"];

    ENTRY -> BB1;
    BB1 -> BB2;
    BB2 -> EXIT;
}
```
Here's a brief explanation of the nodes:

* `ENTRY`: The entry point of the function.
* `BB1`: The first basic block, which contains the multiplication instruction.
* `BB2`: The second basic block, which contains the return instruction.
* `EXIT`: The exit point of the function.

The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. In this case, the control flow is straightforward: the function enters at `ENTRY`, executes `BB1`, then `BB2`, and finally exits at `EXIT`.
