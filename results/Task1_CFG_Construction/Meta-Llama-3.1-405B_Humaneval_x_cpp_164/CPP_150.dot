After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the control flow graph (CFG) in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    3[label="entry"];
    7[label="if.then"];
    12[label="if.else"];

    3 -> 7[label=""];
    3 -> 12[label=""];
    12 -> 7[label=""];
    12 -> 12[label=""];
    7 -> 7[label=""];
}
```

In this CFG:

* Node `3` represents the entry point of the function.
* Node `7` represents the basic block that starts with the label `7` in the IR code.
* Node `12` represents the basic block that starts with the label `12` in the IR code.

The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. The edge labels are empty, as the IR code doesn't provide any specific information about the conditions or values passed between the blocks.

Note that the CFG has a loop structure, where node `12` has an edge pointing back to itself, indicating a potential loop in the code.
