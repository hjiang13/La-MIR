After analyzing the provided IR code, I've extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    BB1[label="BB1"];
    BB2[label="BB2"];
    BB3[label="BB3"];
    BB4[label="BB4"];

    BB1 -> BB2;
    BB2 -> BB3;
    BB3 -> BB4;
}
```

In this CFG, there are four basic blocks: BB1, BB2, BB3, and BB4. The edges represent the control flow between these basic blocks.

Here's a brief description of each basic block:

* BB1: The entry point of the function `_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`.
* BB2: The block containing the `getelementptr` instruction.
* BB3: The block containing the `load` instruction.
* BB4: The block containing the `trunc` instruction and the `ret` instruction.

Please note that this CFG is a simplified representation, and the actual CFG may contain more nodes and edges depending on the specific LLVM IR code.
