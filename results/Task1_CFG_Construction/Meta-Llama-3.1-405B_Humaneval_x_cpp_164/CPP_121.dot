What a lovely piece of IR code!

After analyzing the control flow, I'll provide you with the control flow graph in DOT format. Here it is:
```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"];
    10[label="10"];
    17[label="17"];
    20[label="20"];
    66[label="66"];
    70[label="70"];
    74[label="74"];
    76[label="76"];

    1 -> 74[label=""];
    1 -> 10[label=""];
    10 -> 70[label=""];
    10 -> 17[label=""];
    17 -> 20[label=""];
    20 -> 20[label=""];
    20 -> 66[label=""];
    66 -> 74[label=""];
    66 -> 70[label=""];
    70 -> 76[label=""];
    74 -> 74[label=""];
    76 -> 76[label=""];
    76 -> 74[label=""];
}
```
Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each edge is empty, as you requested.

To visualize the graph, you can use a tool like Graphviz. Save this DOT file to a file (e.g., `cfg.dot`) and run `dot -Tpng cfg.dot -o cfg.png` to generate a PNG image. Open the image to see the control flow graph.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
