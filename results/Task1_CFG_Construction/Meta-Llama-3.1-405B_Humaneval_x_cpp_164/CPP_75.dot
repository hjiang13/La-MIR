I'll analyze the provided IR code and generate a control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format.

After analyzing the code, I identified the following basic blocks and their connections:

Here is the CFG in DOT format:
```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="1"];
    3[label="3"];
    11[label="11"];
    14[label="14"];
    23[label="23"];

    1 -> 3[label=""];
    1 -> 11[label=""];
    3 -> 14[label=""];
    3 -> 23[label=""];
    11 -> 23[label=""];
    14 -> 14[label=""];
    14 -> 23[label=""];
    23 -> 3[label=""];
    23 -> 11[label=""];
}
```
In this CFG, each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each edge is empty, as you requested.

Please note that the CFG only shows the control flow between basic blocks and does not include any information about the contents of each block.
