After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    Entry[label="Entry"];
    BB1[label="BB1"];
    BB2[label="BB2"];
    Exit[label="Exit"];

    Entry -> BB1;
    BB1 -> BB2;
    BB2 -> Exit;
}
```

In this CFG:

*   `Entry` represents the entry point of the function.
*   `BB1` and `BB2` are the basic blocks in the function.
*   `Exit` represents the exit point of the function.
*   The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks.

Note that this CFG is quite simple, as the input IR code only contains a single function with a straightforward control flow.
