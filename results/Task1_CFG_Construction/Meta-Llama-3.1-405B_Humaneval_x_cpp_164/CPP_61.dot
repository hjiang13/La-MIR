After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="Entry"];
    5[label="BB5"];
    8[label="BB8"];
    10[label="BB10"];
    23[label="BB23"];
    25[label="BB25"];

    1 -> 25[label=""];
    1 -> 5[label=""];
    5 -> 10[label=""];
    8 -> 10[label=""];
    8 -> 23[label=""];
    10 -> 8[label=""];
    10 -> 25[label=""];
    23 -> 25[label=""];
}
```

In this dot file, each node represents a basic block in the CFG. The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. The label on each edge is empty, indicating an unconditional jump.

You can visualize this graph using Graphviz or any other tool that supports the dot file format.
