After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the DOT format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label = "Control Flow Graph";

    node3[label="3"];
    node12[label="12"];
    node18[label="18"];
    node24[label="24"];
    node25[label="25"];

    node3 -> node12[label=""];
    node3 -> node25[label=""];
    node12 -> node18[label=""];
    node12 -> node25[label=""];
    node18 -> node24[label=""];
    node18 -> node25[label=""];
    node24 -> node25[label=""];
}
```

In this graph, each node represents a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between these basic blocks. The label on each edge is empty, indicating that the control flow is unconditional.

Note that the node labels correspond to the label numbers in the IR code. For example, `node3` corresponds to the basic block labeled `3` in the IR code.

You can use a tool like Graphviz to visualize this graph.
