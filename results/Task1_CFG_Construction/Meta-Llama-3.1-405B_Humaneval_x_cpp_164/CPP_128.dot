After analyzing the provided IR code, I've extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the DOT format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="Entry"];
    10[label="BB10"];
    15[label="BB15"];
    17[label="BB17"];
    44[label="BB44"];
    51[label="BB51"];
    61[label="BB61"];
    65[label="BB65"];

    1 -> 10[label=""];
    1 -> 65[label=""];
    10 -> 44[label=""];
    10 -> 15[label=""];
    15 -> 17[label=""];
    17 -> 17[label=""];
    17 -> 44[label=""];
    44 -> 51[label=""];
    44 -> 61[label=""];
    51 -> 61[label=""];
    61 -> 65[label=""];
}
```

This DOT file represents the CFG, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between these basic blocks. You can use a tool like Graphviz to visualize the CFG.

Please note that I've only included the node titles, as per your request. If you need the content of each basic block, please let me know, and I'll be happy to provide it.
