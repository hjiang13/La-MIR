After analyzing the provided IR code, I've extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    2[label="2"];
    4[label="4"];
    8[label="8"];
    10[label="10"];
    14[label="14"];
    21[label="21"];
    23[label="23"];

    2 -> 4[label=""];
    2 -> 21[label=""];
    4 -> 8[label=""];
    4 -> 10[label=""];
    8 -> 23[label=""];
    10 -> 14[label=""];
    10 -> 21[label=""];
    14 -> 14[label=""];
    14 -> 21[label=""];
    21 -> 2[label=""];
    23 -> 10[label=""];
    23 -> 23[label=""];
}
```

In this dot file, each node represents a basic block in the IR code, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The labels on the edges are empty, as you requested, to keep the graph simple and focused on the control flow structure. You can use this dot file to visualize the CFG using tools like Graphviz.
