After analyzing the provided IR code, I've extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the DOT format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"];
    11[label="11"];
    13[label="13"];
    17[label="17"];
    25[label="25"];
    27[label="27"];
    32[label="32"];
    38[label="38"];
    40[label="40"];
    47[label="47"];

    1 -> 11[label=""];
    1 -> 47[label=""];
    11 -> 17[label=""];
    13 -> 17[label=""];
    13 -> 47[label=""];
    17 -> 13[label=""];
    17 -> 27[label=""];
    25 -> 13[label=""];
    25 -> 27[label=""];
    27 -> 13[label=""];
    27 -> 32[label=""];
    32 -> 40[label=""];
    38 -> 25[label=""];
    38 -> 40[label=""];
    40 -> 38[label=""];
    40 -> 47[label=""];
    47 -> 1[label=""];
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between these basic blocks.

To visualize the graph, you can use tools like Graphviz or online graph visualization platforms. Please note that this representation only shows the title of each node (i.e., the basic block number) and does not include the contents of each basic block.
