After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    3[label="entry"];
    12[label="block 12"];
    21[label="block 21"];
    
    3 -> 21[label="br i1 %11"];
    3 -> 12[label="br i1 %11"];
    12 -> 21[label="br label %21"];
}
```

In this dot file, each node represents a basic block in the CFG. The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. The labels on the edges indicate the type of control flow (e.g., conditional branch, unconditional branch).

Note that the node labels only show the title of each basic block, as per your request. If you'd like me to include the contents of each basic block, please let me know!
