After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the DOT file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    Entry[label="Entry"];
    BB2[label="BB2"];
    BB5[label="BB5"];
    BB16[label="BB16"];

    Entry -> BB2;
    BB2 -> BB5[label="br i1 %4"];
    BB2 -> BB16[label="br i1 %4"];
    BB5 -> BB5[label="br i1 %15"];
    BB5 -> BB16[label="br i1 %15"];
    BB16 -> Exit;

    Exit[label="Exit"];
}
```

In this CFG, the nodes represent the basic blocks in the IR code, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The labels on the edges indicate the condition under which the control flow is taken.

Here's a brief description of each node:

* `Entry`: The entry point of the function.
* `BB2`: The first basic block, which contains the initial comparisons and branches.
* `BB5`: The loop body, which contains the phi nodes, multiplications, and comparisons.
* `BB16`: The exit block, which contains the return statement.
* `Exit`: The exit point of the function.

Note that the CFG only shows the control flow between basic blocks and does not include the contents of each block.
