After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the control flow graph in dot format. Here it is:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    "%3"[label="entry"];
    "%12"[label="BB1"];
    "%24"[label="BB2"];
    "%3" -> "%12"[label="br i1 %11"];
    "%3" -> "%24"[label="br i1 %11"];
    "%12" -> "%24"[label="br"];
}
```

Let me explain the graph:

*   The graph has three nodes: `%3`, `%12`, and `%24`, representing the basic blocks in the IR code.
*   The node `%3` is the entry point of the function.
*   The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. There are two edges from `%3` to `%12` and `%24`, representing the conditional branch `br i1 %11`. The edge from `%12` to `%24` represents the unconditional branch at the end of the basic block `%12`.

Note that the labels on the edges are not necessary for the graph structure, but I included them to provide more context about the control flow. You can remove them if you prefer a cleaner graph.
