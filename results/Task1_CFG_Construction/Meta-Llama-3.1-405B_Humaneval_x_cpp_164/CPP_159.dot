After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    "4" [label="entry"];
    "8" [label="if.then"];
    "15" [label="if.else"];
    "23" [label="if.end"];

    "4" -> "8" [label="br i1 %5"];
    "4" -> "15" [label="br i1 %5"];
    "8" -> "23" [label="br label %23"];
    "15" -> "23" [label="br label %23"];
}
```

In this dot file, each node represents a basic block in the CFG, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The node labels correspond to the IR code's label numbers. The edge labels indicate the condition or the type of control flow (e.g., unconditional branch).

To visualize the CFG, you can use a tool like Graphviz, which can render the dot file into a graphical representation.

Please note that I only included the nodes and edges in the output, as per your request. If you'd like me to include the content of each basic block, I can provide that as well. Let me know!
