After analyzing the provided IR code, I've extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the DOT format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="entry"];
    10[label="bb10"];
    13[label="bb13"];
    15[label="bb15"];
    21[label="bb21"];
    25[label="bb25"];
    30[label="bb30"];
    33[label="bb33"];

    1 -> 10[label=""];
    1 -> 13[label=""];
    10 -> 15[label=""];
    13 -> 13[label=""];
    13 -> 33[label=""];
    15 -> 21[label=""];
    15 -> 25[label=""];
    21 -> 33[label=""];
    25 -> 30[label=""];
    25 -> 33[label=""];
    30 -> 33[label=""];
    33 -> 13[label=""];
    33 -> 15[label=""];
}
```

This DOT file represents the CFG, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code. The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. Note that I've only included the node titles, as per your request. If you'd like to include the contents of each basic block, please let me know and I can provide an updated output.
