After analyzing the provided IR code, I have generated the control flow graph in dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="entry"];
    7[label="bb7"];
    12[label="bb12"];
    17[label="bb17"];
    19[label="bb19"];
    24[label="bb24"];
    37[label="bb37"];
    41[label="bb41"];

    1 -> 37[label="br"];
    1 -> 7[label="br"];
    7 -> 12[label="br"];
    7 -> 37[label="br"];
    12 -> 17[label="br"];
    12 -> 19[label="br"];
    17 -> 41[label="br"];
    19 -> 24[label="br"];
    19 -> 37[label="br"];
    24 -> 24[label="br"];
    24 -> 37[label="br"];
    41 -> 19[label="br"];
    41 -> 41[label="br"];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph of the provided IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each edge indicates the type of control flow (in this case, all edges represent branches).

You can render this dot file using graphviz tools, such as `dot -Tpng cfg.dot -o cfg.png`, to visualize the control flow graph.
