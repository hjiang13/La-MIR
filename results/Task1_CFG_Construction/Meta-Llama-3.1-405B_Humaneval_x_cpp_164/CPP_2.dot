After analyzing the IR code, I extracted the control flow graph. Here is the output in DOT format:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    entry[label="Entry"];
    bb1[label="BB1"];
    bb2[label="BB2"];
    bb3[label="BB3"];
    bb4[label="BB4"];
    exit[label="Exit"];

    entry -> bb1;
    bb1 -> bb2;
    bb2 -> bb3;
    bb3 -> bb4;
    bb4 -> exit;
}
```

The nodes represent the basic blocks in the IR code:

* `entry`: The entry point of the function.
* `bb1`: The first basic block, which contains the `fptosi` instruction.
* `bb2`: The second basic block, which contains the `sitofp` instruction.
* `bb3`: The third basic block, which contains the `fsub` instruction.
* `bb4`: The fourth basic block, which contains the `ret` instruction.
* `exit`: The exit point of the function.

The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. Note that this is a simple CFG, as there are no conditional jumps or loops in the IR code.
