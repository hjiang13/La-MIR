After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the control flow graph (CFG) in the dot file format. Here it is:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    edge[dir=back];

    entry[label="entry"];
    bb1[label="bb1"];
    bb14[label="bb14"];
    bb19[label="bb19"];
    bb24[label="bb24"];
    bb26[label="bb26"];
    bb29[label="bb29"];
    bb30[label="bb30"];
    bb31[label="bb31"];
    bb32[label="bb32"];
    bb33[label="bb33"];
    bb34[label="bb34"];
    bb35[label="bb35"];
    bb36[label="bb36"];
    bb43[label="bb43"];
    bb48[label="bb48"];
    bb50[label="bb50"];

    entry -> bb1;
    bb1 -> bb43;
    bb1 -> bb14;
    bb14 -> bb19;
    bb19 -> bb24;
    bb19 -> bb36;
    bb24 -> bb36;
    bb26 -> bb36;
    bb29 -> bb36;
    bb30 -> bb36;
    bb31 -> bb36;
    bb32 -> bb36;
    bb33 -> bb36;
    bb34 -> bb36;
    bb35 -> bb36;
    bb36 -> bb19;
    bb36 -> bb43;
    bb43 -> bb48;
    bb43 -> bb50;
    bb48 -> bb50;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph of the provided IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. Note that I've only included the title of each basic block, as per your request.
