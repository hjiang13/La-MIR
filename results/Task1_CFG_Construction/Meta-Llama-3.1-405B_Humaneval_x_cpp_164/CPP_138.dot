After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the control flow graph (CFG) and represented it in the DOT file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, fontname="Arial"];

    Entry [label="Entry"];
    BB1 [label="BB1"];
    BB2 [label="BB2"];
    BB3 [label="BB3"];
    BB4 [label="BB4"];
    Exit [label="Exit"];

    Entry -> BB1;
    BB1 -> BB2 [label="true"];
    BB1 -> BB3 [label="false"];
    BB2 -> BB4;
    BB3 -> Exit;
    BB4 -> Exit;
}
```

In this CFG:

*   `Entry` represents the entry point of the function.
*   `BB1` to `BB4` represent the basic blocks in the function.
*   `Exit` represents the exit point of the function.
*   The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks.

Please note that the labels on the edges (`true` and `false`) indicate the condition under which the control flows from one block to another.
