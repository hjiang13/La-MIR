After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the control flow graph (CFG) in the dot file format. Here's the output:

```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    1[label="Function Entry"];
    11[label="if (%10)"];
    14[label="if (%12)"];
    17[label="if (%16)"];
    21[label="loop (%42)"];
    43[label="if (%46)"];
    48[label="phi (%49)"];
    52[label="phi (%53)"];
    61[label="loop (%71)"];
    72[label="Function Exit"];
    
    1 -> 11;
    1 -> 72;
    11 -> 14;
    11 -> 52;
    14 -> 17;
    14 -> 48;
    17 -> 21;
    21 -> 21[label="loop"];
    21 -> 43;
    43 -> 52;
    43 -> 48;
    48 -> 61;
    52 -> 61;
    52 -> 72;
    61 -> 61[label="loop"];
    61 -> 52;
}
```

Note that I've kept the node labels brief, only showing the title of each basic block. The edges represent the control flow between the blocks. Let me know if you'd like me to clarify any part of the graph!
