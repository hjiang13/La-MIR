After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the control flow graph (CFG) in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    2[label="Entry"];
    3[label="Loop"];
    11[label="Exit"];

    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 3[label="loop"];
    3 -> 11;
}
```

In this graph, the nodes represent the basic blocks in the IR code:

*   Node `2` represents the entry point of the function.
*   Node `3` represents the loop body.
*   Node `11` represents the exit point of the function.

The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks:

*   The edge from `2` to `3` represents the initial branch to the loop body.
*   The edge from `3` to `3` represents the loop back to the beginning of the loop body.
*   The edge from `3` to `11` represents the exit from the loop when the condition is met.

Note that the content of each basic block is not included in this graph, only the title of each node. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
