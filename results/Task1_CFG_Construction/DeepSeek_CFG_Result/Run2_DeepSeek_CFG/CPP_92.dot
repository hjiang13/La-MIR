Okay, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. Let me start by understanding the structure of the code.

The function is `_Z7any_intfff`, which takes three float arguments and returns an i1. The code has several basic blocks, but the key is to identify the labels and the flow between them.

First, I'll look for labels in the code. I see label 3, 12, 21. Wait, label 3 isn't explicitly shown, but it's referenced in the predecessors of other blocks. So, the entry point must be label 3.

From label 3, there's a branch to label 21 if the condition %11 is true, otherwise it goes to label 12. So, the first node is 3, with edges to 12 and 21.

Label 12 has a bunch of operations and ends with a branch to 21. So, node 12 only points to 21.

Label 21 is where the function returns. It has a phi node indicating it can come from either label 3 or 12. So, node 21 has incoming edges from 3 and 12, and it's the exit node.

Putting this together, the CFG has three nodes: 3, 12, and 21. The edges are from 3 to 12, 3 to 21, and 12 to 21.

I should represent this in a dot file. Each node will be a circle with its label. The edges will show the flow direction.

I need to make sure the dot syntax is correct. The nodes are defined with labels, and edges are drawn with arrows.

So, the final CFG in dot format will have nodes 3, 12, and 21 with the appropriate edges.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their connections. Here's the CFG in dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=circle, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue];
    
    label3[label="3"];
    label12[label="12"];
    label21[label="21"];
    
    label3 -> label12;
    label3 -> label21;
    label12 -> label21;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with nodes for each basic block (3, 12, 21) and edges showing the control flow between them.
