Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided an LLVM IR code snippet and want the CFG in dot format, showing nodes and edges without listing the contents of each basic blockâ€”just the titles.

First, I'll need to parse the IR code to identify the basic blocks. In LLVM IR, a basic block is a sequence of instructions ending with a terminator instruction like 'br', 'ret', etc. Each basic block starts with a label.

Looking at the code, the function @_Z13triangle_areafff has several labels: the entry block (implicitly %3), %12, and %24. Wait, the entry block isn't explicitly named here, but I can see the function starts executing at the top, so that's the first block.

So, the first block (let's call it %3) has the initial instructions up to the 'br' instruction. Then, there's a conditional branch to either %12 or %24. That means the first block splits into two paths.

Next, block %12 has instructions from label 12 to the next 'br' to label %24. After that, block %24 is where both paths converge, using a 'phi' instruction to select the return value based on which path was taken.

So, the CFG nodes are:
- Block %3 (entry)
- Block %12
- Block %24

Now, I'll map out the edges. Block %3 branches to %12 and %24. Then, after executing %12, it goes to %24. Block %24 then exits the function with 'ret'.

Wait, but in the code, after block %12, the 'br' goes to %24, and block %24 also has a 'phi' that comes from block %3 as well. So, the edges are from %3 to %12 and %3 to %24, and from %12 to %24.

Putting this into dot format, I'll define each node as a label and draw the edges between them. The title of each node will be its label, like "Block %3", "Block %12", and "Block %24".

I should make sure the dot syntax is correct, with nodes represented as ellipses and edges as arrows. Also, the graph should have a clear structure showing the flow from the entry to the two possible paths and their convergence.

I think that's all. The user just wants the structure without the instructions, so I can present the dot code accordingly.

To construct the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their connections. Here's the CFG in dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=ellipse];

    "%3" [label="Block %3"];
    "%12" [label="Block %12"];
    "%24" [label="Block %24"];

    "%3" -> "%12" [label="conditional branch (true)"];
    "%3" -> "%24" [label="conditional branch (false)"];
    "%12" -> "%24" [label="unconditional branch"];
}
```

This graph shows three nodes representing the basic blocks and their control flow edges. Block %3 is the entry point, leading to either Block %12 or Block %24 based on a condition. Block %12 then proceeds to Block %24, which is the exit point.
