Alright, let's see. The user has provided an IR code and wants a control flow graph in DOT format. They mentioned to focus on the titles of the nodes, not the contents. 

First, I need to understand what a control flow graph is. It's a representation of the program's structure, showing how control flows between different basic blocks. Each node represents a basic block, and edges show jumps or branches between them.

Looking at the IR code, I notice it's in LLVM IR. The function is `_Z10prod_signsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which I think is a function that calculates product signs from a vector of integers. 

I see several labels like 1, 10, 15, etc. Each of these is a basic block. My task is to map how these blocks connect. 

Starting from label 1, it seems to branch to label 65 if a condition is met, otherwise to 10. So node 1 has edges to 65 and 10.

Label 10 has a branch to 44 or 15 based on another condition. So node 10 connects to 44 and 15.

Label 15 loops back to itself under certain conditions, so there's a self-loop. It also goes to 17.

Label 17 is a loop that continues back to itself or exits to 44. So node 17 has a self-loop and an edge to 44.

Label 44 branches to 51 or 61 based on a condition, and then 51 goes back to 61. So node 44 connects to 51 and 61, and 51 goes to 61.

Label 61 goes to 65, and 65 is the exit point.

Putting this all together, I'll structure the DOT file with nodes for each label and edges representing the control flow between them.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    "1" [label="1"];
    "10" [label="10"];
    "15" [label="15"];
    "17" [label="17"];
    "44" [label="44"];
    "51" [label="51"];
    "61" [label="61"];
    "65" [label="65"];
    
    "1" -> "65" [label="br i1 %9, label %65, label %10"];
    "1" -> "10" [label="br i1 %9, label %65, label %10"];
    
    "10" -> "44" [label="br i1 %14, label %44, label %15"];
    "10" -> "15" [label="br i1 %14, label %44, label %15"];
    
    "15" -> "17" [label="br label %17"];
    "17" -> "17" [label="br i1 %43, label %44, label %17"];
    "17" -> "44" [label="br i1 %43, label %44, label %17"];
    
    "44" -> "51" [label="br i1 %50, label %61, label %51"];
    "44" -> "61" [label="br i1 %50, label %61, label %51"];
    
    "51" -> "61" [label="br label %61"];
    
    "61" -> "65" [label="br label %65"];
    
    "65" [label="ret i32 %66"];
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between the different basic blocks in the program. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks. The labels on the edges indicate the branching conditions or transfer operations.
