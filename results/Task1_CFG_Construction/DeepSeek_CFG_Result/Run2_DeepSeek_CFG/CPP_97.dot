Okay, so the user has provided some IR code and wants me to generate a control flow graph (CFG) in dot file format. The CFG should include nodes and edges without listing the contents of each basic block, just their titles.

First, I need to parse the given IR code. The code defines a function `_Z8multiplyii` which takes two integers and returns an integer. The function has several instructions:

1. It calls `llvm.abs.i32` on the first argument and stores the result in `%3`.
2. Then it computes the remainder of `%3` divided by 10, storing it in `%4`.
3. Next, it calls `llvm.abs.i32` on the second argument, storing the result in `%5`.
4. It calculates the remainder of `%5` divided by 10 and stores it in `%6`.
5. Multiplies `%6` and `%4`, storing the result in `%7`.
6. Finally, it returns `%7`.

Looking at the code structure, the function is straightforward with a single basic block. There are no branches or loops, so the CFG will only have one node.

I need to represent this in a dot file. Each node is a basic block, typically labeled with a number or a name. Since there's only one block, I'll name it "Block 1" and show that it has no incoming or outgoing edges because the control flow starts and ends within this single block.

So, the dot file will have a single node without any edges. I'll structure it with the node definition and no edge connections.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, label=""];

    Block1 [label="Block 1"];

    // No edges since the control flow is sequential and there are no branches
}
```

This control flow graph represents the single basic block in the provided IR code. Since there are no control flow instructions (like branches or loops), the graph contains only one node ("Block 1") with no incoming or outgoing edges.
