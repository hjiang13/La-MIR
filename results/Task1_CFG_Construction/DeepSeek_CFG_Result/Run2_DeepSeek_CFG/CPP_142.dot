Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The user has provided an LLVM IR snippet and wants the CFG in DOT format, showing the nodes (basic blocks) and edges without detailing the contents of each block.

First, I need to understand the structure of the IR code. The function in question is `@_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which seems to be a function that calculates the sum of squares of elements in a vector. 

Looking at the IR, I see several labels: 1, 10, 13, 15, 21, 25, 30, 33. Each of these represents a basic block in the CFG. My goal is to determine how these blocks are connected based on the branching instructions.

Starting from the beginning, the function starts at label 1. From there, it computes some addresses and checks if two pointers are equal. If they are equal, it branches to label 13; otherwise, it goes to label 10.

Label 10 seems to handle the case where the pointers aren't equal. It calculates some values and then branches to label 15. Label 15 is a loop where some computations happen based on the remainder of a division by 3. Depending on that, it either goes to label 21, 25, or continues looping.

Label 21 handles the case where the remainder is 0, loading and squaring a value, then branching back to label 33. Label 25 deals with cases where the remainder isn't 0, checking if the lower bits are zero. If they are, it squares the value; otherwise, it cubes it, then goes back to label 33.

Label 33 aggregates the results and increments the loop counter until it reaches the maximum value, then decides whether to exit the loop or continue. Eventually, it either returns the sum at label 13 or continues looping.

To represent this in DOT, each label will be a node. Edges will be drawn based on the branching instructions. I need to ensure that all possible paths are included, even if they loop back.

I should also make sure the graph is properly formatted, with nodes as labels and edges indicating control flow. Since the user requested not to include the content of each block, I'll just use the labels as node names.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the nodes and edges to reflect the flow I've deduced. This should give a clear visual representation of how the function executes.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, color=lightblue];
    
    1 [label="1"];
    10 [label="10"];
    13 [label="13"];
    15 [label="15"];
    21 [label="21"];
    25 [label="25"];
    30 [label="30"];
    33 [label="33"];
    
    1 -> 10 [label=""];
    1 -> 13 [label=""];
    10 -> 15 [label=""];
    15 -> 21 [label=""];
    15 -> 25 [label=""];
    21 -> 33 [label=""];
    25 -> 30 [label=""];
    25 -> 33 [label=""];
    30 -> 33 [label=""];
    33 -> 13 [label=""];
    33 -> 15 [label=""];
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph where:
- Nodes represent the basic blocks in the IR code.
- Edges represent the control flow between blocks.

You can visualize this graph using tools like Graphviz.
