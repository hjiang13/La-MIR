Alright, so I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. First, I should understand what a CFG is. It's a graphical representation of the control flow of a program, where each node represents a basic block, and edges represent jumps or branches between these blocks. Each basic block is a sequence of instructions that are executed in order without any control flow changes within them.

Looking at the IR code, I see it's a function named @_Z15starts_one_endsi which takes an i32 argument. The code is structured with various labels (like 1, 2, 3, etc.) which are the basic blocks. My goal is to map out how these blocks connect based on the branch instructions.

I'll start by listing all the labels to identify each basic block. Then, I'll look at each branch instruction (like br, which has a condition and two possible targets) to determine the edges between the blocks.

For example, the first block after the function definition is block 2. It has a branch instruction that goes to block 57 if the condition is true, and to block 3 if false. So, there's an edge from 2 to 57 and another from 2 to 3.

I'll continue this process for each block, noting the predecessors (incoming edges) and successors (outgoing edges). This way, I'll build the entire graph step by step. Once all edges are mapped, the CFG will be complete.

I also need to make sure that each node is labeled correctly and that all edges are accurately represented, showing the flow between blocks as determined by the branch conditions.

Now, I'll proceed to break down each block and their respective branches to construct the CFG.

To construct the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we first identify each basic block and then determine the edges based on branch instructions. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: Each label in the IR code represents a basic block. The labels found are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 18, 20, 28, 34, 42, 48, 51, 57.

2. **Analyze Branch Instructions**: For each basic block, examine the `br` instructions to determine the control flow. For example:
   - Block 2 branches to 57 or 3.
   - Block 3 branches to 57 or 5.
   - Block 5 branches to 7 or 57.
   - Block 7 branches to 48 or 10.
   - And so on for each block.

3. **Map Edges**: Draw edges from each block to its possible successors based on the branch conditions.

Here is the CFG represented in dot file format, showing nodes as basic blocks and directed edges representing control flow:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    "1" -> "2";
    "2" -> "57";
    "2" -> "3";
    "3" -> "57";
    "3" -> "5";
    "5" -> "7";
    "5" -> "57";
    "7" -> "48";
    "7" -> "10";
    "10" -> "28";
    "10" -> "17" [label="false"];
    "28" -> "42";
    "28" -> "34";
    "34" -> "42";
    "34" -> "34" [label="loop"];
    "42" -> "48";
    "42" -> "57";
    "48" -> "51";
    "51" -> "57";
    "51" -> "51" [label="loop"];
    "57" -> "end";
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between each basic block, with edges indicating possible execution paths based on branch conditions.
