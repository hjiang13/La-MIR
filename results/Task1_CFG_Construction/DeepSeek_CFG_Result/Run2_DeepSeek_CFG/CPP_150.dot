Alright, let me try to work through this problem. So, the user has provided some IR code and wants a control flow graph (CFG) in dot file format. The CFG should show the nodes and edges without listing the contents of each basic blockâ€”just their titles.

First, I need to understand what the IR code represents. It looks like a function named `_Z6x_or_yiii` which takes three integer arguments and returns an integer. The code has several basic blocks labeled with numbers like 3, 7, 12, etc. Each block ends with a branch instruction, either conditional or unconditional, which determines the flow of control.

I remember that in LLVM IR, the basic blocks are labeled with a number or a name, and each block ends with a terminator instruction like `br`, which can be conditional or unconditional. So, to build the CFG, I need to identify all the basic blocks and their successors.

Looking at the code, the function starts with some initial checks. The first block (probably block 3) has a `br` instruction that branches to block 7 or 12 based on the result of a comparison. Then, block 7 has a `ret` instruction, which means it's an exit point. Block 12 seems more complex, with loops and recursive branches.

I think I should list each basic block as a node and then determine the edges based on where each `br` instruction goes. For example, if block 3 branches to block 7 and 12, there should be edges from 3 to 7 and from 3 to 12.

Wait, in the code, after the initial block, the first branch is to 7 or 12. Then block 7 has a `ret`, so it doesn't go anywhere else. Block 12 has a loop with `br` going back to 7 or staying in 12. So, block 12 branches to 7 and itself.

I should also note that block 12 is a loop, as indicated by the `!llvm.loop` metadata. That means it has a back edge, which is the branch from 12 back to itself.

So, putting it all together, the nodes are the basic blocks: 3, 7, 12. The edges are:

- 3 -> 7
- 3 -> 12
- 12 -> 7
- 12 -> 12

I think that's all the blocks and their connections. Now, I need to represent this in a dot file format, showing each node and the directed edges between them.

I should make sure the dot file is correctly formatted, with each node as a label and edges showing the flow. I'll start the graph with `digraph CFG {` and then list each node and edge.

I also need to make sure that the loop from 12 to itself is correctly represented with an edge from 12 to 12.

So, the final dot file should look something like:

```
digraph CFG {
    node3 [label="3"];
    node7 [label="7"];
    node12 [label="12"];

    node3 -> node7;
    node3 -> node12;
    node12 -> node7;
    node12 -> node12;
}
```

I think this accurately represents the control flow of the given IR code. Each node is a basic block, and the edges show the possible paths the execution can take.

To construct the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their control flow paths. Each basic block is a node, and edges represent possible control transfers. Here's the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node3 [label="3"];
    node7 [label="7"];
    node12 [label="12"];

    node3 -> node7;
    node3 -> node12;
    node12 -> node7;
    node12 -> node12;
}
```

This graph shows the basic blocks and their control flow edges. Block 3 branches to blocks 7 and 12. Block 12 loops back to itself and also branches to block 7. Block 7 is a terminal node as it ends with a return instruction.
