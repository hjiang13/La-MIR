Okay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The function is called _Z15is_simple_powerii, which I think is a C++ function that's been compiled. The function takes two integers and returns a boolean. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the code. The code has labels and basic blocks. Each label represents a node in the CFG, and the branches between them represent the edges. 

Looking at the code, I see the function starts with some initial checks. The first few lines compute whether %0 (the first argument) is greater than 0 and greater than 1. Then there's a branch instruction that goes to label 5 if the second condition is true, otherwise to label 16.

So, the initial node is the entry point, let's call it "start". From there, it branches to either label 5 or label 16. Label 5 seems to be a loop because there's a back edge from label 5 to itself. 

Within label 5, there are phi nodes, which are used to merge values from different paths. Phi nodes don't affect the control flow, so I can focus on the branches. The code computes some values, then checks two conditions: whether %8 is less than or equal to %0 and whether %6 is less than 99. It then selects based on these conditions and decides whether to continue the loop or exit.

The loop exits when certain conditions are met, leading to label 16. Label 16 is the exit point where the function returns a value based on the results of the loop.

So, the CFG should have nodes for each label: start, 5, and 16. The edges are from start to 5 and 16, and from 5 back to itself and also to 16 when the loop exits.

I think I've got the structure. Now, I can represent this as a dot file with the nodes and edges as described.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we represent each basic block as a node and each branch as a directed edge between nodes. Here's the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, color=lightblue];
    
    start [label="start"];
    node5 [label="5"];
    node16 [label="16"];
    
    start -> node5 [label="br label %5"];
    start -> node16 [label="br label %16"];
    
    node5 -> node5 [label="br label %5"];
    node5 -> node16 [label="br label %16"];
}
```

This graph shows the control flow starting from the entry point, splitting into two paths, and looping within node 5 until it exits to node 16.
