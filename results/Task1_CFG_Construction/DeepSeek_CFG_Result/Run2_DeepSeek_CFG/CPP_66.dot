Okay, I'm looking at this problem where the user provided an IR code and wants me to generate a control flow graph in dot format. The user is an expert in high-performance computation, so they probably need this for optimizing or analyzing the code's structure.

First, I need to understand the IR code. It's a function called _Z8digitSumNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE, which seems to be a C++ function that calculates the digit sum of a string. The function is written in LLVM IR, which is a low-level, assembly-like intermediate representation used by the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

The function starts with some checks: if the string length is zero, it returns 0. Otherwise, it processes the string in chunks, probably using SIMD instructions for optimization. There are loops handling different cases, like when the string length is less than 8 and when it's longer. The loops process the string in 16-byte increments, converting characters to their digit values and summing them up.

To create the control flow graph, I need to identify all the basic blocks and their connections. Each label in the IR corresponds to a basic block. I'll go through each line, note the labels, and see where the branches (br) and jumps go.

Starting from the beginning, the function has an initial check at label 1. Then, it branches to label 92 if the length is zero, otherwise to label 5. Label 5 checks if the length is less than 8, branching to 89 or 9. Label 9 starts a loop that processes the string in chunks, with labels 16 to 18 handling the SIMD processing. After that, it checks if there's a remainder and processes it in label 66. Finally, it sums up the results and returns.

I also notice that there are loops with labels 18 and 94, which handle the main processing and the remainder processing respectively. Each loop has its own set of instructions and exits when a condition is met.

Putting this all together, I'll map each label as a node and draw edges based on where each branch goes. The final dot file should clearly show the flow from the start to the exit, including all loops and conditional branches.

I think the user might be using this CFG to analyze performance bottlenecks or to optimize the code further. They might be looking for ways to reduce the number of loops or optimize the branching to improve execution speed.

So, I'll structure the dot file with nodes for each label and edges showing the control flow. I'll make sure it's clear and concise, without including the detailed instructions of each block, as per the user's request.

Here is the control flow graph in dot format for the given IR code. The nodes represent basic blocks, and the edges represent control flow between blocks:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, label=""];
    
    start [label="1"];
    92 [label="92"];
    5 [label="5"];
    89 [label="89"];
    9 [label="9"];
    16 [label="16"];
    18 [label="18"];
    59 [label="59"];
    66 [label="66"];
    83 [label="83"];
    94 [label="94"];
    
    start -> 92 [label="br %4, label %92"];
    start -> 5 [label="br %4, label %5"];
    
    5 -> 89 [label="br %8, label %89"];
    5 -> 9 [label="br %8, label %9"];
    
    9 -> 59 [label="br %15, label %59"];
    9 -> 16 [label="br %15, label %16"];
    
    16 -> 18 [label="br label %18"];
    
    18 -> 18 [label="br %58, label %18"];
    18 -> 59 [label="br %58, label %59"];
    
    59 -> 66 [label="br %65, label %66"];
    59 -> 83 [label="br %65, label %83"];
    
    66 -> 83 [label="br label %83"];
    
    83 -> 92 [label="br %88, label %92"];
    83 -> 89 [label="br %88, label %89"];
    
    89 -> 94 [label="br label %94"];
    
    94 -> 92 [label="br %105, label %92"];
    94 -> 94 [label="br %105, label %94"];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with nodes as basic blocks and edges as control flow transitions. Each node is labeled with the basic block number. You can visualize this graph using tools like Graphviz.
