Alright, so I'm trying to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. It's a function named `_Z21double_the_differenceSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`, which takes a vector of floats and returns an i64. The code has several labels: 1, 10, 13, 15, 26, 30, 34. These labels represent the basic blocks in the function.

I need to understand how these blocks are connected. I'll go through each block and see where they branch to.

- **Block 1**: This is the entry block. It loads some pointers from the vector, does some calculations, and then checks if the difference is zero. If it is, it branches to block 13; otherwise, it goes to block 10.

- **Block 10**: Here, it calculates the maximum of half the difference and 1. Then it branches to block 15.

- **Block 13**: This is a return block. It returns the value from %14, which is set by a phi node. The phi node takes 0 from block 1 or %35 from block 34.

- **Block 15**: This block has two phi nodes, %16 and %17, which take initial values of 0 or values from previous iterations. It then loads a float from the vector, rounds it, subtracts to check the fractional part, and decides whether to process it further.

- **Block 26**: This is reached if the fractional part is small. It converts the rounded value to an integer, checks if it's odd, and either branches to block 30 or back to block 34.

- **Block 30**: If the number is odd, it squares the integer part and adds it to a running total before looping back to block 34.

- **Block 34**: This is a loop end. It updates the loop indices and decides whether to loop again or exit. If the loop continues, it goes back to block 15; otherwise, it exits to block 13.

Putting this all together, the CFG starts at block 1, which splits into two paths: one exiting early if the vector is empty and another handling the loop. The loop involves blocks 15, 26, 30, and 34, with 34 controlling the loop continuation or exit.

I think I've got the connections right, but I'm a bit unsure about the phi nodes and how they affect the edges. I'll make sure each block correctly points to where it should based on the branches and labels in the code.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their connections based on branching statements. Here's the structured representation:

- **Block 1**: Entry block that checks if the vector is empty and branches accordingly.
- **Block 10**: Handles the case where the vector is not empty, leading to the loop setup.
- **Block 13**: Exit block when the vector is empty.
- **Block 15**: Loop body initializing variables.
- **Block 26**: Processes each element and checks if it's odd.
- **Block 30**: Handles odd numbers and updates the total.
- **Block 34**: Loop termination check, restarting the loop or exiting.

### Control Flow Graph in DOT Format

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    Block1[label="1"];
    Block10[label="10"];
    Block13[label="13"];
    Block15[label="15"];
    Block26[label="26"];
    Block30[label="30"];
    Block34[label="34"];

    Block1 -> Block10[label="non-zero difference"];
    Block1 -> Block13[label="zero difference"];

    Block10 -> Block15;

    Block15 -> Block26;

    Block26 -> Block30[label="odd"];
    Block26 -> Block34[label="even"];

    Block30 -> Block34;

    Block34 -> Block15[label="continue loop"];
    Block34 -> Block13[label="exit loop"];
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Block 1**: The entry point. It checks if the vector is empty and branches to Block 13 if true, otherwise to Block 10.
2. **Block 10**: Initializes loop variables and proceeds to Block 15.
3. **Block 15**: The loop body processes each vector element.
4. **Block 26**: Checks if the processed element is odd, branching to Block 30 if true, else to Block 34.
5. **Block 30**: Handles odd numbers and updates the total before returning to Block 34.
6. **Block 34**: Checks loop termination. If not terminated, it loops back to Block 15; otherwise, it exits to Block 13.

This graph accurately represents the control flow of the given IR code.
