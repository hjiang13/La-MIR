Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code. The user has given me an LLVM IR code snippet and wants the CFG in a dot file format, showing the nodes (basic blocks) and edges without listing their contents.

First, I need to understand what a control flow graph is. It's a representation of the code where each node is a basic block (a sequence of instructions without any control flow changes), and edges represent possible control flow between these blocks.

Looking at the IR code, I see it's a function named @_Z11count_up_toi, which seems to be part of a vector implementation, possibly related to C++. The function takes a vector and an integer and modifies the vector. The code includes several labels like 2, 7, 10, etc., which are the basic blocks.

My task is to identify all the basic blocks and their connections. I'll start by listing each label as a node. Then, I'll look for branches (br) and other control flow instructions to determine the edges between these nodes.

Starting from the beginning, the function starts at label 2. The first branch is br i1 %5, label %7, label %94. So, from 2, there's an edge to 7 if %5 is true, and to 94 otherwise.

Next, label 7 leads to label 10. Then, label 10 has a phi instruction, which indicates the start of a loop. The loop continues back to 10 after some operations, so there's a cycle here.

Within the loop, there are several conditions and branches. For example, from 10, it branches to 25 if %20 is true. From 25, it goes to 27 or 29 based on another condition. Each of these leads back to 87, which then checks if it should continue the loop or exit.

There are also other labels like 21, 25, 27, etc., each connected based on the branch instructions. Some labels, like 57, have multiple incoming edges from different conditions.

I also notice some exception handling with invoke instructions, like label 29 invoking a memory allocation and handling unwind labels 95 and 83. These need to be represented as edges to their respective unwind blocks, but since the user only wants the basic blocks, I'll include those labels as nodes and connect them accordingly.

Finally, the function exits at label 94. I'll make sure all paths eventually lead here or to the unwind blocks.

I need to ensure that every label is included as a node and that each br instruction correctly connects the nodes with directed edges. I'll structure this in dot language, using node shapes and edges with arrows to show the flow.

After mapping all the connections, I'll compile them into a dot file, making sure it's properly formatted so that it can be visualized.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph cfg {
    node[shape=box, style=filled, label=""];

    2[label="2"];
    7[label="7"];
    10[label="10"];
    21[label="21"];
    25[label="25"];
    27[label="27"];
    29[label="29"];
    33[label="33"];
    38[label="38"];
    40[label="40"];
    42[label="42"];
    54[label="54"];
    57[label="57"];
    59[label="59"];
    61[label="61"];
    63[label="63"];
    64[label="64"];
    65[label="65"];
    73[label="73"];
    77[label="77"];
    79[label="79"];
    87[label="87"];
    94[label="94"];
    95[label="95"];
    98[label="98"];
    101[label="101"];

    2 -> 7;
    2 -> 94;
    7 -> 10;
    10 -> 25;
    10 -> 21;
    21 -> 25;
    21 -> 42;
    25 -> 27;
    25 -> 29;
    27 -> 87;
    29 -> 33;
    33 -> 40;
    38 -> 40;
    40 -> 87;
    42 -> 54;
    42 -> 42;
    54 -> 57;
    54 -> 87;
    57 -> 59;
    57 -> 61;
    59 -> 87;
    61 -> 63;
    61 -> 65;
    63 -> 64;
    65 -> 73;
    73 -> 77;
    73 -> 79;
    77 -> 79;
    79 -> 87;
    87 -> 94;
    87 -> 10;
    94 -> 94;
    95 -> 98;
    95 -> 101;
    98 -> 101;
    101 -> 101;
}
```

This graph shows the basic blocks as nodes and the control flow between them as edges. Each node represents a basic block labeled with its corresponding number. The edges represent transitions between basic blocks based on control flow instructions.
