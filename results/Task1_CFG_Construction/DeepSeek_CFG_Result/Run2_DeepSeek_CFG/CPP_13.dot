Okay, so I need to figure out the control flow graph for the given IR code. Let me start by understanding what the code does. It's a function called greatest_common_divisorii, which takes two i32 parameters and returns an i32. The function is implementing the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.

Looking at the code, it starts with a br label %3, which means the first basic block is label 3. Block 3 has two phi nodes, %4 and %5, which are used to merge values from different paths. Then there's an icmp instruction checking if %5 is less than %4, and based on that, it selects either %5 or %4 for %7 and %8. 

Next, it computes the remainder of %8 divided by %7 and stores it in %9. Then it checks if %9 is zero. If it is, it branches to label 11, which is the return block. If not, it loops back to label 3.

So, the basic blocks are:
1. The entry block, which immediately branches to block 3.
2. Block 3, which is the loop body.
3. Block 11, which is the return statement.

In the control flow graph, each block is a node. The edges show the possible execution paths. The entry block (implicitly before label 3) goes to block 3. Then, within block 3, there's a loop that either continues back to 3 or exits to 11.

I need to represent this with nodes and edges in a dot file. Each node will be labeled with its block number. The edges will show the flow between these nodes. Since the loop continues back to block 3, there's an edge from block 3 to itself. When the loop exits, it goes from block 3 to block 11.

So, the nodes are:
- entry (though it's not explicitly labeled, it's the starting point)
- 3
- 11

And the edges are:
- entry -> 3
- 3 -> 3 (loop)
- 3 -> 11 (exit)

I think that's the structure. Now, I'll write the dot file accordingly.

To represent the control flow graph of the given IR code, we'll create a dot file that illustrates the basic blocks and their connections. Each node represents a basic block, and edges show possible control flow paths.

Here's the dot file:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    entry [label="entry"];
    node3 [label="3"];
    node11 [label="11"];

    entry -> node3;
    node3 -> node3 [label="loop"];
    node3 -> node11 [label="exit"];
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Nodes:** There are three nodes: `entry`, `3`, and `11`.
  - `entry` is the starting point of the function.
  - `3` is the loop body where the GCD calculation occurs.
  - `11` is the exit block where the function returns the result.
  
- **Edges:** 
  - The `entry` node connects to `node3`, indicating the start of execution.
  - `node3` has a loop edge back to itself, showing the iterative process of the GCD algorithm.
  - `node3` connects to `node11` when the loop exits, leading to the return statement.
