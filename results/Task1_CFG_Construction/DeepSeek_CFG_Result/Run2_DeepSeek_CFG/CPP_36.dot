Alright, I'm looking at the user's request. They provided an IR code and asked for a control flow graph in dot file format, showing just the node titles without the block content. 

First, I need to understand the IR code structure. The function is "_Z9fizz_buzzi" which suggests it's a FizzBuzz implementation. The code has several basic blocks labeled 1, 3, 5, 15, 24.

I'll identify each block and their connections. Block 1 starts the function, checks if the input is greater than 0, and branches to 5 or 3. 

Block 3 is the exit point, returning a value. It can be reached from block 24 or directly from 1 if the condition fails.

Block 5 is where the main logic begins. It has two phi nodes, meaning it can be reached from block 1 or 24. It checks divisibility by 11 and 13, then decides whether to loop or proceed.

Block 15 is a loop that processes each number, updating values and checking if it should continue looping or move to block 24.

Block 24 seems to handle the increment of the number and decides whether to loop back to 5 or exit to 3.

Next, I'll map the edges based on the branch instructions. Each block's possible paths are determined by the 'br' statements and their conditions.

Finally, I'll structure this into a dot file, ensuring each node is labeled correctly and edges represent the control flow. I'll make sure the graph is clear and concise, as per the user's instructions.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format, showing the basic blocks (nodes) and their connections (edges):

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"]
    3[label="3"]
    5[label="5"]
    15[label="15"]
    24[label="24"]

    1 -> 5 [label="true"]
    1 -> 3 [label="false"]

    5 -> 24 [label="true"]
    5 -> 15 [label="false"]

    15 -> 24 [label="true"]
    15 -> 15 [label="false"]

    24 -> 3 [label="true"]
    24 -> 5 [label="false"]
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between the basic blocks in the IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and edges represent the control flow between blocks. The labels on the edges indicate the condition under which control flows along that edge.
