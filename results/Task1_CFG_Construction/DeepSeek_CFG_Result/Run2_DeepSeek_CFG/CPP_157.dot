Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand what the IR code is doing. The function is called _Z20right_angle_trianglefff and it takes three float arguments. It seems to be checking some conditions based on these floats, probably to determine if they form a right-angled triangle or something similar.

Looking at the code, I see several basic blocks. Each block starts with a label like 3, 12, 18, etc. Each block ends with a branch instruction, which can be conditional or unconditional. My goal is to represent the flow between these blocks as nodes in a graph.

The first block is the entry point, label 3. It computes some values and then branches to either label 25 or 12 based on a comparison. So, node 3 has edges to node 12 and node 25.

Next, block 12 has its own computations and then branches to either 25 or 18. So, node 12 connects to node 18 and node 25.

Moving on, block 18 does more calculations and branches to 25 or 24. Thus, node 18 leads to node 24 and node 25.

Block 24 simply branches to 25 without any conditions, so node 24 has an edge only to node 25.

Finally, block 25 is where the function returns a boolean value based on the phi instruction, which selects a value from different incoming edges. This is the exit node.

Putting it all together, the nodes are 3, 12, 18, 24, and 25. The edges represent the possible flow of control between these nodes. I need to make sure each edge is correctly placed based on the branch instructions.

I think that's the basic structure. Now, I'll represent this as a dot file, showing each node and the edges between them without going into the details of each block's contents.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their control flow. Here's the structure:

- **Node 3**: The entry point, branches to Node 12 and Node 25.
- **Node 12**: Branches to Node 18 and Node 25.
- **Node 18**: Branches to Node 24 and Node 25.
- **Node 24**: Unconditionally branches to Node 25.
- **Node 25**: The exit point where the function returns.

The graph is represented in dot language as follows:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    label_3 [label="3"];
    label_12 [label="12"];
    label_18 [label="18"];
    label_24 [label="24"];
    label_25 [label="25"];
    
    label_3 -> label_12 [label="cond"];
    label_3 -> label_25 [label="cond"];
    
    label_12 -> label_18 [label="cond"];
    label_12 -> label_25 [label="cond"];
    
    label_18 -> label_24 [label="cond"];
    label_18 -> label_25 [label="cond"];
    
    label_24 -> label_25;
}
```

This dot file illustrates the control flow between the basic blocks of the function. Each node represents a basic block, and edges show possible control flow paths.
