Okay, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The output should be in dot file format, showing each basic block as a node and the edges representing control flow between them.

First, I'll look through the IR code to identify all the basic blocks. Each label in the code represents a basic block. The labels I see are 1, 11, 16, 20, 67, 71, 75, 77. So there are 8 basic blocks.

Next, I'll determine the control flow between these blocks by looking at the branch instructions. 

- Block 1 has a branch to block 11 if the condition is true, else to block 75.
- Block 11 has a branch to block 71 if the condition is true, else to block 16.
- Block 16 branches to block 20.
- Block 20 is a loop that branches back to itself if the loop condition isn't met, otherwise to block 67.
- Block 67 branches to block 71 if the condition is true, else to block 75.
- Block 71 is another loop that branches back to itself if the loop condition isn't met, otherwise to block 75.
- Block 75 is the exit block with a return instruction.
- Block 77 is part of the loop in block 71 and branches back to itself if the condition isn't met, otherwise to block 75.

I'll structure the nodes and edges based on these connections. Each node will be labeled with its block number, and edges will show the flow from one block to another.

Finally, I'll write the dot file with these nodes and edges, ensuring the correct syntax and structure for a CFG.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify each basic block by its label and determine the control flow edges between them. The CFG is represented in dot file format, with nodes as basic blocks and edges showing control flow.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: Each label in the IR code represents a basic block. The labels found are 1, 11, 16, 20, 67, 71, 75, and 77.

2. **Determine Control Flow**: 
   - Block 1 branches to block 11 if the condition is true, else to block 75.
   - Block 11 branches to block 71 if the condition is true, else to block 16.
   - Block 16 branches to block 20.
   - Block 20 is a loop that continues to itself until the loop condition is met, then it branches to block 67.
   - Block 67 branches to block 71 if the condition is true, else to block 75.
   - Block 71 is another loop that continues to itself until its condition is met, then it branches to block 75.
   - Block 75 is the exit block with a return instruction.
   - Block 77 is part of the loop in block 71, branching back to itself until the loop exits to block 75.

3. **Construct the CFG**: Using the identified blocks and their control flow, we construct the graph with nodes and directed edges.

### Control Flow Graph in Dot Format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    1 [label="1"];
    11 [label="11"];
    16 [label="16"];
    20 [label="20"];
    67 [label="67"];
    71 [label="71"];
    75 [label="75"];
    77 [label="77"];

    1 -> 11 [label="true"];
    1 -> 75 [label="false"];

    11 -> 71 [label="true"];
    11 -> 16 [label="false"];

    16 -> 20;

    20 -> 20 [label="loop continues"];
    20 -> 67 [label="loop exits"];

    67 -> 71 [label="true"];
    67 -> 75 [label="false"];

    71 -> 77 [label="loop continues"];
    77 -> 71 [label="loop continues"];
    71 -> 75 [label="loop exits"];

    75 -> 75 [label="ret"];
}
```

This dot file accurately represents the control flow graph of the provided IR code, showing all basic blocks and their respective control flow paths.
