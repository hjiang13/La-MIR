Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to generate a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand what a control flow graph is. From what I remember, a CFG is a graphical representation of the control flow of a program. Each node represents a basic block, which is a sequence of instructions without any branching. Edges between nodes represent possible flow of control from one block to another.

Looking at the provided IR code, it's in LLVM IR format. The function is `@_Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`, which I think is a C++ function that's been compiled. The function seems to be related to vectors, possibly performing some operations on them.

My task is to parse this IR code and identify all the basic blocks and their connections. Each basic block starts with a label, and ends at a branching instruction. The IR uses labels like `2`, `16`, `29`, etc., which are the basic blocks.

I'll start by listing all the labels I can find in the code. Scanning through, I see labels like 2, 16, 29, 31, 37, 38, 39, 48, 51, 53, 57, 60, 63, 65, 69, 81, 83, 85, 88, 90, 91. That's 21 labels, so 21 basic blocks.

Next, I need to determine how these blocks connect. I'll look for branch instructions. For example, after label 2, there's a `br i1 %15, label %16, label %91`. This means from block 2, if condition %15 is true, it goes to block 16, else to block 91.

I'll go through each block and note where each branch leads. For instance, block 16 ends with `br i1 %28, label %31, label %29`. So from 16, it can go to 31 or 29.

I'll repeat this process for each block, mapping each possible branch to its destination. Some blocks, like 38 and 90, have `unreachable` or `resume` instructions, which typically don't have outgoing edges except in error handling.

I also notice some landing pads (like 81, 83, 85) which are part of exception handling. These might connect to each other or to other blocks, but for simplicity, I'll include them as nodes without worrying about the specifics of exception flows unless necessary.

Once I have all the connections, I can represent them in a dot file. Each node is a basic block labeled with its number. Edges are drawn from each block to the blocks it can branch to.

I should also make sure that the dot file includes all nodes and edges without including the detailed instructions of each block, as per the user's request.

I think I've covered all the necessary blocks and their connections. Now, I'll structure this into a dot file, ensuring each node is represented and edges are correctly drawn based on the branches.

Here's the control flow graph represented as a dot file, showing the basic blocks and their connections:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    2 [label="2"];
    16 [label="16"];
    29 [label="29"];
    31 [label="31"];
    37 [label="37"];
    38 [label="38"];
    39 [label="39"];
    48 [label="48"];
    51 [label="51"];
    53 [label="53"];
    57 [label="57"];
    60 [label="60"];
    63 [label="63"];
    65 [label="65"];
    69 [label="69"];
    81 [label="81"];
    83 [label="83"];
    85 [label="85"];
    88 [label="88"];
    90 [label="90"];
    91 [label="91"];

    2 -> 16;
    2 -> 91;
    16 -> 29;
    16 -> 31;
    29 -> 69;
    31 -> 37;
    31 -> 39;
    37 -> 38;
    39 -> 48;
    39 -> 53;
    48 -> 51;
    51 -> 53;
    53 -> 57;
    53 -> 60;
    57 -> 60;
    60 -> 63;
    60 -> 65;
    63 -> 65;
    65 -> 69;
    69 -> 16;
    69 -> 91;
    81 -> 85;
    83 -> 85;
    85 -> 88;
    85 -> 90;
    88 -> 90;
    90 -> 85;
}
```

This graph shows each basic block as a node and the possible control flow paths as directed edges between these nodes. Each node is labeled with its corresponding block number, and edges represent the potential flow of execution between blocks based on the branching instructions in the IR code.
