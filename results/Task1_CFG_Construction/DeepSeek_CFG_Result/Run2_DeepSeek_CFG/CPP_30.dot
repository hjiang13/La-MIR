Okay, I need to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The user provided a function in LLVM IR, and my task is to represent the CFG as a dot file, showing nodes and edges without detailing the contents of each basic block. 

First, I should parse the IR code to identify all the basic blocks. Each label in the code represents a basic block, so I'll list them out. Looking through the code, I see labels like 2, 12, 22, 26, 32, 33, 34, 43, 46, 49, 54, 57, 60, 62, 66, 68, 70, 73, 75, 76, and 88. That's 21 labels, so 21 nodes in the CFG.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these nodes. This means figuring out where each basic block branches to. For example, after label 2, the code branches to label 88 or 12. So, node 2 has edges to node 88 and node 12.

I'll go through each label and note the possible branches. For instance, label 12 branches to itself, 76, or 22. Wait, that might not be right. Let me check the code again. After label 12, there's a br instruction to label 76 or 22, depending on the condition. So, node 12 connects to nodes 76 and 22.

I also need to handle cases where there are multiple predecessors. For example, label 76 is reached from 62, 24, and 12. So, node 76 will have incoming edges from those nodes.

I should be careful with loops and conditional branches. The loop instruction at the end of label 76 indicates a loop back to label 12, so there's an edge from 76 to 12.

Exception handling blocks like labels 66, 68, 70, 73, and 75 also need to be connected properly. These are part of the unwind paths and should point to each other as per the code.

Once all edges are mapped, I can structure them in the dot file. Each node will be a rectangle with the label number, and edges will be arrows showing the flow.

I think I have all the connections now. I'll write the dot file with nodes and edges as identified, making sure it's in the correct syntax so it can be visualized properly.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=rectangle, style=filled, color=lightblue];

    2 [label="2"];
    12 [label="12"];
    22 [label="22"];
    26 [label="26"];
    32 [label="32"];
    33 [label="33"];
    34 [label="34"];
    43 [label="43"];
    46 [label="46"];
    49 [label="49"];
    54 [label="54"];
    57 [label="57"];
    60 [label="60"];
    62 [label="62"];
    66 [label="66"];
    68 [label="68"];
    70 [label="70"];
    73 [label="73"];
    75 [label="75"];
    76 [label="76"];
    88 [label="88"];

    2 -> 88;
    2 -> 12;
    12 -> 76;
    12 -> 22;
    22 -> 26;
    22 -> 24;
    26 -> 32;
    26 -> 34;
    32 -> 33;
    34 -> 43;
    34 -> 49;
    43 -> 46;
    46 -> 49;
    49 -> 54;
    49 -> 57;
    54 -> 57;
    57 -> 60;
    57 -> 62;
    60 -> 62;
    62 -> 76;
    66 -> 70;
    68 -> 70;
    70 -> 75;
    73 -> 75;
    75 -> 70;
    76 -> 12;
    76 -> 88;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code, and edges represent control flow between blocks. You can visualize this graph using tools like Graphviz.
