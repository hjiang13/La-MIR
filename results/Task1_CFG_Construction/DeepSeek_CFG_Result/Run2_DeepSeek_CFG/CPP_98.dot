Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an IR (Intermediate Representation) code and wants a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. The CFG should include nodes and edges, with each node labeled by its basic block title.

First, I need to understand the structure of the provided IR code. It's written in LLVM IR, which I'm familiar with. The function in question is `_Z11count_upperNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, which seems to be a C++ function that counts uppercase letters in a string.

Looking at the IR code, I can see several basic blocks labeled with numbers like 1, 12, 26, 33, etc. Each block ends with a terminator instruction like `br`, which indicates control flow to another block.

My goal is to identify all the basic blocks and their connections. I'll start by listing each block and noting where each `br` instruction sends control.

1. **Block 1**: This is the entry block. It starts with some setup instructions and ends with a conditional branch to block 50 or 12. So, block 1 has edges to block 50 and block 12.

2. **Block 12**: This block is reached from block 1. It initializes some variables and loops into block 26. The loop continues until a condition is met to exit to block 50. So, block 12 goes to block 26.

3. **Block 26**: This is a loop block. It has several conditional checks and branches. Depending on the conditions, it can branch back to itself or to block 42. So, block 26 connects to itself and block 42.

4. **Blocks 33, 35, 37, 39**: These are part of the loop in block 26. Each has a condition that either branches back into the loop (to block 42) or continues to the next check. So, block 33 goes to block 42, block 35 to 42, and so on.

5. **Block 42**: This block seems to handle the loop's increment and condition check. It branches back to block 26 if the loop continues or exits to block 50 if it ends. So, block 42 connects back to block 26 and exits to block 50.

6. **Block 50**: This is the exit block where the function returns. It's reached from block 1 or block 42.

Putting this all together, I can outline the edges between the blocks. Each node is a basic block, and edges represent control flow.

I need to represent this in DOT language. Each node will be a simple label, and edges will be directed arrows. I'll structure it with a graph header, nodes, and edges.

I should double-check the connections to ensure all flows are correctly represented. For instance, making sure that block 26 can loop back to itself and also go to block 42, and that all conditional blocks correctly point to their destinations.

Finally, I'll format this into a DOT file, ensuring proper syntax with `digraph`, `node`, and `edge` definitions, and list all the edges as per the control flow.

Here's the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];
    
    1 [label="1"];
    12 [label="12"];
    26 [label="26"];
    33 [label="33"];
    35 [label="35"];
    37 [label="37"];
    39 [label="39"];
    42 [label="42"];
    50 [label="50"];
    
    edge [arrowhead=normal];
    
    1 -> 50 [label="cond"];
    1 -> 12 [label="cond"];
    
    12 -> 26 [label=""];
    
    26 -> 26 [label="loopback"];
    26 -> 42 [label=""];
    
    33 -> 42 [label="cond"];
    35 -> 42 [label="cond"];
    37 -> 42 [label="cond"];
    39 -> 42 [label="cond"];
    
    42 -> 26 [label="loop"];
    42 -> 50 [label="exit"];
    
    50 -> 1 [label="ret"];
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between the basic blocks of the given IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and edges represent control flow between blocks. The labels on edges indicate the type of control flow (e.g., "cond" for conditional branches, "loop" for loops, and "exit" for exits).
