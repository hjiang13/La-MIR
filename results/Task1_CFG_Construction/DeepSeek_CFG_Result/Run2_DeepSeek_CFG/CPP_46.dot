Okay, so the user has given me an IR code and wants me to generate a control flow graph in dot file format. They specified that I don't need to include the content of each basic block, just the titles of the nodes and the edges between them. 

First, I need to understand what the IR code is doing. It's a function called _Z4fib4i, which seems to be a Fibonacci function. The code has several basic blocks labeled from 1 to 38, but I notice that the labels go up to 38, but there's a 34 and then it jumps to 38 again. Wait, actually, looking at the code, the labels are 1, 6, 10, 14, 17, 23, 34, and 38. 

I should go through each block and note where the branches and jumps are pointing. Starting from block 1, it branches to either 34 or 6 based on the comparison. Then block 6 branches to 34 or 10. Block 10 has a branch to 17 or 14. Block 14 goes to 38. Block 17 has a branch to 34 or 23. Block 23 goes to 34. Block 38 has a branch back to itself or to 17. Block 34 is the exit point.

So, I'll map each block as a node and draw edges based on where each block jumps or branches to. I'll structure it in dot language, making sure to show all the connections accurately without including any unnecessary details about the block contents.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"]
    6[label="6"]
    10[label="10"]
    14[label="14"]
    17[label="17"]
    23[label="23"]
    34[label="34"]
    38[label="38"]

    1 -> 34[label="cond"]
    1 -> 6[label="cond"]

    6 -> 34[label="cond"]
    6 -> 10[label="cond"]

    10 -> 17[label="cond"]
    10 -> 14[label="cond"]

    14 -> 38[label=""]

    17 -> 34[label="cond"]
    17 -> 23[label="cond"]

    23 -> 34[label=""]

    38 -> 38[label="loop"]
    38 -> 17[label="cond"]
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph, where:
- Each node represents a basic block in the IR code
- Edges represent control flow between blocks
- Labels indicate the type of control flow (conditional or unconditional)

You can visualize this graph using any dot viewer or graph visualization tool.
