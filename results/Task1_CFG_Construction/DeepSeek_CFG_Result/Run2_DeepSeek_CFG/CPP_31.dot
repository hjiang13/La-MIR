Okay, so the user has provided an IR code and wants me to generate a control flow graph in dot file format. The user is an expert in high-performance computation, so they probably understand the importance of optimizing code, and analyzing the control flow can help with that. 

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. It's a function called _Z8is_primex which takes an i64 argument and returns an i1, so it's a boolean function checking if a number is prime. 

I need to identify each basic block. In the IR code, blocks are labeled with numbers like 1, 3, 5, 13, 15. Each block ends with a branch instruction, so I'll follow those to determine the edges between the nodes.

Starting from the entry point, the function begins at block 1. It checks if the input is less than 2 and branches to block 15 if true, else to block 3. So, node 1 has edges to 15 and 3.

Block 3 checks if the input is less than 4. If true, it goes to 15; else to 5. So node 3 connects to 15 and 5.

Block 5 is a loop. It has a phi node, calculates the remainder, checks if it's zero, increments the divisor, squares it, and checks if the square is greater than the input. Depending on that, it either goes to 13 or loops back to 5. So node 5 has edges to 13 and itself.

Block 13 does some computation and then branches to 15. So node 13 only connects to 15.

Finally, block 15 is the exit point where the return value is determined based on previous conditions. It has no outgoing edges.

Now, I'll structure this into a dot file. Each node is labeled with its block number, and edges show the control flow. I'll make sure it's clean and accurately represents the flow.

I think the user wants a clear and concise graph without the internal details of each block, just the structure. So, the dot file should only include the nodes and edges, nothing more. 

I should also make sure the graph is correct, so I'll double-check each branch and the corresponding edges. Once done, the user can visualize this graph to understand the control flow better, which might help in optimizing the code or analyzing its behavior.

I'll analyze the control flow graph of the given IR code and represent it in DOT file format. The nodes represent basic blocks, and the edges represent control flow between them.

Here is the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, label=""];
    
    1 [label="1"];
    3 [label="3"];
    5 [label="5"];
    13 [label="13"];
    15 [label="15"];
    
    1 -> 15 [label="br i1 %2, label %15"];
    1 -> 3 [label="br i1 %4, label %3"];
    
    3 -> 15 [label="br i1 %4, label %15"];
    3 -> 5 [label="br i1 %4, label %5"];
    
    5 -> 5 [label="br i1 %12, label %5"];  // Self-loop (back edge of the loop)
    5 -> 13 [label="br i1 %12, label %13"];
    
    13 -> 15 [label="br label %15"];
    
    15 [shape=ellipse, style=filled, color=red];  // Terminal node (exit)
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph with:
- Nodes labeled with their respective basic block numbers
- Edges representing control flow between blocks
- Node 15 as the terminal node (exit point of the function)

You can visualize this graph using tools like Graphviz.
