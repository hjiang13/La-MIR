Okay, so I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The function is `_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi`, which takes a vector and an integer. The output should be a dot file showing the nodes and edges without detailing the basic blocks.

First, I'll parse the IR code to identify all the labels, which represent basic blocks. Each label corresponds to a node in the CFG. Then, I'll determine the edges by looking at the branches (br) and jumps in the code. Each br instruction indicates a possible edge from one node to another.

I'll start by listing all the labels I see in the code: 2, 4, 9, 16, 18, 55, 62, 77, 83, 86, 88. Each of these will be a node in the graph.

Next, I'll trace the flow of the program. The function starts at label 2. From there, it branches to label 4 if %3 is true, otherwise to label 86. So there's an edge from 2 to 4 and from 2 to 86.

Then, in label 4, there's a branch to label 83 if %8 is true, else to label 9. So edges from 4 to 83 and 4 to 9.

In label 9, there's a branch to label 55 if %15 is true, else to label 16. So edges from 9 to 55 and 9 to 16.

Label 16 is a predecessor to label 18, so an edge from 16 to 18.

Label 18 is a loop, so it has edges pointing back to itself and to label 55. So edges from 18 to 18 and 18 to 55.

Label 55 has a branch to label 77 if %61 is true, else to label 62. So edges from 55 to 77 and 55 to 62.

Label 62 only goes to label 77, so an edge from 62 to 77.

Label 77 has a branch to label 86 if %82 is true, else to label 83. So edges from 77 to 86 and 77 to 83.

Label 83 is part of a loop with label 88. It goes to 88, which then loops back to itself or exits to 86. So edges from 83 to 88 and 88 to 86.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the dot file with each node and the edges based on the branches. I'll make sure to format it correctly with the dot syntax, using digraph, nodes, and edges appropriately.

Here's the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    2 [label="2"];
    4 [label="4"];
    9 [label="9"];
    16 [label="16"];
    18 [label="18"];
    55 [label="55"];
    62 [label="62"];
    77 [label="77"];
    83 [label="83"];
    86 [label="86"];
    88 [label="88"];

    2 -> 4;
    2 -> 86;

    4 -> 83;
    4 -> 9;

    9 -> 55;
    9 -> 16;

    16 -> 18;

    18 -> 18;
    18 -> 55;

    55 -> 77;
    55 -> 62;

    62 -> 77;

    77 -> 86;
    77 -> 83;

    83 -> 88;

    88 -> 86;
    88 -> 88;
}
```

This graph shows all the basic blocks (nodes) and their control flow edges. Each node represents a basic block labeled with its corresponding label from the IR code. The edges represent the possible control flow transitions between these blocks.
