Alright, I need to analyze the given IR code and construct a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. The user has provided the IR code for a function named `_Z17is_multiply_primei`, and my task is to identify the basic blocks and their connections.

First, I'll go through the IR code line by line to understand the structure. The function starts with some metadata, which I can ignore for the CFG. The function definition is `define dso_local zeroext i1 @_Z17is_multiply_primei(i32 %0)`, so it's a function that returns an `i1` (a boolean) and takes an `i32` argument.

Looking at the code, I can identify the basic blocks by their labels. Each block starts with a label followed by the instructions. I see labels like `3:`, `11:`, `14:`, and `23:`. These are the basic blocks in the function.

Next, I'll note the control flow between these blocks. Control flow is determined by `br` (branch) instructions. Each `br` instruction can have one or two targets, depending on whether it's conditional or unconditional.

Starting from the beginning:

1. The function starts with `%2 = icmp slt i32 %0, 4`, which compares the input with 4.
2. The first branch is `br i1 %2, label %11, label %3`. So, if `%2` is true, it goes to block `11`, else to block `3`.

So, the initial node is block `1` (though not explicitly named, it's the entry block). From block `1`, there are edges to block `11` and block `3`.

Now, examining block `3`:

3. The block has `phi` nodes for `%4`, `%5`, and `%6`, which indicates that it's a merge point for different incoming paths.
4. It computes `%7 = srem i32 %6, %4` (remainder of division).
5. Then `%8 = icmp eq i32 %7, 0` (checks if remainder is zero).
6. `%9 = icmp sgt i32 %6, %4` (checks if `%6` is greater than `%4`).
7. `%10 = and i1 %9, %8` (logical AND of the two conditions).
8. The branch `br i1 %10, label %14, label %23` means if `%10` is true, go to block `14`, else to block `23`.

So, from block `3`, there are edges to block `14` and block `23`.

Moving to block `11`:

9. `%12 = phi i32 [ 0, %1 ], [ %25, %23 ]` (merges values from different predecessors).
10. `%13 = icmp eq i32 %12, 2` (checks if `%12` equals 2).
11. `ret i1 %13` returns the boolean result.

So, block `11` is a terminal block, returning the result.

Next, block `14`:

12. `%15 = phi i32 [ %18, %14 ], [ %5, %3 ]` (merges values).
13. `%16 = phi i32 [ %17, %14 ], [ %6, %3 ]` (merges values).
14. `%17 = sdiv i32 %16, %4` (integer division).
15. `%18 = add nsw i32 %15, 1` (increments `%15`).
16. `%19 = srem i32 %17, %4` (remainder of division).
17. `%20 = icmp eq i32 %19, 0` (checks remainder).
18. `%21 = icmp sgt i32 %17, %4` (checks if `%17` is greater than `%4`).
19. `%22 = and i1 %21, %20` (logical AND).
20. The branch `br i1 %22, label %14, label %23` means if `%22` is true, loop back to block `14`, else go to block `23`.

So, from block `14`, there's a loop edge back to itself and an edge to block `23`.

Now, block `23`:

21. `%24 = phi i32 [ %6, %3 ], [ %17, %14 ]` (merges values from predecessors).
22. `%25 = phi i32 [ %5, %3 ], [ %18, %14 ]` (merges values).
23. `%26 = add nuw nsw i32 %4, 1` (increments `%4`).
24. `%27 = mul nsw i32 %26, %26` (squares `%26`).
25. `%28 = icmp sgt i32 %27, %24` (checks if `%27` is greater than `%24`).
26. The branch `br i1 %28, label %11, label %3` means if `%28` is true, go to block `11`, else back to block `3`.

So, from block `23`, there are edges to block `11` and back to block `3`.

Putting it all together, I can visualize the CFG with the following nodes and edges:

- Node 1 (entry) branches to Node 11 and Node 3.
- Node 3 branches to Node 14 and Node 23.
- Node 14 branches back to itself (loop) and to Node 23.
- Node 23 branches back to Node 3 and to Node 11.
- Node 11 is the exit node.

I need to represent this in DOT language. Each node is represented as a label, and edges are directed with arrows. Even though Node 1 isn't explicitly named in the IR, it's the entry point, so I'll include it.

Finally, I'll structure the DOT file with nodes and edges as per the above analysis.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format, showing the basic blocks as nodes and their connections:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    "1" [label="1", fillcolor="lightblue"];
    "3" [label="3", fillcolor="lightgray"];
    "11" [label="11", fillcolor="lightgray"];
    "14" [label="14", fillcolor="lightgray"];
    "23" [label="23", fillcolor="lightgray"];
    
    "1" -> "11";
    "1" -> "3";
    
    "3" -> "14";
    "3" -> "23";
    
    "14" -> "14";
    "14" -> "23";
    
    "23" -> "3";
    "23" -> "11";
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph with nodes labeled according to their basic blocks and directed edges showing the flow between them.
