Alright, let's see. The user provided an IR code and wants a control flow graph in DOT format. They mentioned not to include the content of each basic block, just the node titles.

First, I'll parse the IR code to identify the basic blocks. Each label in the code represents a basic block. So, I'll go through the code and note down all the labels.

Looking at the code, I see several labels: 1, 11, 15, 19, 25, 27. There's also a function entry point, which I'll label as 'start'. Each of these labels is a node in the CFG.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these nodes. That means figuring out how control flows from one block to another. For example, after the entry, it goes to block 1. Then, from block 1, it checks some condition and branches to either 27 or 11.

I'll map out each branch and loop. There's a loop between blocks 15 and 19. So, I'll draw edges accordingly, making sure to represent the loop structure.

Once all edges are mapped, I'll structure the DOT file with nodes representing each basic block and edges showing the control flow.

I should double-check to ensure all blocks are included and edges are correctly placed. Then, I'll format it into the DOT language as specified.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];

    start[label="Entry"];
    1[label="1"];
    11[label="11"];
    15[label="15"];
    19[label="19"];
    25[label="25"];
    27[label="27"];

    start -> 1;
    1 -> 27;
    1 -> 11;

    11 -> 15;
    11 -> 27;

    15 -> 19;
    15 -> 25;

    19 -> 15;
    19 -> 25;

    25 -> 27;
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph with nodes labeled by their basic block numbers and edges representing control flow between blocks. You can visualize this graph using tools like `dot` from Graphviz.
