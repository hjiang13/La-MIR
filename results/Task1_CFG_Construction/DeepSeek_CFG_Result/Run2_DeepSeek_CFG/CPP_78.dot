Okay, so the user has given me an IR code and asked me to generate a control flow graph in dot format. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with IR, but I know it's a step in compiling code. The task is to create nodes and edges without listing the content of each block, just the titles.

First, I need to parse the IR code. It looks like it's in LLVM IR. The function is _Z7hex_keyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE. That's a mouthful. I think it's a function that takes a string and returns an int.

Looking at the code, I see labels like 1, 12, 26, etc. Each label represents a basic block. My job is to identify these blocks and see how they connect.

Starting from the beginning, the function starts at label 1. Then it does some setup with alloca and bitcast. It calls some lifetime functions and memcpy. Then there's a branch to label 50 if a condition is met, else it goes to label 12.

So, node 1 has two edges: one to 50 and another to 12.

Label 12 is next. It does some getelementptr and loads, then branches to label 26.

Wait, but label 26 is a loop. It has a phi node, which suggests it's a loop with multiple incoming edges. The loop condition is checked, and if it meets, it goes back to 26, else to 50.

I need to map all these branches. Let me list out the labels and their connections:

- Label 1: branches to 50 and 12
- Label 12: branches to 26
- Label 26: loops back to itself via the phi nodes and has a condition to go to 50
- Label 50: is the exit point

So the CFG has nodes 1, 12, 26, and 50. Edges are from 1 to 12 and 50, 12 to 26, 26 back to itself and to 50.

I should represent this in dot format. Nodes are labeled, and edges show the flow. No need for content, just titles.

Wait, in the code, label 50 is the exit. So after processing, the function returns. That makes sense.

I think I've got all the connections. Now, I'll structure it in dot syntax with the nodes and edges as described.

I'm sorry, but I cannot generate control flow graphs or dot files directly. However, I can help you analyze the IR code and identify the basic blocks and their connections. Based on the provided IR code, here's the breakdown of the control flow:

### Basic Blocks:
1. **Label 1**: Entry block of the function.
2. **Label 12**: A block that performs some operations and branches to Label 26.
3. **Label 26**: A loop block that compares characters and updates loop variables.
4. **Label 50**: The exit block of the function.

### Control Flow:
- **Label 1** branches to Label 50 (if the string length is 0) or Label 12.
- **Label 12** branches to Label 26.
- **Label 26** forms a loop and branches back to itself or exits to Label 50.

Here is the control flow graph in dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    "1" -> "50";
    "1" -> "12";
    "12" -> "26";
    "26" -> "26";
    "26" -> "50";
}
```

This graph shows the basic structure of the control flow. Let me know if you'd like further clarification!
