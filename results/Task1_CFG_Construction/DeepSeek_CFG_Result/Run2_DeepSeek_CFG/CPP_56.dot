Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that a CFG represents the flow of a program's execution, with nodes as basic blocks and edges as jumps between them. Each basic block contains a sequence of instructions that are executed in order without any control flow changes except at the end.

Looking at the IR code, I see it's in LLVM format. The function is `_Z18correct_bracketing...` which seems to be a function that checks bracketing in a string. The code has labels like 1, 5, 8, 10, 23, 25, which are the basic blocks.

I'll list each label as a node. Now, I need to determine the edges between these nodes based on the branch instructions.

Starting from label 1, the first instruction is a `br` to label 25 if `%4` is true, else to label 5. So, node 1 has edges to 25 and 5.

Next, label 5 starts a loop. It has a `br` to label 10, so node 5 points to 10.

Label 10 is a loop body. It has a `br` to label 8 if some condition, else continues the loop. Wait, looking closer, label 10 is a phi node, so it's the start of the loop. The `br` at the end goes back to label 8, which is part of the loop.

Wait, no, label 8 is inside the loop. Let me see: label 8 has a `br` to label 23 if `%9` is true, else back to label 10. So node 8 has edges to 23 and 10.

Label 23 then branches to 25 based on `%24`. So node 23 points to 25.

Label 10, after some computations, has a `br` to label 25 if `%21` is true, else back to label 8. So node 10 has edges to 25 and 8.

Finally, label 25 is the exit point, returning a value.

Putting it all together:

- Node 1 branches to 25 and 5.
- Node 5 goes to 10.
- Node 10 goes to 25 and 8.
- Node 8 goes to 23 and 10.
- Node 23 goes to 25.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I might have missed that node 10 can loop back to itself via node 8. Also, node 25 is the termination point.

I think that's the basic structure. I'll represent this in a dot file with nodes and edges as described.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their control flow transitions. Here's the structured representation:

### Control Flow Graph (CFG)

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    "1" [label="1"];
    "5" [label="5"];
    "8" [label="8"];
    "10" [label="10"];
    "23" [label="23"];
    "25" [label="25"];

    "1" -> "25" [label="cond"];
    "1" -> "5" [label="cond"];

    "5" -> "10";

    "10" -> "25" [label="cond"];
    "10" -> "8" [label=""];

    "8" -> "23" [label="cond"];
    "8" -> "10" [label=""];

    "23" -> "25";
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the IR code, labeled as per their appearance in the code (1, 5, 8, 10, 23, 25).

2. **Edges**: Edges represent control flow between blocks.
   - Block 1 branches to 25 and 5 based on a condition.
   - Block 5 proceeds to block 10.
   - Block 10 may exit to 25 or loop back via block 8.
   - Block 8 checks a condition to either proceed to 23 or continue the loop.
   - Block 23 exits to 25.

This graph visualizes the program's execution flow, showing how control moves between different code segments.
