Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I remember that a CFG represents the flow of control through a program, showing the different basic blocks and how they connect via branches or jumps. 

First, I'll need to parse the IR code to identify the different labels and their corresponding basic blocks. Each label in the code marks the beginning of a new basic block. So, I'll go through the code and list out all the labels I see.

Looking at the code, I see labels like 2, 11, 14, 28, 35, 40, 42, 47, and so on. Each of these represents a node in the CFG. My next step is to understand how these nodes are connected. I'll look for branch instructions like 'br' which transfer control from one block to another.

For example, the code starts with 'br i1 %10, label %14, label %11'. This means that after the initial block (implicitly label 2), there's a conditional branch: if %10 is true, it goes to label 14; otherwise, it goes to label 11. So, in the CFG, node 2 will have edges to nodes 14 and 11.

Continuing this process, I'll examine each branch instruction to map out all the connections between the blocks. I'll also note any loops or repeated connections, like the loop involving labels 28 and 47. This loop continues until a certain condition is met, indicated by the 'br' instruction with a loop identifier.

I'm making sure not to include any detailed instructions within the nodes, as the user only wants the titles. Once all edges are mapped out, I'll structure the graph using dot language, ensuring each node is correctly connected based on the control flow.

I might make a mistake in identifying all the labels or misinterpreting the branch conditions, so I'll double-check each connection to ensure accuracy. Also, I'll verify that all possible paths are included, especially in more complex structures like loops and conditional branches.

Finally, I'll present the CFG in a clear dot format, making sure it's readable and accurately represents the control flow of the provided IR code.

Here is the control flow graph in dot format, showing the nodes (basic blocks) and edges (control flow):

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    2 [label="2"];
    11 [label="11"];
    14 [label="14"];
    28 [label="28"];
    35 [label="35"];
    40 [label="40"];
    42 [label="42"];
    47 [label="47"];

    2 -> 14 [label="cond"];
    2 -> 11 [label="cond"];

    11 -> 28;
    
    14 -> 14 [label="loop"];
    14 -> 28;

    28 -> 35;
    28 -> 40;
    28 -> 42;

    35 -> 47;
    40 -> 47;
    42 -> 47;

    47 -> 28 [label="loop"];
    47 -> 14 [label="loop"];
}
```

This graph shows the basic blocks and their control flow connections. The edges represent possible control flow transitions between blocks. The graph includes loops and conditional branches as present in the code.
