Alright, so I need to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code. I remember that a CFG represents the flow of control through a program, showing the sequence of basic blocks and how they connect via branches.

First, I'll look through the IR code to identify the basic blocks. Each basic block starts with a label, like `2:`, `11:`, `15:`, etc. These labels are followed by a series of instructions until the next label or a branching instruction.

Next, I'll note the branching points. The `br` instruction is used to transfer control to another block. For example, in the code, there's `br i1 %10, label %69, label %11`. This means that if condition `%10` is true, the program jumps to label `69`, otherwise it goes to `11`.

I'll also look for loops. Loops are indicated by the presence of `br` instructions that can loop back to a previous label. For instance, in the code, there's a loop that starts around label `24` and continues until it branches back to itself.

Now, I'll map out each block and its possible successors. Starting from the entry point, which is the first label after the function definition, I'll follow each branch and record the connections.

I'll also make sure to include any labels that are targets of jumps or returns. For example, the `ret void` instruction ends the function, so any block leading to it should point to an exit node.

Finally, I'll structure all these connections into a dot file format, showing each node as a basic block and edges representing the control flow between them.

Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    2 [label="2"];
    11 [label="11"];
    15 [label="15"];
    22 [label="22"];
    24 [label="24"];
    51 [label="51"];
    54 [label="54"];
    65 [label="65"];
    67 [label="67"];
    69 [label="69"];
    76 [label="76"];

    2 -> 11;
    11 -> 15;
    15 -> 22;
    22 -> 24;
    24 -> 51 [label="back edge"];
    24 -> 24 [label="loop"];
    51 -> 65;
    51 -> 54;
    54 -> 65;
    65 -> 67;
    65 -> 69;
    67 -> 76;
    76 -> 69 [label="back edge"];
    76 -> 76 [label="loop"];
    69 -> 2 [label="exit"];
}
```

This graph shows the basic blocks and their control flow connections. Each node represents a basic block, and edges represent control flow between blocks. The graph includes loops and conditional branches as present in the original IR code.
