Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user has provided an IR (Intermediate Representation) code and wants me to generate a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT file format. The CFG should include nodes representing basic blocks and edges showing the control flow between them. They don't need the contents of each block, just the titles.

First, I need to understand the structure of the provided IR code. It looks like it's in LLVM IR format. The function in question is `_Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which seems to be a C++ function that likely computes a rolling maximum on a vector.

To create the CFG, I'll go through the IR code and identify each basic block. Basic blocks are sequences of instructions that are executed in order, ending with a control flow instruction like `br`, `invoke`, or `ret`.

I'll start from the beginning of the function and follow each control flow instruction to map out the blocks and their connections. Each label in the IR (like `12`, `13`, etc.) represents a basic block.

Let me list out the labels I see in the code:

- 12
- 13
- 26
- 28
- 34
- 35
- 36
- 45
- 48
- 50
- 54
- 57
- 60
- 62
- 66
- 78
- 80
- 82
- 85
- 87

Each of these will be a node in the CFG. Next, I'll determine the edges by looking at where each `br`, `invoke`, or `ret` instruction points.

For example, the first branch is after the initial setup:

`br i1 %11, label %12, label %13`

This means block 2 branches to block 12 or 13 based on the condition in %11.

Continuing this process, I'll map each block's successors and predecessors. I'll also note any loops or exception handling blocks, which might have more complex control flows, especially with `invoke` and landing pads.

Once all edges are mapped, I'll structure the DOT file with nodes and edges, using the label numbers as node identifiers and adding directed edges based on the control flow.

I need to be careful with exception handling blocks (like 78, 80, 82, etc.), as they might have different control flow behaviors, including resuming after an exception.

Finally, I'll assemble all this information into the DOT format, ensuring that each node is represented and edges correctly show the flow between blocks.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    2 [label="2"];
    12 [label="12"];
    13 [label="13"];
    26 [label="26"];
    28 [label="28"];
    34 [label="34"];
    35 [label="35"];
    36 [label="36"];
    45 [label="45"];
    48 [label="48"];
    50 [label="50"];
    54 [label="54"];
    57 [label="57"];
    60 [label="60"];
    62 [label="62"];
    66 [label="66"];
    78 [label="78"];
    80 [label="80"];
    82 [label="82"];
    85 [label="85"];
    87 [label="87"];
    
    2 -> 12;
    2 -> 13;
    
    13 -> 26;
    13 -> 28;
    
    26 -> 66;
    
    28 -> 34;
    28 -> 36;
    
    34 -> 35;
    
    35 -> 35;
    
    36 -> 45;
    36 -> 50;
    
    45 -> 48;
    
    48 -> 50;
    
    50 -> 54;
    50 -> 57;
    
    54 -> 57;
    
    57 -> 60;
    57 -> 62;
    
    60 -> 62;
    
    62 -> 66;
    
    66 -> 13;
    66 -> 12;
    
    78 -> 82;
    
    80 -> 82;
    
    82 -> 85;
    82 -> 87;
    
    85 -> 87;
    
    87 -> 87;
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph of the IR code, with nodes as basic blocks and edges representing control flow between blocks. Each node is labeled with its corresponding block number. You can visualize this graph using tools like Graphviz.
