Alright, so I need to help the user by generating a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code. The user wants the output in dot file format, showing the nodes and edges without listing the contents of each basic block. Just the titles are needed.

First, I'll start by understanding the structure of the given IR code. It's in LLVM IR format, and the function of interest is `_Z18has_close_elementsSt6vectorIfSaIfEEf`. The function seems to check if a vector has close elements based on a given threshold.

I'll go through the code block by block, identifying each label and the corresponding instructions. Each label represents a basic block in the CFG. My goal is to map how these blocks connect to each other through branches.

Looking at the code, I see several labels: 2 is the entry block, then there's a branch to label 36 if a condition is met. If not, it proceeds to label 12. From 12, it goes to 17, which has a loop structure. Within the loop, there are more branches and labels like 14, 17 again, 23, 26, 28, and finally 36 as the exit.

I'll note down each block and the possible branches from it. For example, block 2 branches to 36 or 12. Block 12 goes to 17. Block 17 has a phi node, indicating it's a loop header, and it branches to 23 if a condition is true, otherwise back to 14. And so on.

I need to make sure I capture all the edges correctly. Each block should point to the blocks it can jump to. For instance, block 28 can go back to 26 or proceed to 36.

Once I've mapped all the connections, I'll structure them in the dot language format. Each node will be a basic block, and directed edges will represent the control flow between them.

I should double-check to ensure there are no missing edges or blocks. It's important to accurately represent the flow, especially around loops and conditional branches, to ensure the CFG is correct.

Finally, I'll present the dot code, making sure it's clean and correctly formatted so the user can visualize the CFG without issues.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    2[label="2: entry block"];
    12[label="12"];
    14[label="14"];
    17[label="17"];
    23[label="23"];
    26[label="26"];
    28[label="28"];
    36[label="36: exit block"];
    
    2 -> 36[label="br i1 %11, label %36, label %12"];
    2 -> 12[label="br i1 %11, label %36, label %12"];
    
    12 -> 17[label="br label %17"];
    
    17 -> 23[label="br i1 %22, label %23, label %14"];
    17 -> 14[label="br i1 %22, label %23, label %14"];
    
    23 -> 28[label="br label %28"];
    
    26 -> 28[label="br i1 %27, label %28, label %14"];
    26 -> 14[label="br i1 %27, label %28, label %14"];
    
    28 -> 36[label="br i1 %34, label %36, label %26"];
    28 -> 26[label="br i1 %34, label %36, label %26"];
    
    14 -> 17[label="br i1 %16, label %36, label %17, !llvm.loop !9"];
    14 -> 36[label="br i1 %16, label %36, label %17, !llvm.loop !9"];
}
```

This dot file shows the control flow graph with nodes representing basic blocks and edges representing control flow between blocks. Each node is labeled with its corresponding basic block label. The edges are labeled with the branch conditions that control the flow between blocks.
