Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user provided some IR code and wants me to generate a control flow graph in dot format. The nodes should just have titles, no need for the content of each basic block. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the given IR code. It's in LLVM IR format. I remember that in IR, the code is divided into basic blocks, each ending with a terminator instruction like 'br', 'ret', etc. So, I should identify these basic blocks and their labels.

Looking at the code, I see that it's a function named @_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. It takes a vector as an argument. The function starts with some getelementptr and load instructions, which are memory accesses. Then there are some computations and a branch instruction.

I need to parse through the code and identify each basic block. Each block starts with a label, like '12:', '14:', etc. The function has two main blocks: the entry block and the loop block. 

The entry block starts at the beginning and goes until the first 'br' instruction. It calculates some values and then branches based on a condition. The condition checks if %10 is equal to 0. If true, it goes to label 12, else to 14.

Label 12 is the exit block where the function returns a value. Label 14 is where the loop starts. Inside this loop, there are phi nodes which indicate that values are being carried over from the previous iteration. There are some load operations, comparisons, and then another branch instruction that either continues the loop or exits it.

I should map out the edges between these blocks. The entry block branches to either 12 or 14. Block 14 has a loop that can go back to itself or proceed to 12. So, the edges are Entry -> 12, Entry -> 14, 14 -> 14, and 14 -> 12.

I think that's all the basic blocks. Now, I need to represent this in dot format. Each node will be a label, and edges will show the flow between them. I'll make sure to use the correct syntax for dot files, like defining nodes with labels and connecting them with arrows.

I should double-check to ensure I didn't miss any blocks or edges. Looking back, the function only has three blocks: the entry, the loop, and the return. So, the graph should have three nodes with the appropriate edges.

Yeah, I think that's it. Now I can write the dot file accordingly.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Node12 [label="12"];
    Node14 [label="14"];

    Entry -> Node12 [label="cond"];
    Entry -> Node14 [label="cond"];
    Node14 -> Node14 [label="loop"];
    Node14 -> Node12 [label="exit"];
}
```

This graph shows three nodes and the edges between them. The nodes represent the basic blocks in the IR code, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks. The labels on the edges indicate whether the flow is conditional, part of a loop, or an exit.
