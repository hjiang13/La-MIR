Okay, so I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The IR code is in LLVM format, and the function is named @_Z6fibfibi, which I think is a Fibonacci function. Let me try to understand the structure of this code.

First, I'll look for the basic blocks, which are sections of code that are executed sequentially without any branches. Each basic block is labeled with a number, like 1, 8, 13, etc. The CFG will have nodes representing these blocks and edges representing the control flow between them.

Looking at the code, the function starts with block 1, which does some initializations. Then there's a branch (br) instruction that goes to either block 31 or block 8 based on whether %0 is less than 3. So, block 1 has two outgoing edges: one to block 31 and another to block 8.

Block 8 seems to handle the case where %0 is 3 or more. It increments %0 by 1, checks if it equals 4, and then either goes to block 31 or continues to block 13. So block 8 has two edges: to 31 and to 13.

Block 13 is a bit more complex. It checks if %9 is 5, which I think is %0 + 1. Depending on that, it goes to block 19 or block 16. So block 13 has two edges: to 19 and 16.

Block 16 seems to be preparing for some loop. It does some arithmetic and then branches to block 35. So block 16 has one edge to 35.

Block 35 is a loop. It has a phi node, which indicates that it's a merge point for multiple incoming edges. It performs some calculations, updates variables, and then checks if it should loop again or exit. It has a branch to either block 19 or back to itself. So block 35 has two edges: one to 19 and one looping back to 35.

Block 19 is another merge point with phi nodes. It checks if %14 is zero, which I think is a loop condition. If true, it goes to block 31; otherwise, it continues to block 25. So block 19 has two edges: to 31 and 25.

Block 25 is where the Fibonacci calculation happens. It loads values from the array, adds them, stores the result, and then branches to block 31. So block 25 has one edge to 31.

Block 31 is the exit block. It loads the final result and returns. So it's a terminal node with no outgoing edges.

Putting it all together, the CFG starts at block 1, splits to 31 and 8, then from 8 to 31 or 13, from 13 to 19 or 16, and so on, ultimately merging back to 31. The loop is between 35 and itself, and from 35 back to 19.

I think I've identified all the blocks and their connections. Now I'll represent this as a dot file, showing each node and their edges without the detailed contents of each block.

Here's the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code represented as a dot file. Each node represents a basic block, and edges show the control flow between them.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled, color=lightblue];

    1[label="1"];
    8[label="8"];
    13[label="13"];
    16[label="16"];
    19[label="19"];
    25[label="25"];
    31[label="31"];
    35[label="35"];

    1 -> 31;
    1 -> 8;

    8 -> 31;
    8 -> 13;

    13 -> 19;
    13 -> 16;

    16 -> 35;

    35 -> 19;
    35 -> 35;

    19 -> 31;
    19 -> 25;

    25 -> 31;
}
```

This graph starts at block 1, which branches to either block 31 or 8. Block 8 then branches to 31 or 13, leading to further branching. The loop is evident between blocks 35 and 19, with eventual termination at block 31. Each node is labeled with its corresponding block number, and edges represent the control flow paths.
