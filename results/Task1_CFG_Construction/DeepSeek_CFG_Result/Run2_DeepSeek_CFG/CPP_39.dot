Okay, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The user wants the output in dot file format, showing nodes and edges without listing the content of each basic blockâ€”just the titles.

First, I'll parse the IR code to identify the basic blocks. Each block is labeled with a number, like %1, %2, etc. I'll start by listing all the labels I find in the code.

Looking at the code, the function @_Z9prime_fibi has several labels: %1, %2, %9, %17, %19, and %24. So these are the nodes in my CFG.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these nodes. I'll look for branch instructions, like 'br', 'tail call', and 'ret' to see where each block jumps to.

Starting with %1: It seems to branch to %2 because of 'br label %2'.

In %2, there's a 'br' instruction that goes to %19 if a condition is true, else to %9. So, edges from %2 to %19 and %2 to %9.

In %9, the 'br' instruction at the end decides whether to loop back to %9 or go to %17. So, edges from %9 to itself and to %17.

From %17, it branches to %19, so an edge from %17 to %19.

In %19, the 'br' instruction goes back to %2 or to %24. So edges from %19 to %2 and %19 to %24.

Finally, %24 is the return block, so it doesn't have any outgoing edges.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the nodes and edges accordingly in the dot file format.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph cfg {
    node[shape=box];
    
    1[label="1"];
    2[label="2"];
    9[label="9"];
    17[label="17"];
    19[label="19"];
    24[label="24"];
    
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 19;
    2 -> 9;
    9 -> 9;
    9 -> 17;
    17 -> 19;
    19 -> 2;
    19 -> 24;
}
```

This CFG shows the basic blocks and their control flow. Each node represents a basic block labeled with its identifier, and edges represent control flow between blocks.
