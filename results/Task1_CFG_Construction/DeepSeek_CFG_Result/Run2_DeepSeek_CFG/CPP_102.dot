Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an IR code and wants a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. They mentioned that each node should just show the title of the basic block without listing the content.

First, I need to understand the structure of the given IR code. It defines a function `_Z10choose_numii` with several basic blocks labeled 2, 4, 9, 12, and others. Each block ends with a branch instruction that determines the next block to execute.

I'll start by identifying each basic block. The function begins at block 2, which isn't labeled but is the entry point. From there, it jumps to block 2, which is the starting point. The first instruction is an ICMP comparing %1 and %0, and then a branch to either block 12 or 4 based on the result.

Next, block 4 has its own ICMP and some computations, leading to another branch to either block 12 or 9. Block 9 performs some more operations and then branches to block 12. Finally, block 12 is where the function returns, using a PHI node to determine the return value based on which block it came from.

Now, I'll map out the edges between these blocks. Block 2 branches to itself (though that might be a typo, perhaps it's a loop or an error), block 12, and block 4. Block 4 then goes to block 12 or 9. Block 9 goes to 12, and block 12 is the exit point.

I should represent each block as a node in the DOT file with their labels. Then, connect them with directed edges according to the branches. I'll make sure the graph is clear and concise, focusing only on the titles without including the internal instructions.

I might have made a mistake in interpreting the initial block labels since block 2 seems to branch to itself, which doesn't make sense in a CFG. Perhaps it's a typo, and it should branch to another block. But based on the given code, I'll proceed as is.

Finally, I'll structure the DOT code with nodes for each block and edges showing the control flow. This should provide a clear visual representation of how the function executes based on the IR provided.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];
    
    start [label="2"];
    node2 [label="4"];
    node9 [label="9"];
    node12 [label="12"];
    
    start -> node2 [label="br %3, label %12, label %4"];
    node2 -> node12 [label="br i1 %8, label %12"];
    node2 -> node4 [label="br i1 %8, label %4"];
    node4 -> node9 [label="br label %12"];
    node9 -> node12 [label="br label %12"];
    node12 -> ret [label="ret i32 %13"];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with nodes and edges:

- Nodes represent basic blocks (labeled with their block numbers)
- Edges represent control flow between blocks

You can visualize this graph using any graph visualization tool that supports dot files.
