Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that a CFG represents the flow of a program's execution, showing the different paths the code can take. Each node in the graph is a basic block, which is a sequence of instructions without any control flow changes. Edges between nodes represent possible control flow transfers, like jumps or branches.

Looking at the provided IR code, I see it's in LLVM IR format. The function is named `@_Z9monotonicSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` and takes a vector as input. I need to identify the basic blocks and their connections.

I'll start by identifying the labels in the code. Each label marks the beginning of a new basic block. Let's list them out:

- The entry block is implicitly the first one, labeled `%1`.
- Then there's block `%11`.
- Block `%17`.
- Block `%19`.
- Block `%27`.
- Block `%42`.
- Block `%47`.

Wait, I think I might have missed some. Let me go through the code again.

The code starts at the top with `define dso_local...`, which is the entry point, so that's block `%1`. Then, after some computations, it branches to either `%11` or `%42` based on the result of `%10 = icmp ugt i64 %9, 1`. So, block `%1` has two outgoing edges: one to `%11` and another to `%42`.

Next, block `%11` starts after the first branch. It does some loads and computations, then another branch to either `%19` or `%17` based on `%16 = icmp ult i64 %14, 3`. So, from `%11`, there are two edges: to `%19` and `%17`.

Block `%17` seems to handle the case where the condition in `%11` is false. It computes `%18 = and i64 %13, -4` and then branches to `%47`. So, from `%17` to `%47`.

Block `%19` is a bit more complex. It has several phi nodes, indicating that it's a merge point for multiple incoming edges. It seems to handle a loop, checking some conditions and branching back to itself or to `%27` or `%42`.

Wait, looking at the code, block `%19` has a phi node for `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23`, `%24`, `%25`. These phi nodes suggest that `%19` can be reached from multiple predecessors, possibly from `%11` and `%47`.

Then, block `%19` checks if `%15` is zero with `%26 = icmp eq i64 %15, 0`, branching to `%42` if true, else to `%27`. So from `%19`, edges go to `%42` and `%27`.

Block `%27` is another loop, with phi nodes indicating it can be reached from itself (a loop) or from `%19`. It performs some floating-point comparisons and updates some variables, then checks `%41 = icmp eq i64 %40, 0`, branching back to `%27` if not zero, else to `%42`. So, from `%27`, edges to itself and `%42`.

Block `%42` is the exit block. It computes `%45 = add nsw i32 %44, %43` and then returns `%46 = icmp ne i32 %45, 2`. So, `%42` is a terminal block.

Block `%47` is another loop. It has phi nodes, suggesting it can be reached from `%17` and itself. It does several load and compare operations, then checks `%82 = icmp eq i64 %81, 0`, branching back to `%47` if not zero, else to `%19`. So, from `%47`, edges to itself and `%19`.

Putting this all together, the CFG will have nodes for each block and edges based on the branches. Now, I'll represent this as a dot file, showing each node and the edges between them without detailing the block contents.

Here is the control flow graph in dot format, representing the basic blocks and their connections:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    1 [label="1"];
    11 [label="11"];
    17 [label="17"];
    19 [label="19"];
    27 [label="27"];
    42 [label="42"];
    47 [label="47"];

    1 -> 11 [label="true"];
    1 -> 42 [label="false"];

    11 -> 19 [label="false"];
    11 -> 17 [label="true"];

    17 -> 47;

    19 -> 27 [label="false"];
    19 -> 42 [label="true"];

    27 -> 27 [label="true"];
    27 -> 42 [label="false"];

    47 -> 47 [label="true"];
    47 -> 19 [label="false"];
}
```

This graph illustrates the control flow of the given IR code, showing how each basic block connects based on conditional branches and loops.
