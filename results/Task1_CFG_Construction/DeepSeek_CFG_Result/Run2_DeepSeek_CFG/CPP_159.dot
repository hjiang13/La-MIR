Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I remember that a CFG represents the flow of a program's execution, showing the different paths the code can take. Each node in the graph is a basic block, which is a sequence of instructions without any branches or jumps. Edges between nodes represent possible control flow between these blocks.

Looking at the IR code, I see that it's a function named @_Z3eatiii, which takes a vector and three integers as arguments. The function has several labels: 4, 8, 15, and 23. Each label marks the beginning of a basic block. I need to identify these blocks and determine how they connect.

Starting from the entry point, which is label 4, I see an icmp instruction that compares %3 and %2. This will produce a boolean result, which is stored in %5. Then there's a bitcast and a memset call. After that, there's a call to allocate memory, and then a branch instruction that uses the result of %5 to decide whether to go to label 8 or label 15. So, from label 4, there are two possible paths: one to label 8 and another to label 15.

Next, looking at label 8, it seems to handle the case where %5 was true. It performs some arithmetic operations, casts, and stores. It ends with a branch to label 23. So label 8 only goes to label 23.

Label 15 handles the case where %5 was false. It also does some arithmetic, casting, and storing, then branches to label 23. So label 15 only goes to label 23 as well.

Label 23 is where both paths from 8 and 15 merge. It uses phi instructions to select values based on which predecessor block it came from. After some more operations, it returns void, which means this is the exit point of the function.

Putting this all together, the CFG starts at label 4, which branches to either 8 or 15. Both 8 and 15 then branch to 23, which is the final node before exiting.

I should represent this as a dot file with nodes for each label and edges showing the flow between them. Each node will be labeled with its name, and edges will show the direction of control flow without needing to list the instructions inside each block.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify each basic block by its label and determine the control flow between them. The graph starts at the entry block (label 4), which branches to either block 8 or 15 based on a condition. Both blocks 8 and 15 then flow into block 23, which is the merge point before the function returns.

Here is the CFG in dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    label4 [label="4"];
    label8 [label="8"];
    label15 [label="15"];
    label23 [label="23"];
    
    label4 -> label8;
    label4 -> label15;
    label8 -> label23;
    label15 -> label23;
}
```

This graph shows the basic blocks and the possible control flow paths between them.
