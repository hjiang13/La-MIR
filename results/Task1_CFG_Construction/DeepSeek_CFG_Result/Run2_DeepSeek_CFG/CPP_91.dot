Okay, so the user has provided an IR code and wants me to generate a control flow graph (CFG) in dot format, showing the nodes and edges without detailing the basic blocks. Let me break down how I should approach this.

First, I need to understand the structure of the given IR code. The code defines a function `_Z8is_boredNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` which takes a string as input and returns an integer. The function has several basic blocks labeled from 1 to 59, with some loops and conditional branches.

My goal is to map out the control flow between these blocks. Each label in the IR represents a basic block, which will be a node in the CFG. The edges between nodes are determined by the branching instructions like `br`, `switch`, etc.

Starting from the entry point, the function begins at label 1. The first instruction after 1 is a `br` to label 24 or 5 based on a condition. So, node 1 has edges to nodes 24 and 5.

Next, looking at label 5, it has a `br` to label 12 or 10 based on another condition. So, node 5 connects to 12 and 10.

Label 10 then branches to 26, so node 10 has an edge to node 26.

Label 12 is a bit more complex as it's a merge point for multiple branches. It has a `br` to 24 or 18. So, node 12 connects to 24 and 18.

Label 18 branches back to 24, creating a loop. So, node 18 points back to 24.

Label 24 is another merge point, which then returns the result. It connects back to itself if certain conditions are met, but in this case, it seems to be an exit point.

Label 26 is where things get intricate. It has a `switch` statement that can go to labels 41 or stay in 26, and then proceeds to 42. There are also back edges from 59 to 26, indicating a loop.

Label 42 leads to 59 through a series of operations, and 59 can loop back to 12 or 26. This creates a loop structure between 26, 42, and 59, as well as back to 12.

Putting this all together, the CFG will have nodes for each label and directed edges based on the branches. I'll structure the dot file accordingly, ensuring each node is represented and edges are correctly placed to show the control flow accurately.

I should make sure the dot syntax is correct, with each node as a circle and edges showing the direction of control flow. I'll avoid including the detailed contents of each block, focusing solely on the titles as per the user's request.

I think I've covered all the necessary connections. Now, I'll draft the dot file to represent this structure.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape="circle"];
    
    1[label="1"];
    5[label="5"];
    10[label="10"];
    12[label="12"];
    18[label="18"];
    24[label="24"];
    26[label="26"];
    41[label="41"];
    42[label="42"];
    59[label="59"];
    
    1 -> 24;
    1 -> 5;
    
    5 -> 12;
    5 -> 10;
    
    10 -> 26;
    
    12 -> 24;
    12 -> 18;
    
    18 -> 24;
    
    24 -> 24;
    
    26 -> 41;
    26 -> 42;
    26 -> 59;
    
    41 -> 42;
    
    42 -> 59;
    42 -> 26;
    
    59 -> 12;
    59 -> 26;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph of the given IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks. You can visualize this graph using a dot viewer or tool like Graphviz.
