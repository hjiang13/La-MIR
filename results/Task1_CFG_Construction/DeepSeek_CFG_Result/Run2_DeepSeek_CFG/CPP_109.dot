Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. First, I need to understand what the IR code represents. It looks like it's a function called `_Z13move_one_ballSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` which takes a vector as an argument and returns a boolean.

I remember that in IR, each basic block is a sequence of instructions ending with a branch or return. So, I'll go through the code and identify each basic block by their labels.

Starting from the top, the function begins with a series of loads and calculations. The first significant branch is `br i1 %10, label %72, label %11`. This means there's a conditional jump to either block 72 or 11.

Next, block 11 has another branch: `br i1 %12, label %14, label %52`. So from 11, it can go to 14 or 52.

Block 14 has `br i1 %16, label %48, label %17`, leading to 48 or 17.

Block 17 seems to loop back to itself via `br label %21`, which is a bit confusing. Wait, no, block 17 branches to 21, and then within 21, there's a loop that branches back to 21 or to 43.

Wait, block 21 has `br i1 %42, label %43, label %21`, so it's a loop between 21 and itself, with the exit going to 43.

From 43, there's a branch to either 52 or 48, depending on the condition.

Block 48 has a `br label %61`, so it goes to 61.

Block 52 has `br label %72`, which is the exit block.

Block 61 loops back to itself via `br i1 %71, label %52, label %61`, meaning it can go to 52 or stay in 61.

Block 72 is the exit block where the function returns.

Putting this all together, I need to map each block and its successors. I'll list each block and where it can jump to.

I might have missed some connections, especially within the loops, but I think I've captured the main paths. Now, I'll represent this as a dot file, showing each node and its edges without detailing the block contents.

Below is the control flow graph in dot file format, showing the basic blocks and their connections:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, color=lightblue];
    
    1 [label="1"];
    72 [label="72"];
    11 [label="11"];
    14 [label="14"];
    48 [label="48"];
    17 [label="17"];
    21 [label="21"];
    43 [label="43"];
    52 [label="52"];
    61 [label="61"];
    
    1 -> 72 [label="on true"];
    1 -> 11 [label="on false"];
    
    11 -> 14 [label="on true"];
    11 -> 52 [label="on false"];
    
    14 -> 48 [label="on true"];
    14 -> 17 [label="on false"];
    
    17 -> 21;
    
    21 -> 21 [label="loop back"];
    21 -> 43 [label="exit loop"];
    
    43 -> 52 [label="on true"];
    43 -> 48 [label="on false"];
    
    48 -> 61;
    
    52 -> 72;
    
    61 -> 52 [label="on true"];
    61 -> 61 [label="loop back"];
    
    72 -> 72 [label="exit"];
}
```

This graph shows the flow of control between the basic blocks of the function. Each block is represented as a node, and edges show possible control flow transitions.
