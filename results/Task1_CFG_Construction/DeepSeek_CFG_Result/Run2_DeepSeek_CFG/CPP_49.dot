Okay, so I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. It's a function named @_Z4modpii which takes two i32 parameters. The function has several basic blocks, each labeled with a number like 2, 4, 8, etc. My task is to represent the flow of control between these blocks as nodes in a graph, showing how each block branches to others.

I remember that in a CFG, each node represents a basic block, and edges represent the possible control flow between them. So, I'll start by listing all the basic blocks present in the code.

Looking at the code, the blocks are:
- Block 2
- Block 4
- Block 8
- Block 10
- Block 14
- Block 21
- Block 23

Next, I need to see how each block connects to others. I'll go through each block and note the branches.

Starting with Block 2:
- It has a branch to Block 4 if %3 is true, and to Block 21 if false. So, Block 2 has edges to 4 and 21.

Block 4:
- It branches to Block 10 if %7 is true, else to Block 8. So, Block 4 connects to 10 and 8.

Block 8:
- It only branches to Block 23, so an edge from 8 to 23.

Block 10:
- It has a phi node, which means it's a merge point. The phi nodes show that it can come from Block 4 or Block 23. Then, it branches to Block 21 if %13 is true, else to Block 14. So, Block 10 connects to 21 and 14.

Block 14:
- It's a loop, so it has a phi node for %15 and %16, indicating it can loop back to itself or exit. It branches to Block 21 if %20 is true, else back to Block 14. So, Block 14 connects to 21 and loops back to itself.

Block 21:
- It's the exit block, ret i32 %22. So, it doesn't branch anywhere else, just ends.

Block 23:
- It's another loop. It has phi nodes for %24 and %25, meaning it can come from Block 8 or itself. After some operations, it branches back to Block 10 if %35 is true, else loops back to Block 23. So, Block 23 connects to 10 and itself.

Putting all these connections together, I can draw the CFG with edges as described. I should make sure each node is correctly linked based on the branches and loops in the code.

I think I've covered all the blocks and their connections. Maybe I missed something, but this seems to cover the flow based on the IR provided.

Here is the control flow graph represented in dot language, showing the nodes and edges for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    label="2";
    label="4";
    label="8";
    label="10";
    label="14";
    label="21";
    label="23";
    
    "2" -> "4";
    "2" -> "21";
    
    "4" -> "10";
    "4" -> "8";
    
    "8" -> "23";
    
    "10" -> "21";
    "10" -> "14";
    
    "14" -> "21";
    "14" -> "14"; // loop
    
    "23" -> "10";
    "23" -> "23"; // loop
}
```

This graph shows all the basic blocks as nodes and the control flow edges between them.
