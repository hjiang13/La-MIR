Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to generate a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm not very familiar with IR, but I know that CFGs are used to represent the flow of control in a program, showing how execution moves between different basic blocks.

First, I need to understand the structure of the IR code provided. It looks like it's in LLVM IR format. The function in question is `@_Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which seems to be a C++ function that's been mangled. I think it's a function that operates on vectors, maybe something like plucking elements from one vector into another.

Looking at the code, I see that it starts with some alloca instructions, which I believe are used for allocating space on the stack. Then there are several `getelementptr` instructions, which are used to compute addresses of elements within aggregates (like arrays or structs). The function also uses `bitcast` to change the type of pointers, which is common in IR for type conversions.

The main part I'm interested in is the control flow, so I should focus on the `br` (branch) instructions. Each `br` instruction can be conditional or unconditional, and it transfers control to a label. Basic blocks are separated by labels, and each block ends with a `br` instruction.

Let me go through the code step by step to identify the basic blocks and their connections.

1. The function starts at label `2`. The first instruction after that is `br i1 %19, label %98, label %20`. So, from block `2`, there's a conditional branch to either block `98` or `20`.

2. Moving to block `20`, which is a `phi` block. Phi nodes are used at the beginning of a block to merge values from different predecessors. There are multiple `phi` instructions here, which suggests that block `20` is a merge point of several possible paths.

3. Block `20` ends with `br i1 %28, label %29, label %88`. So, depending on the condition, it branches to `29` or `88`.

4. Block `29` ends with `br i1 %35, label %39, label %36`. So, conditionally branches to `39` or `36`.

5. Block `36` ends with `br i1 %38, label %39, label %88`. So, conditionally branches to `39` or `88`.

6. Block `39` ends with `br i1 %45, label %46, label %57`. So, branches to `46` or `57`.

7. Block `46` ends with `invoke` to call a function and then branches to `48` or `82` on exception.

8. Block `48` ends with `br i1 %51, label %54, label %52`. So, conditionally branches to `54` or `52`.

9. Block `52` ends with `br label %54`. So, it's an unconditional branch to `54`.

10. Block `54` ends with `br label %78`. Unconditional to `78`.

11. Block `57` ends with `br i1 %58, label %65, label %59`. So, conditionally branches to `65` or `59`.

12. Block `59` ends with `br i1 %63, label %78, label %64`. So, conditionally branches to `78` or `64`.

13. Block `64` ends with `br label %78`. Unconditional to `78`.

14. Block `65` ends with `br i1 %67, label %72, label %68`. Conditionally to `72` or `68`.

15. Block `68` ends with `br label %72`. Unconditional to `72`.

16. Block `72` ends with `br label %78`. Unconditional to `78`.

17. Block `78` ends with `call void @llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8(...)` and then `br label %88`. Unconditional to `88`.

18. Block `82` is a landing pad for exceptions. It ends with `resume { i8*, i32 } %83`, which I think throws an exception, but in terms of control flow, it's an exceptional exit.

19. Block `85` is another part of the exception handling, ending with `br label %87`.

20. Block `87` ends with `resume { i8*, i32 } %83`, which again is an exceptional exit.

21. Block `88` ends with `br i1 %97, label %20, label %98, !llvm.loop !12`. So, conditionally branches back to `20` or to `98`.

22. Block `98` is the exit block, ending with `ret void`.

Now, to construct the CFG, each label represents a node, and each `br` instruction represents an edge from the current node to the target node(s).

I need to map each label to a node and draw edges based on the branches. The tricky part is handling the phi nodes and loops correctly, especially since there's a loop involving blocks `20`, `29`, `36`, `88`, etc.

I should also note that some blocks are part of exception handling, like `82` and `85`, but since the user didn't specify handling exceptions, I might focus on the normal control flow, unless instructed otherwise.

Putting it all together, the CFG will have nodes for each label and edges based on the branches. I'll represent this in a DOT file format, showing each node and the edges between them.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify each basic block (labeled with a number) and the control flow between them. Each `br` instruction indicates an edge from the current block to the target blocks. Here's the structured CFG:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, color=lightblue];
    
    2 [label="2"];
    20 [label="20"];
    29 [label="29"];
    36 [label="36"];
    39 [label="39"];
    46 [label="46"];
    48 [label="48"];
    52 [label="52"];
    54 [label="54"];
    57 [label="57"];
    59 [label="59"];
    64 [label="64"];
    65 [label="65"];
    68 [label="68"];
    72 [label="72"];
    78 [label="78"];
    82 [label="82"];
    85 [label="85"];
    87 [label="87"];
    88 [label="88"];
    98 [label="98"];

    2 -> 98 [label="cond"];
    2 -> 20 [label="cond"];

    20 -> 29 [label="cond"];
    20 -> 88 [label="cond"];

    29 -> 39 [label="cond"];
    29 -> 36 [label="cond"];

    36 -> 39 [label="cond"];
    36 -> 88 [label="cond"];

    39 -> 46 [label="cond"];
    39 -> 57 [label="cond"];

    46 -> 48 [label="normal"];
    46 -> 82 [label="exception"];

    48 -> 54 [label="cond"];
    48 -> 52 [label="cond"];

    52 -> 54 [label="uncond"];

    54 -> 78 [label="uncond"];

    57 -> 65 [label="cond"];
    57 -> 59 [label="cond"];

    59 -> 78 [label="cond"];
    59 -> 64 [label="cond"];

    64 -> 78 [label="uncond"];

    65 -> 72 [label="cond"];
    65 -> 68 [label="cond"];

    68 -> 72 [label="uncond"];

    72 -> 78 [label="uncond"];

    78 -> 88 [label="uncond"];

    82 -> 85 [label="cond"];
    82 -> 87 [label="cond"];

    85 -> 87 [label="uncond"];

    87 -> 83 [label="exception"];

    88 -> 20 [label="cond"];
    88 -> 98 [label="cond"];

    98 ->  [label="exit"];
}
```

This DOT file represents the CFG where each node corresponds to a basic block, and edges represent control flow transitions. The graph includes conditional and unconditional branches, loops, and exception handling paths. You can visualize this using tools like Graphviz.
