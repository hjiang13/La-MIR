Alright, I need to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The user provided an LLVM IR snippet, and my task is to analyze it and represent the CFG in a dot file format. 

First, I'll look through the IR code to identify the basic blocks. In LLVM IR, each basic block is labeled with a number followed by a colon. So, I'll scan through the code and note down all the labels I see. 

Looking at the code, I see labels like 3, 16, 20, 35, 36, 37, 39, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 57, 58. Each of these represents a basic block in the function. 

Next, I need to determine the control flow between these blocks. I'll examine the branching instructions. For example, after label 3, the code branches to either 57 or 16 based on the result of an icmp instruction. So, there's an edge from 3 to 16 and another to 57.

Moving through the code, I see that label 16 has a phi instruction, which means it's a merge point for multiple incoming edges. The phi instruction shows that 16 can be reached from 3 and 48. So, I'll draw edges from 3 and 48 to 16.

Label 16 then branches to 20 if a certain condition is met. So, from 16, there's an edge to 20. Inside 20, there's another branch based on an icmp result, leading to either 35 or 44. So, edges from 20 to 35 and 20 to 44.

Label 35 has a branch to either 36 or 48. So, edges from 35 to 36 and 35 to 48. Label 36 is a call instruction, and after that, it goes to 37. So, an edge from 36 to 37. Then, 37 goes back to 48, creating a loop.

Label 44 branches to either 45 or 48. So, edges from 44 to 45 and 44 to 48. Label 45 is another call instruction leading to 46, which then goes back to 48.

Label 48 is another merge point with a phi instruction, indicating it can be reached from multiple places: 46, 44, 37, and 35. So, edges from these blocks to 48.

Continuing, label 48 eventually leads back to 16, forming the loop. Finally, when the loop exits, it goes to 57, which is the exit block. There's also an error handling block, 58, which is reached from 39 and 43, but it's a terminal node.

Putting all these edges together, I can construct the CFG. Each node represents a basic block, and edges show the possible control flow paths. The final dot file will visually represent this structure, making it easy to understand the program's flow.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    3[label="3"];
    16[label="16"];
    20[label="20"];
    35[label="35"];
    36[label="36"];
    37[label="37"];
    39[label="39"];
    43[label="43"];
    44[label="44"];
    45[label="45"];
    46[label="46"];
    48[label="48"];
    57[label="57"];
    58[label="58"];

    3 -> 16;
    3 -> 57;

    16 -> 20;

    20 -> 35;
    20 -> 44;

    35 -> 36;
    35 -> 48;

    36 -> 37;

    37 -> 48;

    44 -> 45;
    44 -> 48;

    45 -> 46;

    46 -> 48;

    48 -> 16;
    48 -> 57;

    39 -> 43;
    39 -> 58;

    43 -> 58;

    57 -> 58;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph of the given IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks. You can visualize this graph using a dot viewer to see the program's control flow structure.
