Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I remember that a CFG represents the flow of control through a program, with nodes as basic blocks and edges as jumps between them. 

First, I'll look through the IR code to identify all the labels, which correspond to basic blocks. The code starts with some module and function definitions, and then there's the function @_Z9solutionsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. 

I see several labels: 74, 10, 17, 20, 66, 70, 76. Each of these is a basic block. I'll list each one as a node in the CFG.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these nodes. I'll look for branch instructions (br) to see where each block jumps to. 

- The first branch is after label %1 (which I assume is the entry point) to labels %74 and %10. So, the entry node has edges to 74 and 10.
- Label 10 has a branch to labels %70 and %17. So, 10 connects to 70 and 17.
- Label 17 branches to 20. So, 17 -> 20.
- Label 20 loops back to itself and also goes to 66. So, 20 -> 20 and 20 -> 66.
- Label 66 branches to 74 and 70. So, 66 -> 74 and 66 -> 70.
- Label 70 goes to 76. So, 70 -> 76.
- Label 76 loops back to itself and also goes to 74. So, 76 -> 76 and 76 -> 74.

Putting this all together, I can draw the graph with nodes as the labels and edges based on the branches.

I should also note that some blocks are loops, like 20 and 76, which have back edges. This helps in understanding the flow, especially for optimization or analysis purposes.

Finally, I'll present this in a dot file format, showing each node and the directed edges between them based on the branches I identified.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their control flow. Here's the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    entry -> 74;
    entry -> 10;

    10 -> 70;
    10 -> 17;

    17 -> 20;

    20 -> 20;
    20 -> 66;

    66 -> 74;
    66 -> 70;

    70 -> 76;

    76 -> 76;
    76 -> 74;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph where nodes are basic blocks (labeled numerically), and directed edges represent control flow between blocks. The graph shows the structure of the program's execution flow, including loops and conditional branches.
