Okay, so I'm trying to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best to figure it out step by step.

First, I need to understand what the IR code is doing. The function is called `_Z10choose_numii`, which I think is a C++ function that's been mangled. It takes two integers as arguments. The code has several basic blocks, each ending with a branch instruction that determines the flow of the program.

Looking at the code, I see labels like 2, 4, 9, 12. Each of these represents a basic block in the CFG. The function starts at label 2, which is the entry point. From there, it executes some instructions and then branches to either label 12 or label 4 based on the result of the comparison.

In label 4, there's another condition checked, and depending on that, it either branches to label 12 or label 9. Label 9 does some calculations and then branches to label 12. Label 12 is where the function returns, using a phi node to determine the return value based on which block it came from.

So, the nodes in the CFG are the labels: 2, 4, 9, 12. The edges are determined by the branch instructions. From label 2, there's a branch to 12 and to 4. From 4, branches go to 12 and 9. From 9, it goes to 12. Label 12 is the exit node.

Putting this together, the CFG will have edges from 2 to 4 and 2 to 12. From 4, edges go to 9 and 12. From 9, an edge goes to 12.

I think that's all the connections. Now, I just need to represent this in a dot file format, showing each node and the edges between them without listing the contents of each block.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their control flow. The nodes represent the basic blocks, and the edges represent the control flow between them.

### Control Flow Graph (CFG) in Dot Format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    2 [label="2"];
    4 [label="4"];
    9 [label="9"];
    12 [label="12"];

    2 -> 4;
    2 -> 12;
    4 -> 9;
    4 -> 12;
    9 -> 12;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Nodes:** Each label (2, 4, 9, 12) is a node in the CFG, representing a basic block.
- **Edges:** The edges show the possible control flow paths:
  - From node 2, the program can go to node 4 or node 12.
  - From node 4, it can proceed to node 9 or node 12.
  - From node 9, it moves to node 12.
  - Node 12 is the termination point where the function returns.

This graph captures the control flow of the function, illustrating how execution can move between different parts of the code based on conditions.
