Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given an IR code and I need to construct a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. The CFG should have nodes representing basic blocks and edges showing the control flow between them.

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. It's a function named @_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE, which seems to be a minSubArraySum function taking a vector of long longs. The code starts with some target and data layout information, followed by type definitions for std::vector and its internal structures.

The function is defined with several basic blocks, each starting with a label. My task is to identify these labels and the control flow between them.

Looking through the code, I see labels like 1, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, 34. These labels are followed by instructions that might branch to other labels using 'br' instructions.

I'll start by listing all the labels as nodes. Then, for each 'br' instruction, I'll note the source and destination labels to create edges.

For example, the first 'br' is 'br i1 %11, label %12, label %32'. This means there's a branch from label 1 to either 12 or 32 based on the condition in %11.

Continuing this process, I'll map each branch instruction to connect the corresponding labels. It's important to ensure that all possible paths are considered, including loops and conditional branches.

I also notice that some labels, like 18 and 34, are part of loops. I'll need to correctly represent the loop structure by connecting the back edges.

Once all edges are mapped, I'll structure the DOT file with nodes and edges, ensuring that the flow is accurately represented.

I should double-check each connection to avoid missing any branches or misconnecting the labels. It's easy to make a mistake with so many labels and branches, so careful attention is necessary.

Finally, I'll format the DOT file correctly, making sure each node is declared and each edge is properly connected with '->' notation.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code, we'll represent each basic block as a node and each control flow instruction as a directed edge between nodes. Here's the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"];
    12[label="12"];
    16[label="16"];
    18[label="18"];
    24[label="24"];
    32[label="32"];
    34[label="34"];

    1 -> 12;
    1 -> 32;

    12 -> 18;
    12 -> 16;

    16 -> 34;

    18 -> 24;
    18 -> 32;

    24 -> 32;

    34 -> 18;
    34 -> 34;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the IR code (e.g., 1, 12, 16, etc.).
- **Edges**: Each edge represents a control flow path between basic blocks. For example:
  - From block `1`, there are two possible paths: one to block `12` and another to block `32`.
  - Block `12` branches to either block `18` or block `16`.
  - Block `34` has a loop edge pointing back to itself and another edge to block `18`.

This DOT file captures the control flow structure of the given IR code, showing how execution flows between different basic blocks.
