Alright, I need to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code. Let me start by understanding the task. The user has given me some LLVM IR code, and they want me to generate a CFG in dot format, showing the nodes and edges without the detailed content of each basic block.

First, I should recall what a CFG is. A CFG is a graphical representation of a program's control flow, where each node represents a basic block (a sequence of instructions without branches), and edges represent possible control flow between these blocks.

Looking at the IR code provided, it's a function named @_Z11max_elementSt6vectorIfSaIfEE, which seems to be a C++ function compiled into LLVM IR. The function calculates the maximum element in a vector. The IR includes several labels (like %1, %2, etc.) that correspond to different basic blocks.

I need to parse this IR code and identify all the basic blocks and their connections. Each label in the code represents a basic block. So, I'll list all the labels present and then determine how they connect based on branch instructions (like br, switch, etc.).

Let me go through the code step by step:

1. The function starts with label %1, which is the entry point.
2. It then checks if %8 is zero. If true, it branches to %34; else, it goes to %10.
3. In %10, there's a computation and a branch to either %18 or %16.
4. %16 seems to handle a specific case and then branches to %36.
5. %18 is a loop with some computations and branches back to itself or to %34.
6. %34 is an exit block where the function returns.
7. %36 is another loop that processes the vector in chunks and eventually branches back to %18 or continues.

I should represent each of these labels as nodes in the graph. The edges will be determined by the 'br' instructions, showing where each block can jump to.

I also need to make sure that each node is correctly connected. For example, %1 branches to %34 and %10, so there should be edges from %1 to both. Similarly, %10 branches to %18 and %16, so edges from %10 to those.

One thing to note is that some blocks (like %18 and %36) have phi nodes, indicating that they might be loop headers or part of more complex control flow. I need to ensure that all possible paths are correctly represented, especially loops that can branch back to themselves or to other blocks.

I should also be careful with the phi instructions, as they can indicate multiple incoming edges to a block. However, in the CFG, each block's incoming edges are determined by where the 'br' instructions point, not the phi nodes themselves.

Now, I'll structure this into a dot file. Each node will be a circle with the label as the node name. Edges will be arrows showing the control flow between nodes.

I'll start by listing all the nodes: %1, %10, %16, %18, %23, %34, %36. Wait, looking back, I see that %23 is also a label, so that's another node. I'll include that as well.

Wait, in the code, after %18, there's a loop that uses %23 as part of the loop, but in the IR, the branch from %23 goes back to %23, meaning it's part of the same block's loop. So, I need to make sure that the edges from %23 are correctly pointing.

Wait, no, looking again, the code has:

br i1 %33, label %34, label %23, !llvm.loop !11

So, from %23, it can branch back to itself or to %34. Therefore, %23 should have edges to %34 and itself.

But wait, in the initial code, the labels are %1, %2, ..., but in the code provided, the labels used are %1, %10, %16, %18, %23, %34, %36. So, those are the nodes.

So the nodes are:

- %1
- %10
- %16
- %18
- %23
- %34
- %36

Now, mapping the edges:

- %1 -> %34 (if %9 is true)
- %1 -> %10 (if %9 is false)
- %10 -> %18 (if %15 is true)
- %10 -> %16 (if %15 is false)
- %16 -> %36
- %18 -> %34 (if %22 is true)
- %18 -> %23 (if %22 is false)
- %23 -> %34 (if %33 is true)
- %23 -> %23 (if %33 is false, loop back)
- %36 -> %18 (if %61 is true)
- %36 -> %36 (if %61 is false, loop back)

Wait, but in the code, from %36, it branches to %18 and back to %36. So, the edge from %36 is to %18 and %36.

But in the code, the 'br' instruction in %36 is:

br i1 %61, label %18, label %36

So, if %61 is true, go to %18; else, loop back to %36.

Similarly, in %23, the 'br' is:

br i1 %33, label %34, label %23

So, if true, go to %34; else, loop back to %23.

So, the edges are:

- %1 -> %34
- %1 -> %10
- %10 -> %18
- %10 -> %16
- %16 -> %36
- %18 -> %34
- %18 -> %23
- %23 -> %34
- %23 -> %23 (loop)
- %36 -> %18
- %36 -> %36 (loop)

But wait, in the code, from %18, after some computations, it does:

br i1 %33, label %34, label %23

So, from %18, it can go to %34 or %23. So, the edges are:

%18 -> %34
%18 -> %23

Similarly, from %36, it can go to %18 or loop back to %36.

So, the edges are:

%36 -> %18
%36 -> %36

Putting it all together, the nodes are %1, %10, %16, %18, %23, %34, %36.

Now, I'll structure this into a dot file.

I'll define each node as a circle with the label. Then, draw edges between them as per the branches.

I should also note that %23 is part of a loop, so it has a self-edge, and %36 also has a self-edge for the loop.

So, the final dot file will have nodes connected as per the above edges.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we identify each basic block (represented by labels) and the control flow between them. Here's the CFG in dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=circle];
    
    "%1" -> "%34";
    "%1" -> "%10";
    
    "%10" -> "%18";
    "%10" -> "%16";
    
    "%16" -> "%36";
    
    "%18" -> "%34";
    "%18" -> "%23";
    
    "%23" -> "%34";
    "%23" -> "%23" [label = "loop"];
    
    "%36" -> "%18";
    "%36" -> "%36" [label = "loop"];
    
    "%34" [shape=doublecircle];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with nodes as basic blocks and edges showing the flow between them. Each node is labeled with its respective IR label, and edges indicate possible control transitions.
