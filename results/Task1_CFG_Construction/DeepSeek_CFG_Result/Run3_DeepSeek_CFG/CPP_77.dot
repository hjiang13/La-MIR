Okay, so I need to help the user by creating a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The user provided an LLVM IR snippet and wants the CFG in DOT file format, showing the nodes and edges without the detailed content of each basic block. 

First, I should understand the structure of the IR code. The code defines a function `_Z7iscuberi` which takes an integer and returns a boolean. There's a loop involved, as indicated by the labels and the phi instruction.

I'll start by identifying the basic blocks. Each label in the code represents a basic block. Looking at the code, the labels are 1, 3, and 9. Wait, label 1 isn't explicitly defined in the code; the function starts with label 1 implicitly, I think. So maybe the entry block is label 1.

In the function, the first instruction is a call to `llvm.abs.i32`, which is in label 1. Then it branches to label 3. So the first edge is from 1 to 3.

Label 3 is a loop. It has a phi node for %4, which takes values from %1 and %3. So label 3 has predecessors from label 1 (initially) and itself (looping back). The loop continues as long as the condition %7 is true, which is `icmp ult i32 %6, %2`. If true, it branches back to label 3; if false, it goes to label 9.

Label 9 is the exit block where it returns the result of the comparison %10.

So the basic blocks are 1, 3, and 9. Now, I need to map the edges between them.

From block 1, there's only one edge to block 3. Block 3 can loop back to itself or go to block 9. Block 9 has no outgoing edges since it's the exit.

Putting this together, the DOT file should have nodes for each block and edges representing the control flow.

I should write the DOT code accordingly, making sure each node is labeled correctly and edges are properly connected.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we will represent each basic block as a node and the control flow between them as directed edges. Here's the CFG in the DOT file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label_1[label="1"];
    label_3[label="3"];
    label_9[label="9"];

    label_1 -> label_3;
    label_3 -> label_3[label="loop"];
    label_3 -> label_9;
}
```

This DOT file describes the control flow graph with nodes representing the basic blocks (1, 3, 9) and edges showing the control flow between them.
