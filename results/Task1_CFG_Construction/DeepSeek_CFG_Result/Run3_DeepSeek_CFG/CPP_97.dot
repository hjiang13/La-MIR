Okay, so I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code is doing. 

The code defines a function called multiply which takes two i32 arguments. The function starts by taking the absolute value of the first argument using llvm.abs.i32, then computes the remainder when divided by 10. It does the same for the second argument. Then it multiplies these two remainders together and returns the result.

Looking at the IR code, I see that there are no conditional branches or loops, just a sequence of instructions. Each instruction is part of a single basic block since there are no control flow changes like if statements or loops.

So, the CFG will have a single node representing the entire function because there's only one basic block. The function starts and ends without any branching, so there are no edges to other nodes. 

I should represent this as a dot file with one node labeled "multiply" and no edges since the control flow doesn't split or merge anywhere. That should accurately show the structure of the IR code provided.

To create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we first analyze the structure of the code. The IR code defines a function `@_Z8multiplyii` which performs a series of operations without any conditional branches or loops. This means that the function consists of a single basic block.

Here is the CFG represented in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    multiply [label="multiply"];
}
```

This dot file represents a control flow graph with a single node labeled "multiply". Since there are no control flow changes (e.g., conditional branches or loops), there are no edges between nodes.
