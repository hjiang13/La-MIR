Alright, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code. Let me start by understanding the structure of the IR code and identifying the basic blocks.

Looking at the IR code, the function is named @_Z15below_thresholdSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi. It has several labels: 2, 12, 16, 19, 24, 26. Each of these labels represents the start of a basic block. 

I'll list out the basic blocks and their connections based on the branch instructions. 

- Block 2: This is the entry block. It starts with some computations and then branches to either block 26 or block 12 based on the condition %11.
- Block 12: It performs a few operations and then branches to block 16 if %15 is true, otherwise to block 26.
- Block 16: This is a loop header. It has a phi node and branches back to itself or proceeds to block 19 based on %18.
- Block 19: Inside the loop, it does some more operations and branches back to block 16 or exits to block 24 based on %22.
- Block 24: After exiting the loop, it checks %25 and then branches to block 26.
- Block 26: The exit block where the function returns.

Now, I'll map out the edges between these blocks based on how they branch. Each edge represents a possible execution path from one block to another.

Finally, I'll represent this CFG in a dot file format, showing each node as a basic block and the edges as directed connections.

To create a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we analyze the basic blocks and their control flow. Here's the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];

    label_2[label="2"];
    label_12[label="12"];
    label_16[label="16"];
    label_19[label="19"];
    label_24[label="24"];
    label_26[label="26"];

    label_2 -> label_12[label="br (condition false)"];
    label_2 -> label_26[label="br (condition true)"];

    label_12 -> label_16[label="br (condition true)"];
    label_12 -> label_26[label="br (condition false)"];

    label_16 -> label_19[label="br (condition false)"];
    label_16 -> label_16[label="br (condition true, loop)"];

    label_19 -> label_16[label="br (condition true)"];
    label_19 -> label_24[label="br (condition false)"];

    label_24 -> label_26[label="br"];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph, where each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code, and edges represent the control flow between these blocks.
