Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided some LLVM IR code and want me to generate a CFG in DOT format, showing the nodes and edges without the detailed content of each basic block.

First, I need to parse the IR code to identify the basic blocks. In LLVM IR, a basic block is a sequence of instructions ending with a terminator instruction like 'br', 'ret', etc. Each basic block starts with a label, like '%0', '%1', etc.

Looking at the provided IR code, I see that it's a function named @_Z3addii which takes two i32 parameters and returns an i32. The function has a single basic block. Here's the breakdown:

1. The function starts with the label 'define dso_local i32 @_Z3addii(i32 %0, i32 %1) local_unnamed_addr #0 {'
2. Inside the function, there's an instruction '%3 = add nsw i32 %1, %0' which adds the two arguments.
3. The function ends with 'ret i32 %3', which returns the result.

Since there's only one basic block, the CFG will have just one node. The node's title should be the function name, and since there are no branches or multiple blocks, there are no edges to draw.

I need to represent this in DOT language. Each node is typically represented as a label, and edges are directed with arrows. In this case, since there's only one node, the CFG is straightforward.

Wait, but sometimes the entry block is considered separately. However, in this function, the entry is the same as the only block. So, I'll just have one node named after the function.

So, the DOT file will have a single node without any edges. That should satisfy the user's request.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code, we first identify the basic blocks. In this case, there's only one basic block in the function `@_Z3addii`. Here's how the CFG is represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    @_Z3addii [label="Function @_Z3addii"];
}
```

This DOT file represents a single node corresponding to the function, as there are no branches or additional basic blocks in the code.
