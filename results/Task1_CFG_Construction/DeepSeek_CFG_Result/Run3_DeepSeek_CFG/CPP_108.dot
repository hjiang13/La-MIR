Okay, let's see. I need to help the user create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The user provided an LLVM IR code snippet, and they want the CFG in dot file format, showing the nodes and edges without the details of each basic block.

First, I'll start by understanding the IR code. It's a function called `_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` which takes a vector of integers and returns an integer. The function seems to count something based on the vector's elements.

Looking at the code, I'll identify the basic blocks. Each label in the IR corresponds to a basic block in the CFG. The labels I see are 1, 10, 13, 15, 21, 24, 31, and 36. Wait, label 1 isn't explicitly named, but it's the entry point, so I'll include it as the start node.

Next, I'll map out the control flow. The function starts at label 1. It then checks if the size is zero, branching to label 13 if true, else to label 10. So, node 1 has edges to 10 and 13.

Label 10 is where the loop starts. It calculates some initial values and then branches to label 15. So, 10 goes to 15.

Label 15 is a loop. It has some computations and conditionally branches back to itself or to label 36. Wait, looking closer, from 15, there's a branch to 36 if the condition is met, else it continues in the loop. Hmm, maybe 15 branches to 21 and 36? Wait, in the code, after label 15, it goes to label 18, then checks a condition, branching to 36 or 21. So, 15 leads to 21 and 36.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine. Label 15 is a phi node, so it's the start of a loop. It goes to 18, then 19, then 20. The branch at 20 goes to 36 if true, else to 21. So, 15 leads to 21 and 36.

Label 21 handles negative numbers. It checks if the number is less than -9, branching to 24 or 31. So, 21 leads to 24 and 31.

Label 24 is a loop that processes each digit. It has a branch back to itself if a condition is met, else it goes to 31. So, 24 leads to 24 and 31.

Label 31 checks if the sum is greater than the original number, branching to 36 if true, else it continues. So, 31 leads to 36.

Label 36 is another loop that increments the count and checks if it's done, branching back to 15 or exiting to 13. So, 36 leads to 15 and 13.

Label 13 is the exit point where the function returns.

Putting this all together, I'll draw the nodes and edges. Each node is a label, and edges represent control flow between them.

I'll make sure to represent all the connections accurately, even if some nodes like 24 loop back to themselves or others like 15 and 36 form loops.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    1 [label="Entry"];
    10 [label="Label 10"];
    13 [label="Label 13 (Exit)"];
    15 [label="Label 15"];
    21 [label="Label 21"];
    24 [label="Label 24"];
    31 [label="Label 31"];
    36 [label="Label 36"];

    1 -> 10;
    1 -> 13;
    10 -> 15;
    15 -> 21;
    15 -> 36;
    21 -> 24;
    21 -> 31;
    24 -> 24;
    24 -> 31;
    31 -> 36;
    36 -> 15;
    36 -> 13;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph where:
- Each node represents a basic block in the IR code, labeled by its corresponding label number.
- Edges represent control flow between basic blocks.

You can visualize this graph using tools like Graphviz.
