Alright, so I've got this IR code here, and I need to convert it into a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. Honestly, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that IR stands for Intermediate Representation, which is like a mid-level code between the original source code and machine code. It's used by compilers to make the code easier to analyze and optimize. The code provided seems to be in LLVM IR, which I think uses a specific syntax.

Looking at the code, I see it's a function called `_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` which probably translates to a function called `smallest_change` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as an argument. The function returns an `i32`, so an integer.

Now, to build the CFG, I need to identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them. A basic block is a sequence of instructions that are executed in order without any branches or labels. Each label in the IR code represents the start of a new basic block.

I see that the function starts with some getelementptr and load instructions, which are memory accesses. Then there are some arithmetic operations and comparisons. The key parts for the CFG are the branch instructions, which determine the flow of control.

The first branch I notice is `br i1 %11, label %12, label %14`. So, there's a condition check, and based on that, the program either jumps to label 12 or 14. That means there's a split in the control flow, creating two possible paths.

Looking further, I see label 12 and label 14. Each of these is a new basic block. I also notice that label 14 has some phi instructions, which are used to merge values from different paths. Phi nodes are characteristic of the SSA (Static Single Assignment) form used in IR.

There's a loop involved because there's a `br` instruction that branches back to label 14, indicating a loop structure. The comment `!llvm.loop !11` confirms that this is part of a loop.

So, putting this together, the function starts at label 1 (the entry point), then based on the condition, it either goes to label 12 or 14. Label 14 seems to be part of a loop, which can either continue looping or exit back to label 12.

I need to represent this in DOT format. DOT is a graph description language used to create graphs with nodes and edges. Each node represents a basic block, and edges represent the control flow between them.

I'll start by creating nodes for each label: 1, 12, and 14. Then, I'll draw edges based on the branches. From node 1, there's a conditional branch to 12 and 14. Node 14 branches back to itself (the loop) and also to 12 when the loop exits.

Wait, but in the IR, the branch from 14 goes to itself and to 12. So in the CFG, node 14 will have two outgoing edges: one looping back to itself and another going to node 12.

I should make sure the nodes are labeled clearly. Typically, in DOT, each node is represented as a string, often enclosed in quotes if they contain special characters or spaces.

Putting it all together, the CFG should show the entry point, the conditional branch, the loop, and the merge points where the flow comes back together.

I think I've got the structure right. Now, I'll write this out in DOT format, making sure to include all nodes and their connecting edges based on the control flow.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node1 [label="1"]
    node12 [label="12"]
    node14 [label="14"]

    node1 -> node12 [label="br condition"]
    node1 -> node14 [label="br condition"]
    node14 -> node14 [label="loop back"]
    node14 -> node12 [label="exit loop"]
}
```

This graph represents the control flow of the function, showing the basic blocks and the flow between them. Each node corresponds to a label in the IR code, and edges show the possible control transitions.
