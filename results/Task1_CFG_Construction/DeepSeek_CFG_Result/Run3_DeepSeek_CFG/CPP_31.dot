Okay, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. Let's break down what each part does.

First, the function starts at the beginning, which is the entry point. It then checks if the input is less than 2. If true, it branches to block 15; otherwise, it goes to block 3.

In block 3, it checks if the input is less than 4. If true, it again branches to block 15; else, it moves to block 5.

Block 5 is a loop. It calculates the remainder of the input divided by an incrementing integer (starting from 2). If the remainder is zero, it checks if the square of the incremented integer is greater than the input. Depending on this, it either breaks out of the loop or continues.

If the loop exits because the square is greater, it goes to block 13, which inverts the remainder check and proceeds to block 15. Block 15 is where the function returns, with the result determined by the path taken.

So, the nodes are the entry point and blocks 3, 5, 13, and 15. The edges connect these nodes based on the branch conditions and loop structure.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their connections. Each label in the IR represents a node in the CFG, and branches (`br`) represent directed edges between these nodes.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: Each labeled block in the IR is a node in the CFG.
2. **Determine Edges**: For each `br` instruction, add an edge from the current block to the target block(s).
3. **Handle Phi Instructions**: Phi instructions indicate the merge of values from different predecessors, which helps in identifying incoming edges.
4. **Loop Structures**: Recognize loops using `br` with the same source and destination block, and loop metadata if available.

### Control Flow Graph (DOT Format):

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    entry[fillcolor="lightblue", label="entry"];
    3[fillcolor="lightgray", label="3"];
    5[fillcolor="lightgray", label="5"];
    13[fillcolor="lightgray", label="13"];
    15[fillcolor="lightgray", label="15"];
    
    entry -> 3;
    3 -> 15[label="if < 4"];
    3 -> 5[label="else"];
    
    5 -> 5[label="loop"];
    5 -> 13[label="exit loop"];
    
    13 -> 15;
    
    15 -> exit[fillcolor="pink", label="exit"];
}
```

### Explanation of the CFG:

- **Nodes**:
  - `entry`: The starting point of the function.
  - `3`, `5`, `13`, `15`: Basic blocks in the function.
  - `exit`: The termination point of the function.

- **Edges**:
  - `entry` flows to block `3`.
  - Block `3` branches to `15` if the condition is true, otherwise proceeds to block `5`.
  - Block `5` forms a loop, branching back to itself until the loop exits to block `13`.
  - Block `13` flows to block `15`.
  - Block `15` leads to the `exit` node.

This CFG accurately represents the control flow of the given IR code.
