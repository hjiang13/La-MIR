Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to generate a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The user has specified that the output should be in dot file format, showing the nodes and edges without detailing the content of each basic block, just their titles.

First, I'll start by understanding the IR code provided. It's written in LLVM IR, which I'm somewhat familiar with. The function in question is `_Z7hex_keyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, which seems to be a function that takes a string and returns an integer. The function has several basic blocks, each with their own labels.

My goal is to identify each basic block and the control flow between them. Each basic block is separated by a label, and the control flow is determined by branches (`br` instructions). So, I'll go through the IR code line by line to map out these blocks.

Starting from the top, the function begins with some setup for the string, initializing memory with `llvm.lifetime.start` and `llvm.memcpy`. This is all part of the initial block, which I'll label as `1`.

Next, there's a branch instruction: `br i1 %11, label %50, label %12`. This means that if the condition `%11` is true, the control flows to block `50`, otherwise it goes to block `12`. So, block `1` has two outgoing edges: one to `50` and another to `12`.

Moving on, block `12` is where the code loads some data from the string and initializes variables. It then moves into a loop structure. The loop starts at block `26`, which is a `phi` node, indicating the start of a loop. The loop continues until certain conditions are met, which then branches back to `26` or exits to `43` or `50`.

Block `26` has several conditional branches that check each character of the string against the characters in the static string "2357BD". Depending on whether a character matches, the control flow moves to different blocks (`32`, `34`, `36`, `38`, `40`, and back to `43`).

Each of these blocks (`32` to `40`) checks a specific character and either continues the loop or breaks out of it, incrementing counters and indices as necessary.

Block `43` is where the loop exits, and it has a condition to either continue the loop or exit to block `50`. Block `50` is the exit block where the function returns the result.

I need to represent all these blocks as nodes in the CFG. Each node will be labeled with its block number. The edges will be drawn based on the `br` instructions, showing the possible paths the control can take.

I'll structure the dot file with each node as a rectangle, labeled with the block number. The edges will be directed arrows showing the flow from one block to another. For example, block `1` will have edges to `50` and `12`, block `12` will have an edge to `26`, and so on.

I must ensure that all blocks are included and that their connections accurately represent the control flow. This involves carefully mapping each branch instruction and its targets. It's important to avoid missing any blocks or edges, as that would make the CFG incomplete or incorrect.

In summary, I'll systematically go through each block, identify its successor blocks based on branch instructions, and construct the CFG accordingly. This methodical approach will help in creating an accurate and complete control flow graph as per the user's request.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=rectangle];
    
    1[label="1"]
    12[label="12"]
    26[label="26"]
    32[label="32"]
    34[label="34"]
    36[label="36"]
    38[label="38"]
    40[label="40"]
    43[label="43"]
    50[label="50"]
    
    1 -> 50
    1 -> 12
    
    12 -> 26
    
    26 -> 32
    26 -> 43
    
    32 -> 43
    32 -> 34
    
    34 -> 43
    34 -> 36
    
    36 -> 43
    36 -> 38
    
    38 -> 43
    38 -> 40
    
    40 -> 43
    
    43 -> 50
    43 -> 26
}
```

This dot file describes the control flow graph, where each node represents a basic block and edges represent control flow between blocks.
