Alright, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The user has provided the IR in LLVM assembly format, and they want the output as a dot file showing the nodes and edges without the detailed content of each basic blockâ€”just the titles.

First, I'll look at the structure of the IR code. The function is defined as `@_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`, which seems to be a C++ function that likely computes the intersection of two vectors. The function starts with some initial setup, loading elements from the input vectors.

I'll identify the basic blocks by their labels in the code. Each label marks the beginning of a new basic block. Let's go through each part of the code.

1. **Entry Point and Initial Loads:**
   The function starts by loading elements from the input vectors into variables. This initial setup is the first basic block, which I'll call `%3` as per the code.

2. **Comparison and Conditional Branches:**
   After loading, there are comparisons and conditional branches. The first comparison is between `%8` and `%9`, leading to a select instruction. Then, there are further comparisons that determine the control flow.

3. **Basic Block Identifiers:**
   Each label in the code represents a new basic block. So, I'll list them out in order:
   - `%3` (entry)
   - `%20`
   - `%22`
   - `%29`
   - `%32`
   - `%37`
   - `%44`
   - `%50`

4. **Control Flow Edges:**
   Next, I'll determine how these blocks connect. The IR code uses `br` instructions to jump between blocks. For example, after the initial setup, there's a branch to `%22` or `%20` based on a condition. Then, within `%20`, another condition decides whether to go to `%44` or `%32`.

5. **Loop Structures:**
   There's a loop involving blocks `%32` and `%29`. The loop likely iterates until a certain condition is met, adding nodes and edges accordingly.

6. **Exit Point:**
   The function exits through block `%50`, which is the return point after executing one of the paths.

7. **Dot File Construction:**
   Now, I'll structure these blocks into a dot file. Each node will be represented as a block with its label. Edges will show the flow between these blocks based on the `br` instructions and conditions.

8. **Verification:**
   I'll double-check to ensure all blocks are included and edges accurately represent the control flow. For example, block `%32` has a phi instruction, indicating it's a merge point from `%20` and `%29`.

9. **Final Output:**
   The dot file will clearly show the entry, the decision points, the loop, and the exit, making the control flow easy to visualize.

I think I've covered all the necessary blocks and their connections. Now, I'll present the dot file as the final answer.

Here is the control flow graph of the given IR code in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];

    %3 [label="Entry Block"];
    %20 [label="Block 20"];
    %22 [label="Block 22"];
    %29 [label="Block 29"];
    %32 [label="Block 32"];
    %37 [label="Block 37"];
    %44 [label="Block 44"];
    %50 [label="Block 50"];

    %3 -> %20;
    %3 -> %22;

    %20 -> %44;
    %20 -> %32;

    %22 -> %50;

    %29 -> %44;
    %29 -> %32;

    %32 -> %29;
    %32 -> %37;

    %37 -> %50;

    %44 -> %50;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph, showing the basic blocks as nodes and the control flow edges between them. Each node is labeled with the block identifier, and edges represent the possible control flow between blocks.
