Okay, so I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code is doing. The function is called _Z20right_angle_trianglefff and it takes three float arguments. It returns a boolean (i1). 

Looking at the code, it seems to be checking if the three floats form a right-angled triangle. That is, it's checking if any one of the three conditions (a² + b² ≈ c², a² + c² ≈ b², b² + c² ≈ a²) holds true within a small epsilon (1e-4). 

The function starts by computing the squares of the inputs and then checks each pair to see if their sum minus the square of the third is close enough to zero. Each of these checks corresponds to a basic block in the IR code.

Let's break down the code step by step. The function begins at label 3, which isn't shown in the input but is implied as the entry point. From there, it computes %4, %5, %6, etc., and then branches based on the comparison results.

Each comparison (like %11, %17, %23) leads to a branch. If any of the conditions are met, the function branches to label 25, which is the exit block. If not, it proceeds to check the next condition.

So, the basic blocks are:
1. Entry block (implicitly label 3)
2. Block 12
3. Block 18
4. Block 24
5. Exit block (label 25)

Each block corresponds to a node in the CFG. The edges are determined by the branches. For example, from the entry block, if the first condition is true, it goes to 25; if false, it goes to 12. Similarly, from 12, if the second condition is true, it goes to 25; if false, it goes to 18. From 18, if the third condition is true, it goes to 25; if false, it goes to 24, which then goes to 25.

I need to represent this as a dot file, showing each node and the edges between them, including labels. Since the user specified not to list the content of each basic block, I'll just name them as BB3, BB12, BB18, BB24, and BB25.

So, the nodes are BB3, BB12, BB18, BB24, BB25. The edges are from BB3 to BB12 and BB25, BB12 to BB18 and BB25, BB18 to BB24 and BB25, and BB24 to BB25.

I'll structure the dot file accordingly, making sure each node has the correct edges based on the branching in the IR code.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code, we identify each basic block and the branches between them. The function checks three conditions sequentially, each corresponding to a basic block. The graph shows the flow from the entry block through each condition check to the exit block.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    BB3[label="BB3"];
    BB12[label="BB12"];
    BB18[label="BB18"];
    BB24[label="BB24"];
    BB25[label="BB25"];

    BB3 -> BB12[label="cond1 false"];
    BB3 -> BB25[label="cond1 true"];

    BB12 -> BB18[label="cond2 false"];
    BB12 -> BB25[label="cond2 true"];

    BB18 -> BB24[label="cond3 false"];
    BB18 -> BB25[label="cond3 true"];

    BB24 -> BB25;
}
```
