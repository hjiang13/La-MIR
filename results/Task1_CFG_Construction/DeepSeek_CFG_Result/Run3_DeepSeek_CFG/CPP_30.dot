Alright, I need to generate a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format based on the provided IR code. The user has given me a detailed IR code snippet and wants a graph that shows the nodes (basic blocks) and edges (control flow) without listing the content of each blockâ€”just their titles.

First, I'll start by identifying all the basic blocks in the IR code. Each basic block is labeled with a number, like 2, 12, 22, etc. I'll list these labels as nodes in the DOT file.

Next, I'll analyze the control flow between these blocks. The IR code uses branch instructions (like br) and labels to indicate where the control flows. For example, after block 2, there's a branch to either block 88 or block 12, depending on the condition. I'll represent these transitions as directed edges in the graph.

I'll go through each block sequentially, noting the possible transitions. For instance, block 12 has a phi instruction indicating it can come from block 2 or block 76. Similarly, block 22 can go to block 26 or block 24, and so on.

I need to ensure that all possible paths are captured. Some blocks, like block 76, have multiple predecessors and can loop back to block 12, creating a loop structure. I'll represent this with an edge from 76 back to 12.

For exception handling blocks, like those starting with label 66 or 68, I'll connect them appropriately, usually leading to block 70, which then decides whether to resume or unwind.

Finally, I'll structure all these nodes and edges into a DOT file, making sure each node is correctly labeled and each edge represents a valid control flow path. I'll review the graph to ensure it's accurate and complete, covering all blocks and their transitions.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];

    2[label="2"];
    12[label="12"];
    22[label="22"];
    24[label="24"];
    26[label="26"];
    32[label="32"];
    33[label="33"];
    34[label="34"];
    43[label="43"];
    46[label="46"];
    49[label="49"];
    54[label="54"];
    57[label="57"];
    60[label="60"];
    62[label="62"];
    66[label="66"];
    68[label="68"];
    70[label="70"];
    73[label="73"];
    75[label="75"];
    76[label="76"];
    88[label="88"];

    2 -> 88;
    2 -> 12;

    12 -> 22;
    12 -> 76;

    22 -> 24;
    22 -> 26;

    24 -> 76;

    26 -> 32;
    26 -> 34;

    32 -> 33;

    33 -> 33;

    34 -> 43;
    34 -> 49;

    43 -> 46;
    43 -> 66;

    46 -> 49;

    49 -> 54;
    49 -> 57;

    54 -> 57;

    57 -> 60;
    57 -> 62;

    60 -> 62;

    62 -> 76;

    66 -> 70;

    68 -> 70;

    70 -> 75;
    70 -> 73;

    73 -> 75;

    75 -> 75;

    76 -> 12;
    76 -> 88;

    88 -> 88;
}
```

This dot file shows the control flow graph with nodes representing basic blocks and edges representing control flow between them. Each node is labeled with the block number, and edges represent possible control flow paths.
