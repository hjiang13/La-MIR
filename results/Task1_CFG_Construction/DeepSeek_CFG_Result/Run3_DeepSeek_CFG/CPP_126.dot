Okay, so I have this IR code for a function called is_sorted that takes a vector of integers and returns a boolean. I need to figure out the control flow graph for this function. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. The function starts with some setup where it's getting elements from the vector. It retrieves the end pointer, the data pointer, calculates the size by subtracting these pointers, and then right shifts by 2, which I think is because pointers are 8 bytes and the vector stores 4-byte integers, so dividing by 4 to get the number of elements.

Then there's an initial comparison. If the size is greater than 1, it branches to label 11; otherwise, it goes to label 32. So, the start is at the beginning, then it goes to either 11 or 32.

Looking at label 11, it loads the first element of the vector into %12 and then branches to label 13. Label 13 is a loop, it seems. It has a phi node for the current index and the value of the current element. It compares the current element with the previous one. If the current element is less than the previous, it branches to 32, which is the exit. Otherwise, it continues.

In label 19, it checks if the current index is beyond a certain point, or if the current and previous elements are equal. If either is true, it branches to label 23; otherwise, it continues the loop at label 29.

Label 23 seems to handle the case where elements might be equal. It adds a large number to the index, applies a mask (probably to handle overflow or wrap around), loads the next element, and checks if it's equal to the previous. If not, it goes to 32.

Label 29 increments the loop index and checks if it's reached the end. If so, it goes to 32; otherwise, it loops back to 13.

Label 32 is the exit point. It returns true if the loop completed without finding any out-of-order elements, otherwise false.

So, to map this out as a control flow graph:

- Start at the entry block (let's call it Entry).
- Entry branches to either Block11 or Block32 based on the initial size check.
- Block11 leads to Block13.
- Block13 has a loop that can go to Block19, Block23, Block29, or back to itself.
- Block19 can go to Block23 or Block29.
- Block23 leads to Block32.
- Block29 can loop back to Block13 or go to Block32.
- Block32 is the exit.

I might have missed some details, but this seems to be the general flow. I think I can represent this as a dot file with nodes labeled Entry, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29, and 32, showing how they connect based on the branches.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code, we'll represent each basic block as a node and each control flow edge as a directed edge between these nodes. The CFG will show the flow of execution through the function based on the branches and labels present in the code.

Here is the CFG in dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Block11 [label="Block 11"];
    Block13 [label="Block 13"];
    Block19 [label="Block 19"];
    Block23 [label="Block 23"];
    Block29 [label="Block 29"];
    Block32 [label="Block 32"];
    
    Entry -> Block11 [label="if size > 1"];
    Entry -> Block32 [label="else"];
    
    Block11 -> Block13;
    
    Block13 -> Block19 [label="loop continues"];
    Block13 -> Block32 [label="loop exits"];
    
    Block19 -> Block23 [label="check elements"];
    Block19 -> Block29 [label="loop continues"];
    
    Block23 -> Block32 [label="exit due to condition"];
    
    Block29 -> Block13 [label="loop continues"];
    Block29 -> Block32 [label="loop exits"];
}
```

This CFG captures the control flow starting from the entry point, through the initial size check, and into the loop structure, highlighting the various paths the execution can take based on the conditions evaluated.
