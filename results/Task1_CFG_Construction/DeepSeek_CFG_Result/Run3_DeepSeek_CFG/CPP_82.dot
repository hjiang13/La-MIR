Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) from some given IR code. The function is called _Z12prime_lengthNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE, which sounds complicated, but I think it's just a C++ function that's been mangled. The goal is to translate this into a dot file showing the nodes and edges without listing the contents of each basic block, just their titles.

First, I need to understand the structure of the IR code provided. It's in LLVM IR format, which I'm somewhat familiar with. The function starts with some metadata about the module and target, which isn't too important for the CFG. The main part is the function definition.

Looking at the function, I see it's a 'define' for a function returning an i1 (a boolean) and taking a pointer to a basic_string. There are several sections with comments indicating the start of basic blocks, like label %1, %6, %8, etc. Each of these is a node in the CFG.

I'll go through each line and note the labels and control flow instructions like 'br' (branch). The first line after the function is %2 = getelementptr, but the labels start at 1. So, the entry block is %1.

The first branch is at line %5: br i1 %5, label %18, label %6. So from %1, if %5 is true, it goes to %18, else to %6.

Then in block %6, there's another branch: br i1 %7, label %18, label %8. So from %6, if %7 is true, go to %18, else to %8.

Block %8 starts with a phi instruction, which indicates the start of a loop. The phi node combines values from different predecessors. Then there's a compute of %10 as %4 modulo %9, and %11 checks if it's zero. Then %12 is %9 +1, %13 is %12 squared, and %14 checks if %13 > %4. The select instruction chooses between true and %14 based on %11, and then a branch to %16 or back to %8.

So block %8 has a loop back to itself, which means it's a loop body. The branch is controlled by the select result.

Block %16 is exited with a branch to %18, setting %17 as the negation of %11.

Block %18 is the exit block, where the function returns %19, which is a phi of the results from different paths.

Putting this all together, the nodes are %1, %6, %8, %16, %18. The edges are based on the branches:

- From %1, if condition is true, go to %18, else go to %6.
- From %6, if condition is true, go to %18, else go to %8.
- From %8, the loop continues back to itself, or exits to %16 if the condition is met.
- From %16, it goes to %18.
- %18 is the exit.

I think I've got all the connections right. Now I'll translate this into a dot file with the nodes and edges labeled appropriately. Each node is represented as a block, and edges show the flow between them.

To visualize the control flow graph (CFG) of the given IR code, we can represent it using a DOT file. Below is the DOT file that describes the CFG.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    start [label="1"];
    node6 [label="6"];
    node8 [label="8"];
    node16 [label="16"];
    node18 [label="18"];

    start -> node6 [label="false"];
    start -> node18 [label="true"];

    node6 -> node8 [label="false"];
    node6 -> node18 [label="true"];

    node8 -> node8 [label="loop"];
    node8 -> node16 [label="exit loop"];

    node16 -> node18;

    node18 [color=red, fillcolor=red];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**:
   - Each node (1, 6, 8, 16, 18) represents a basic block in the function.
   - Node 18 is colored red to indicate it's the exit block.

2. **Edges**:
   - Edges represent control flow between blocks.
   - Labels on edges indicate the condition leading to the next block.

This DOT file can be used with tools like Graphviz to render the CFG visually.
