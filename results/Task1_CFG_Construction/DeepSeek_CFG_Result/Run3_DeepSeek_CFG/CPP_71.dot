Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user has provided an IR (Intermediate Representation) code and wants me to generate a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT file format. The CFG should include nodes representing basic blocks and edges showing the control flow between them. Each node should only display its title, not the contents of the basic blocks.

First, I need to understand the structure of the provided IR code. It's written in LLVM IR, which I'm familiar with. The function in question is `_Z13triangle_areafff`, which takes three float arguments and returns a float. The code begins with some target and function attributes, which I can mostly ignore for constructing the CFG.

Next, I'll parse the IR code to identify the basic blocks. In LLVM IR, each basic block starts with a label, like `12:` or `24:`. The code has two main blocks: the entry block (implicitly labeled as the function's starting point) and then blocks 12 and 24.

Looking at the code, the function starts by performing some floating-point operations and comparisons. The key control flow points are the conditional branches. The first significant branch is at the end of the entry block, where `br i1 %11, label %12, label %24` decides whether to go to block 12 or block 24 based on the result of `%11`.

In block 12, there are more computations, and then it branches back to block 24 with `br label %24`. Block 24 is where the function returns, using a PHI node to select the return value based on whether it came from block 12 or the entry block.

So, the basic blocks are:
1. The entry block (let's call it "entry").
2. Block 12.
3. Block 24.

Now, mapping the control flow:
- The entry block branches to either block 12 or block 24.
- Block 12 always branches back to block 24.
- Block 24 is the exit point, so it doesn't branch anywhere else.

With this structure in mind, I'll construct the DOT file. Each node will be represented with a unique identifier and a label. Edges will show the flow between these nodes.

I need to ensure that the DOT syntax is correct. Each node is defined as `node_id [label="title"];` and edges as `node_id -> node_id;`. I'll also include a `rankdir` attribute set to "LR" to make the graph left-to-right, which is a common choice for CFGs.

Putting it all together, the DOT file will have three nodes and three edges, accurately representing the control flow of the function.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=LR;
    node0 [label="entry"];
    node1 [label="12"];
    node2 [label="24"];

    node0 -> node1;
    node0 -> node2;
    node1 -> node2;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph where:
- "entry" is the entry basic block
- "12" is the basic block labeled 12 in the IR code
- "24" is the basic block labeled 24 in the IR code
- Edges represent control flow between basic blocks

You can visualize this graph using any dot viewer, such as Graphviz.
