Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that a CFG represents the flow of a program's execution, showing the different basic blocks and how they connect through branches and jumps. Each node in the graph is a basic block, and edges show the possible control flow between them.

Looking at the IR code provided, it's a function `_Z11count_up_toi` that returns a vector. The code has several labels, like `2`, `7`, `10`, `21`, etc. Each label marks the beginning of a basic block. My task is to identify these blocks and see how they connect.

I'll start by listing all the labels I see. They are: 2, 7, 10, 21, 25, 27, 29, 33, 38, 40, 42, 54, 57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 65, 73, 77, 79, 83, 85, 87, 94, 95, 98, 101.

Next, I need to determine the control flow between these blocks. I'll look for branch instructions like `br`, `invoke`, and `call` that transfer control to another label.

Starting from the beginning:

- The function starts at label `2`. From there, it checks if `%1 > 2` and branches to `7` if true, else to `94`.

So, the initial flow is 2 → 7 (if true) and 2 → 94 (if false).

Moving to label `7`, it branches to `10`.

So, 7 → 10.

Label `10` is a loop. It has a `phi` node, which suggests it's the start of a loop. The branch from `10` checks if `%18 == 0`, going to `25` if true, else to `21`.

Thus, 10 → 25 (if true) and 10 → 21 (if false).

Label `21` compares `%23 > %15` and branches to `57` if true, else to `42`.

So, 21 → 57 (if true) and 21 → 42 (if false).

Following `42`, it loops back to `42` if certain conditions are met, which means 42 has a self-loop.

From `42`, it eventually goes to `54`, which then branches to `87` if a condition is met, else back to `57`.

So, 42 → 54 → 57 or 54 → 87.

Back to label `25`, it checks if `%14 == %11` and goes to `29` if true, else to `27`.

Thus, 25 → 29 (if true) and 25 → 27 (if false).

Label `27` goes to `87`.

Label `29` calls `malloc` and then proceeds to `33`.

So, 29 → 33.

From `33`, it checks if `%13` is null, going to `40` if true, else to `38`.

Thus, 33 → 40 (if true) or 33 → 38 (if false).

Label `38` calls `free` and then goes to `40`.

So, 38 → 40.

Label `40` proceeds to `87`.

From `87`, it increments `%15` and checks if it's equal to `%1`, looping back to `10` if not, else going to `94`.

So, 87 → 10 (if true) and 87 → 94 (if false).

Continuing, label `57` checks `%14 == %12` and goes to `61` if true, else to `59`.

Thus, 57 → 61 (if true) or 57 → 59 (if false).

Label `59` goes to `87`.

Label `61` checks if `%18` is a specific value, going to `63` if true, else to `65`.

So, 61 → 63 (if true) or 61 → 65 (if false).

Label `63` throws an exception and is followed by `64`, which is unreachable.

Label `65` does some calculations, allocates memory, and then goes to `73`.

So, 65 → 73.

From `73`, it checks if `%18 > 0`, going to `77` if true, else to `79`.

Thus, 73 → 77 (if true) or 73 → 79 (if false).

Label `77` does a memmove and then goes to `79`.

So, 77 → 79.

Label `79` frees memory and goes back to `87`.

So, 79 → 87.

There are also exception handling blocks: `83`, `85`, `95`, `98`, `101`. These handle exceptions and cleanup, eventually resuming or propagating the exception.

Putting it all together, the CFG starts at `2`, splits based on the initial condition, and has several loops and conditional branches leading to various blocks, eventually exiting at `94`.

I think I've covered all the branches, so now I can represent this as a dot file with nodes and edges showing the control flow.

Here is the control flow graph represented as a dot file:

This dot file describes the control flow graph with nodes representing basic blocks and directed edges showing control flow between them. Each node is labeled with the corresponding basic block number from the IR code.
