Okay, so I need to analyze the provided IR code and create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. The user provided the IR code for a function named @_Z4modpii, which seems to be a modulo operation. My task is to identify the basic blocks and their connections without listing the contents of each block, just their labels.

First, I'll go through the IR code to identify each basic block. Each block starts with a label, like 2, 4, 8, etc. I'll note down each label and see where each block branches to.

Looking at the code:

- The function starts at label 2. It has a condition %3 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 0, which branches to label 4 if true, else to 21.

- Label 4: It computes some values and then checks %7 = icmp ult i32 %5, 3. If true, it goes to label 10, else to 8.

- Label 8: It computes %9 and then jumps to 23.

- Label 10: This is a merge point with PHI nodes. It checks %13 = icmp eq i32 %6, 0. If true, it goes to 21, else to 14.

- Label 14: Another loop with PHI nodes. It checks %20 = icmp eq i32 %19, 0. If true, it goes to 21, else loops back to 14.

- Label 21: The exit point where it returns %22.

- Label 23: It computes several values and loops back to itself or goes to 10 based on %35.

So, the basic blocks are: 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 21, 23.

Now, I'll map the edges between them:

- 2 -> 4 (if %3 is true)
- 2 -> 21 (if %3 is false)
- 4 -> 10 (if %7 is true)
- 4 -> 8 (if %7 is false)
- 8 -> 23
- 10 -> 21 (if %13 is true)
- 10 ->14 (if %13 is false)
- 14 ->21 (if %20 is true)
- 14 ->14 (loop back if %20 is false)
- 23 ->10 (if %35 is true)
- 23 ->23 (loop back if %35 is false)

I need to represent this in DOT format. Each node is a basic block, and edges show the control flow.

I'll start by defining the nodes and then connect them with edges based on the above mapping.

Wait, does the loop in 14 go back to itself? Yes, so there's an edge from 14 to 14.

Similarly, label 23 loops back to itself if the condition isn't met.

So, in the DOT file, each node will have edges to its successors.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the DOT file accordingly.

To create the control flow graph for the given IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their control flow. Here's the DOT file representation:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    label_2 [label="2"];
    label_4 [label="4"];
    label_8 [label="8"];
    label_10 [label="10"];
    label_14 [label="14"];
    label_21 [label="21"];
    label_23 [label="23"];
    
    label_2 -> label_4 [label="true"];
    label_2 -> label_21 [label="false"];
    
    label_4 -> label_10 [label="true"];
    label_4 -> label_8 [label="false"];
    
    label_8 -> label_23;
    
    label_10 -> label_21 [label="true"];
    label_10 -> label_14 [label="false"];
    
    label_14 -> label_21 [label="true"];
    label_14 -> label_14 [label="false"];
    
    label_23 -> label_10 [label="true"];
    label_23 -> label_23 [label="false"];
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between the basic blocks, with edges labeled by the conditions leading to each branch.
