Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. Let me start by understanding what a CFG is. It's a graphical representation of a program's control flow, showing the sequence of basic blocks and how they connect through branches.

Looking at the IR code, it's a function named `_Z9incr_listSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` which seems to be a C++ function. The code has several labels like 2, 11, 15, etc., which are the basic blocks.

First, I'll list out all the basic blocks. They are: 2, 11, 15, 22, 24, 51, 54, 65, 67, 69, 76. Each of these is a node in the CFG.

Next, I'll determine the edges by looking at the `br` instructions. For example, the first `br` goes from block 2 to either 69 or 11. So, there's an edge from 2 to 69 and another from 2 to 11.

Continuing this process, block 11 branches to 67 or 15, so edges from 11 to 67 and 11 to 15. Block 15 then goes to 51 or 22, so edges from 15 to 51 and 15 to 22.

Block 22 goes to 24, so an edge from 22 to 24. Block 24 loops back to itself or goes to 51, so edges from 24 to 24 and 24 to 51.

Block 51 goes to 65 or 54, so edges from 51 to 65 and 51 to 54. Block 54 goes to 65, so an edge from 54 to 65.

Block 65 goes to 69 or 67, so edges from 65 to 69 and 65 to 67. Block 67 goes to 76, so an edge from 67 to 76.

Block 76 loops on itself or goes to 69, so edges from 76 to 76 and 76 to 69. Finally, block 69 is the exit point.

Now, I'll structure this into a DOT file format, showing each node and the edges between them.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format, showing the nodes (basic blocks) and edges (control flow):

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    2[label="2"];
    11[label="11"];
    15[label="15"];
    22[label="22"];
    24[label="24"];
    51[label="51"];
    54[label="54"];
    65[label="65"];
    67[label="67"];
    69[label="69"];
    76[label="76"];
    
    2 -> 69;
    2 -> 11;
    
    11 -> 67;
    11 -> 15;
    
    15 -> 51;
    15 -> 22;
    
    22 -> 24;
    
    24 -> 24;
    24 -> 51;
    
    51 -> 65;
    51 -> 54;
    
    54 -> 65;
    
    65 -> 69;
    65 -> 67;
    
    67 -> 76;
    
    76 -> 76;
    76 -> 69;
    
    69 -> 69;
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph where each node is a basic block, and edges represent control flow between blocks.
