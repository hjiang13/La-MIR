Okay, so the user has given me an IR code and wants the control flow graph (CFG) in dot format. They mentioned that they don't need the content of each basic block, just the titles of the nodes and the edges connecting them. 

First, I need to parse the IR code to identify the basic blocks. Each block starts with a label, like '3:', '7:', '12:', etc. So, I'll look through the code and list each of these as nodes in the CFG.

Next, I have to determine the edges between these nodes. The IR uses branch instructions like 'br' to transfer control. For example, the first 'br' instruction branches to label %7 or %12 based on the condition %6. So, I'll note that node 3 has edges to nodes 7 and 12.

Looking further, node 7 has a 'ret' instruction, so it's an exit node. Node 12 has a 'br' that can loop back to itself or go to node 7. I'll make sure to represent that loop correctly.

I'll structure the dot file with each node as a circle and edges as directed lines. I'll also include comments to indicate possible loops, like the one between node 12 and itself.

Finally, I'll make sure the dot syntax is correct, using '->' for edges and 'label' for node identifiers. I'll test the dot code to ensure it renders properly without any syntax errors.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape = circle];
    
    start [label="3"];
    node7 [label="7"];
    node12 [label="12"];
    
    start -> node7 [label="br %6"];
    start -> node12 [label="br %6"];
    
    node7 -> node12 [label="br"];
    node12 -> node7 [label="br %20"];
    node12 -> node12 [label="br %20"];  // Loop back
    
    // node7 is the return node
    node7 [style=filled, fillcolor=green];
    
    // node12 is the loop node
    node12 [style=filled, fillcolor=yellow];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with the following properties:
- Nodes are represented as circles
- Node 7 is highlighted in green to indicate it is the return/exit node
- Node 12 is highlighted in yellow to indicate it is part of a loop
- Edges represent control flow between nodes
- Comments indicate the type of control flow (e.g., "br %20" indicates a conditional branch)

You can visualize this graph using any dot viewer or tool like Graphviz.
