Okay, I need to construct a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The function in question is @_Z15truncate_numberf, which takes a float and returns a float. 

First, I'll identify the basic blocks. In IR, basic blocks are sequences of instructions ending with a terminator like 'ret'. 

Looking at the code, the function starts with label %2, then %3, %4, and ends with ret. So, there's only one basic block because there are no branches or jumps.

The start node is the entry point of the function. From there, it executes the instructions in order. Since there are no conditional branches, the flow is straightforward, leading directly to the return statement.

So, the CFG will have a single node representing the basic block, connected from the start node to this block, and then to the exit node.

I'll structure the dot file with nodes for start, the basic block, and exit. Edges will show the flow from start to the block and then to exit.

To analyze the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided IR code, we first identify the basic blocks and their connections. The given IR code represents a function with a single basic block, as there are no branching statements.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: The function @_Z15truncate_numberf contains a single basic block because there are no control flow changing instructions like branches or jumps.

2. **Construct the CFG**: 
   - The graph starts with a "start" node.
   - This connects to the basic block of the function.
   - The basic block then connects to an "exit" node, as the function terminates after executing all instructions.

Here is the CFG in dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];
    
    start -> BB;
    BB -> exit;
}
```

This graph shows the flow from the start of the function to the single basic block and then to the exit. Each node represents a stage in the control flow without any conditional branching.
