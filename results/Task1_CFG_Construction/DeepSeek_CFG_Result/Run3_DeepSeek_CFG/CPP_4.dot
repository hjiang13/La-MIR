Alright, so I have this IR code for a function called mean_absolute_deviation, and I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for it. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that a CFG represents the flow of control through a program, showing the different basic blocks and how they connect. Each basic block is a sequence of instructions without any branches or labels, and edges represent possible control flow between these blocks.

Looking at the IR code, it's structured with labels that seem to mark the beginning of basic blocks. The function starts at label 1, which is the entry point. From there, it computes some addresses and checks if %8 is zero. If it is, it branches to label 11; otherwise, it goes to label 13.

So, the first node is label 1, which branches to 11 and 13. Label 11 seems to handle the case where the vector is empty, returning zero. Then it branches to label 129, which is the exit point.

Label 13 is more complex. It calculates some values and then checks if %15 is less than 7. If true, it goes to 58; otherwise, it goes to 18. So, from 13, there are two edges: to 58 and to 18.

Label 18 initializes some variables for a loop. It branches to label 20, which is a loop that processes elements in chunks of 8. The loop has phi nodes for variables, which means it's updating some state each iteration. After processing, it checks if %56 is zero. If not, it loops back to 20; otherwise, it exits to 58.

Label 58 handles the remaining elements after the loop. It checks if %16 is zero. If so, it goes to 73; otherwise, it branches to 63. Wait, no, looking closer, label 58 actually has a phi node for %59, %60, and %61, and then checks %62. If true, it goes to 73; otherwise, it goes to 63.

Label 63 is another loop that processes the remaining elements one by one. It increments the index and checks if it has reached the end, looping back if not, otherwise exiting to 73.

Label 73 is where the final computation happens. It divides the accumulated sum by the count and then checks if the initial condition was zero. If so, it returns the result; otherwise, it proceeds to label 77.

Label 77 checks another condition and branches to 112 if true, or 80 if false. Label 80 is another loop processing elements in chunks of 4, similar to the earlier loop. After processing, it goes to 112.

Label 112 then checks if %78 is zero. If so, it returns the result; otherwise, it goes to 117, which is another loop processing the remaining elements one by one.

Finally, label 129 is where the function returns the result.

Putting all these together, I need to represent each label as a node and draw edges based on the control flow. I'll make sure the edges correctly represent the flow, including loops and conditional branches. Each node will just have its label as the title, without the detailed instructions inside.

I think I've got the structure, so I'll now represent this as a dot file, showing all the nodes and their connections.

Here is the control flow graph represented in dot format, showing the basic blocks and their connections:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"];
    11[label="11"];
    13[label="13"];
    18[label="18"];
    20[label="20"];
    58[label="58"];
    63[label="63"];
    73[label="73"];
    77[label="77"];
    80[label="80"];
    82[label="82"];
    112[label="112"];
    117[label="117"];
    129[label="129"];

    1 -> 11;
    1 -> 13;

    11 -> 129;

    13 -> 58;
    13 -> 18;

    18 -> 20;

    20 -> 20;
    20 -> 58;

    58 -> 58;
    58 -> 63;
    58 -> 73;

    63 -> 63;
    63 -> 73;

    73 -> 73;
    73 -> 77;
    73 -> 129;

    77 -> 112;
    77 -> 80;

    80 -> 82;

    82 -> 82;
    82 -> 112;

    112 -> 112;
    112 -> 117;
    112 -> 129;

    117 -> 117;
    117 -> 129;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with nodes as basic blocks and edges as control flow transitions. Each node is labeled with its corresponding basic block number, and edges show the possible flow between these blocks.
