Okay, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The user wants it in DOT file format, showing nodes and edges without the detailed content of each basic blockâ€”just the labels.

First, I'll identify all the basic blocks in the IR code. Each label (like 3, 10, 12, 19) represents a basic block. So, the nodes in the CFG will be these labels.

Next, I'll look at the branching instructions to determine the edges between nodes. The 'br' instruction tells me where each block can go. For example, the first 'br' goes from the start to either block 10 or 3, depending on the condition.

I'll go through each block one by one:

1. The initial block (implicitly before label 3) has a 'br' to either 10 or 3.
2. Block 3 has a 'br' that can loop back to itself or go to 19.
3. Block 10 is an exit block with a 'ret' instruction.
4. Block 12 has a 'br' that can loop back to itself or go to 19.
5. Block 19 has a 'br' that can go back to 3 or exit to 10.

I'll draw edges based on these possible jumps, making sure each possible path is represented in the DOT file. The edges will be directed arrows between the nodes.

I'll structure the DOT file with nodes as circles and edges as arrows, using the labels as node names. I'll also add comments for clarity.

Now, putting it all together, I'll write the DOT file with the nodes and edges as per the control flow.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT file format for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    // Define nodes
    start [label="start"];
    node3 [label="3"];
    node10 [label="10"];
    node12 [label="12"];
    node19 [label="19"];
    
    // Define edges
    start -> node3 [label="br"];
    start -> node10 [label="br"];
    
    node3 -> node12 [label="br"];
    node3 -> node19 [label="br"];
    
    node10 -> node3 [label="phi"];
    node10 -> node19 [label="phi"];
    
    node12 -> node3 [label="br"];
    node12 -> node19 [label="br"];
    
    node19 -> node3 [label="br"];
    node19 -> node10 [label="br"];
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph of the given IR code. Each node represents a basic block in the code, and edges represent the possible control flow paths between these blocks. The nodes are labeled with their corresponding basic block numbers.
