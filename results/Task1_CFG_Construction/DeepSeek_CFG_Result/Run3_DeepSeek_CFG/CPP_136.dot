Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I remember that a CFG represents the flow of control through a program, with nodes as basic blocks and edges as possible control transfers between them.

First, I need to parse the IR code to identify all the basic blocks. Each basic block starts with a label, like '2', '11', '14', etc., and ends just before the next label or the end of the function. So, I'll go through the code and list out all these labels as nodes in the CFG.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these nodes. Edges are determined by the control flow instructions, such as 'br' (branch), 'ret' (return), etc. For each 'br' instruction, I'll look at the destination label and create an edge from the current block to that destination.

Looking at the provided IR code, I'll start from the entry block, which is block '2' (the first block after the function definition). From there, the code has a 'br' instruction that goes to either block '14' or '11' based on a condition. So, I'll add edges from block '2' to both '14' and '11'.

Then, in block '11', there's a 'br' to block '28'. So, an edge from '11' to '28' is added. Block '14' has a 'br' to itself (a loop?), so that's a self-edge. Wait, actually, looking closer, block '14' has a 'phi' node, which suggests it's part of a loop, so it might branch back to itself or to another block.

Continuing through the code, block '28' has a 'br' to either '35' or '40' based on another condition. So, edges from '28' to '35' and '40'. Then, block '35' branches to '47', block '40' has a 'br' to '47' as well, and block '42' also branches to '47'. Block '47' then branches back to '28' or to '14', creating loop structures.

Block '14' eventually returns, so it has an edge to 'ret' which is an exit node.

I also notice that some blocks like '35', '40', '42', '47' are part of loops, so their edges form cycles in the CFG. It's important to correctly represent these loops to accurately show the control flow.

Putting it all together, I'll map out each block and its possible transitions, ensuring all edges are correctly identified and represented in the graph.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: Each label in the IR code represents the start of a basic block. List all these labels as nodes in the CFG.

2. **Determine Control Flow Edges**: Examine each `br` instruction to determine the control flow between blocks. Each destination label of a `br` instruction becomes an edge from the current block to that destination.

3. **Handle Special Cases**: Note any loops or self-edges, such as block '14' branching back to itself or to other blocks within a loop structure.

Here is the CFG represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    // Basic blocks as nodes
    "2" [label="2"];
    "11" [label="11"];
    "14" [label="14"];
    "28" [label="28"];
    "35" [label="35"];
    "40" [label="40"];
    "42" [label="42"];
    "47" [label="47"];
    "ret" [label="ret"];
    
    // Edges between nodes
    "2" -> "14";
    "2" -> "11";
    "11" -> "28";
    "14" -> "14";
    "14" -> "ret";
    "28" -> "35";
    "28" -> "40";
    "35" -> "47";
    "40" -> "47";
    "42" -> "47";
    "47" -> "28";
    "47" -> "14";
}
```
