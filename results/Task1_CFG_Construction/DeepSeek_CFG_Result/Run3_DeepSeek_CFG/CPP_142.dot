Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm not super familiar with LLVM IR, but I know a bit about control flow graphs. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the structure of the IR code provided. It looks like it's a function called `_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which probably translates to `sum_squares` taking a vector of integers. The function is supposed to compute the sum of squares of the elements in the vector.

Looking at the code, I see several labels: 1, 10, 13, 15, 21, 25, 30, 33. These are the basic blocks. Each block starts with a label and contains some instructions. My goal is to represent the flow between these blocks as edges in a graph.

I'll start by listing all the basic blocks:

1. Block 1
2. Block 10
3. Block 13
4. Block 15
5. Block 21
6. Block 25
7. Block 30
8. Block 33

Next, I need to determine the edges between these blocks. I'll go through each block and see where it branches to.

Starting with Block 1:
- It ends with a branch instruction: `br i1 %9, label %13, label %10`. So, if condition %9 is true, it goes to Block 13; otherwise, it goes to Block 10. So, edges from Block 1 to Block 13 and Block 10.

Block 10:
- Ends with `br label %15`. So, it unconditionally goes to Block 15. Edge from Block 10 to Block 15.

Block 13:
- Ends with `ret i32 %14`. This is an exit point, so no outgoing edges.

Block 15:
- Ends with `br i1 %20, label %21, label %25`. So, conditionally goes to Block 21 or Block 25. Edges from Block 15 to Block 21 and Block 25.

Block 21:
- Ends with `br label %33`. Goes to Block 33. Edge from Block 21 to Block 33.

Block 25:
- Ends with `br i1 %27, label %30, label %33`. So, conditionally goes to Block 30 or Block 33. Edges from Block 25 to Block 30 and Block 33.

Block 30:
- Ends with `br label %33`. Goes to Block 33. Edge from Block 30 to Block 33.

Block 33:
- Ends with `br i1 %37, label %13, label %15`. So, conditionally goes back to Block 13 or loops back to Block 15. This creates edges from Block 33 to Block 13 and Block 15.

Putting this all together, the CFG should show all these connections. Each block is a node, and edges represent possible control flow paths.

I should also note that Block 33 loops back to Block 15, indicating a loop structure in the code. This makes sense for summing elements, as you'd iterate through the vector.

So, the final CFG will have all these blocks connected as per the branches I identified.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their control flow transitions. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: The IR code contains the following basic blocks: 1, 10, 13, 15, 21, 25, 30, 33.

2. **Determine Control Flow**:
   - **Block 1**: Branches to Block 13 (if condition true) and Block 10 (if condition false).
   - **Block 10**: Unconditionally branches to Block 15.
   - **Block 13**: Exits the function, no outgoing edges.
   - **Block 15**: Branches to Block 21 (if condition true) and Block 25 (if condition false).
   - **Block 21**: Unconditionally branches to Block 33.
   - **Block 25**: Branches to Block 30 (if condition true) and Block 33 (if condition false).
   - **Block 30**: Unconditionally branches to Block 33.
   - **Block 33**: Branches to Block 13 (if condition true) and loops back to Block 15 (if condition false).

3. **Construct the CFG**: Represent each block as a node and draw directed edges based on the control flow transitions.

Here's the CFG in Graphviz (dot) format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    Block1[label="1"];
    Block10[label="10"];
    Block13[label="13"];
    Block15[label="15"];
    Block21[label="21"];
    Block25[label="25"];
    Block30[label="30"];
    Block33[label="33"];
    
    Block1 -> Block13[label="Condition True"];
    Block1 -> Block10[label="Condition False"];
    
    Block10 -> Block15;
    
    Block13 -> Block13[label="Exit"];
    
    Block15 -> Block21[label="Condition True"];
    Block15 -> Block25[label="Condition False"];
    
    Block21 -> Block33;
    
    Block25 -> Block30[label="Condition True"];
    Block25 -> Block33[label="Condition False"];
    
    Block30 -> Block33;
    
    Block33 -> Block13[label="Condition True"];
    Block33 -> Block15[label="Condition False"];
}
```

This CFG accurately represents the control flow of the given IR code, showing all possible execution paths between the basic blocks.
