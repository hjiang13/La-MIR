Okay, so I need to figure out the control flow graph for this given IR code. Let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided an IR code snippet and want a control flow graph in dot file format, showing nodes and edges without the content of each basic block, just the titles.

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. It's a module with a function called _Z18car_race_collisioni which takes an i32 parameter and returns an i32. The function seems simple: it multiplies the input by itself and returns the result. 

Looking at the code, the function starts with a label, then there's a multiply instruction, and finally a return. In terms of basic blocks, each of these is a single basic block because there are no control flow instructions like branches or jumps. The function starts at the entry block, does the multiplication, and then exits by returning.

So, the control flow graph should have three nodes: the entry block, the multiply instruction, and the return instruction. The edges would show the flow from one block to the next. Since there are no conditionals or loops, the graph is linear.

Wait, actually, in IR, each basic block is typically labeled with a percentage sign, like %2 here. But in this case, there's only one basic block because the entire function is a straight line without any branching. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, no. The function only has one basic block. It starts, multiplies, and returns. So the CFG would just have one node representing the entire function, with no edges since there's no control flow change.

But the user wants nodes for each basic block. Since this function is a single basic block, the CFG would have just one node. So the dot file would show that single node without any edges.

I think that's the correct approach. The function doesn't have multiple basic blocks, so the control flow graph is straightforward with only one node.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we analyze the structure of the code. The function `_Z18car_race_collisioni` contains a single basic block with no control flow changes, as it simply performs a multiplication and returns the result. Therefore, the CFG consists of one node representing the entire function.

Here's the dot file representation:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    start[label="Function Entry"];
}
```

This dot file shows a single node labeled "Function Entry," indicating that the function has only one basic block with no control flow edges.
