Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. I'm not super familiar with LLVM IR, but I know that a CFG shows the flow of control through a program, like how functions call each other and how the program branches based on conditions.

First, I need to understand the structure of the IR code provided. It looks like it's a function called @_Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE, which probably translates to a function that computes a rolling maximum on a vector. The function takes two vector arguments, modifies the first one, and returns it.

Looking at the code, I see several labels like %2, %12, %13, etc. Each of these labels represents a basic block in the CFG. A basic block is a sequence of instructions without any branching, so each time the control flow branches (like an if statement or a loop), a new basic block starts.

The code starts at label %2, which is the entry point. From there, it initializes some memory with memset. Then it loads some pointers from the input vectors, compares them, and branches to either label %12 or %13 based on the comparison result.

Label %12 is an exit point with a ret instruction, meaning if the condition is met, the function returns immediately. If not, it goes to label %13, which seems to handle more complex logic, possibly a loop since there's a phi instruction indicating variables are being updated each iteration.

In label %13, there are several phi nodes, which suggests that this is a loop header where variables are being updated based on values from the previous iteration. The code then loads some values, does a comparison, and branches again. This pattern continues with various labels handling different parts of the logic, including memory management (like calling malloc and free), and loop control.

There's a loop that seems to iterate over elements, updating maximum values and moving pointers. The loop has a back edge from label %66 back to %13, indicating that the loop continues until some condition is no longer met.

There are also exception handling blocks, like labels %78 and %80, which manage errors if memory allocation fails. These blocks will jump to label %82 for cleanup if an exception occurs.

Putting this all together, the CFG starts at %2, branches to either exit at %12 or enter the main logic at %13. The main logic includes loops, condition checks, and exception handling, all of which contribute to the nodes and edges in the graph.

I need to represent each label as a node and each branch as a directed edge between nodes. The entry node is %2, and the exit node is %12. The other nodes represent the different stages of the function's execution, including loop bodies and exception handling.

So, the final CFG should show all these nodes connected based on how control flows through the function. Each node is labeled with its corresponding IR label, and edges show possible paths of execution.

Here's the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code in dot language format. Each node represents a basic block labeled with its corresponding IR label. Edges indicate control flow between blocks.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    // Nodes
    start [label="2"];
    node12 [label="12"];
    node13 [label="13"];
    node26 [label="26"];
    node28 [label="28"];
    node34 [label="34"];
    node35 [label="35"];
    node36 [label="36"];
    node45 [label="45"];
    node48 [label="48"];
    node50 [label="50"];
    node54 [label="54"];
    node57 [label="57"];
    node60 [label="60"];
    node62 [label="62"];
    node66 [label="66"];
    node78 [label="78"];
    node80 [label="80"];
    node82 [label="82"];
    node85 [label="85"];
    node87 [label="87"];

    // Edges
    start -> node12 [label="ret"];
    start -> node13 [label=""];
    
    node13 -> node26 [label=""];
    node13 -> node28 [label=""];
    
    node26 -> node66 [label=""];
    
    node28 -> node34 [label=""];
    node28 -> node36 [label=""];
    
    node34 -> node35 [label=""];
    
    node35 -> node35 [label="unreachable"];
    
    node36 -> node45 [label=""];
    node36 -> node50 [label=""];
    
    node45 -> node48 [label=""];
    
    node48 -> node50 [label=""];
    
    node50 -> node54 [label=""];
    node50 -> node57 [label=""];
    
    node54 -> node57 [label=""];
    
    node57 -> node60 [label=""];
    node57 -> node62 [label=""];
    
    node60 -> node62 [label=""];
    
    node62 -> node66 [label=""];
    
    node66 -> node13 [label=""];
    node66 -> node12 [label=""];
    
    node78 -> node82 [label=""];
    node80 -> node82 [label=""];
    
    node82 -> node85 [label=""];
    node82 -> node87 [label=""];
    
    node85 -> node87 [label=""];
    
    node87 -> node87 [label="resume"];
}
