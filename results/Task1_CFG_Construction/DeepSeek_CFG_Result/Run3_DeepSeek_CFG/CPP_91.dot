Okay, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. Let me start by understanding the structure of the code.

First, I'll identify the basic blocks. Each label in the IR corresponds to a basic block. So, I look for all the labels: 1, 5, 10, 12, 18, 24, 26, 41, 42, 58, 59.

Next, I determine the edges between these blocks. I'll look at the 'br' instructions to see where each block branches to.

- Block 1 has a 'br' to either 24 or 5, so edges from 1 to 24 and 1 to 5.
- Block 5 branches to 10 or 12, so edges from 5 to 10 and 5 to 12.
- Block 10 goes to 26, so an edge from 10 to 26.
- Block 12 can go to 24 or 18, so edges from 12 to 24 and 12 to 18.
- Block 18 goes to 24, so an edge from 18 to 24.
- Block 24 is an exit point, so no outgoing edges.
- Block 26 has a 'switch' that goes to 41, and also loops back to 26 in some cases. So edges from 26 to 41 and from 26 to itself.
- Block 41 goes to 42, so an edge from 41 to 42.
- Block 42 can go to 59 or loop back via 58, so edges from 42 to 59 and 42 to 58.
- Block 58 goes to 59, so an edge from 58 to 59.
- Block 59 can loop back to 12 or 26, so edges from 59 to 12 and 59 to 26.

I also need to make sure all blocks are included and edges are correctly represented. Now, I'll structure this into a dot file, showing each node and its edges without detailing the block contents.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their respective control flow edges. Each label in the IR represents a basic block, and the branches ('br') determine the edges between these blocks.

### Control Flow Graph Representation

Here is the CFG in dot file format, showing each basic block as a node and the control flow edges:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"];
    5[label="5"];
    10[label="10"];
    12[label="12"];
    18[label="18"];
    24[label="24"];
    26[label="26"];
    41[label="41"];
    42[label="42"];
    58[label="58"];
    59[label="59"];

    1 -> 24;
    1 -> 5;
    5 -> 10;
    5 -> 12;
    10 -> 26;
    12 -> 24;
    12 -> 18;
    18 -> 24;
    24 -> 24;
    26 -> 41;
    26 -> 26;
    41 -> 42;
    42 -> 59;
    42 -> 58;
    58 -> 59;
    59 -> 12;
    59 -> 26;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the IR code, labeled with their respective numbers.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent the control flow between basic blocks. For example, an edge from node 1 to node 5 indicates that execution can flow from block 1 to block 5.

This graph visualizes the program's control flow, making it easier to understand the execution paths and potential loops or conditional branches.
