Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, I know that a CFG represents the flow of a program's execution. Each node in the graph is a basic block, which is a sequence of instructions without any control flow changes (like branches or loops). Edges between nodes represent possible control flow between these blocks.

Looking at the IR code provided, it's a function named `_Z18has_close_elementsSt6vectorIfSaIfEEf`. The function has several labels like 2, 12, 14, 17, 23, 26, 28, and 36. Each of these labels represents the start of a basic block.

I'll start by identifying each basic block. The function begins at label 2, which is the entry point. From there, it checks if `%11` is true. If it is, it branches to label 36; otherwise, it goes to label 12. So, node 2 has edges to nodes 36 and 12.

Next, at label 12, it calls `llvm.umax.i64` and then branches to label 17. So, node 12 only goes to node 17.

Label 14 is a bit more complex. It seems to be part of a loop, as it has a loop instruction. It increments `%15` and checks if `%21` equals `%13`. Depending on that, it either goes to label 36 or back to 17. So, node 14 has edges to nodes 36 and 17.

At label 17, there's a phi instruction, which suggests it's a merge point for values from different paths. It then checks if `%22` is true, branching to 23 if true, otherwise to 14. So, node 17 has edges to 23 and 14.

Label 23 loads a float value and branches to 28. So, node 23 only goes to node 28.

Label 26 is another loop-related block. It checks if `%27` is true and branches to 28 or 14. So, node 26 has edges to 28 and 14.

Label 28 is where the loop condition is checked again. It calculates `%34` and branches to 36 if true, otherwise back to 26. So, node 28 has edges to 36 and 26.

Finally, label 36 is the exit point where the function returns. So, node 36 has no outgoing edges.

Now, putting all these connections together, I can map out the edges between each node based on the branch instructions.

I might have missed some details or mixed up some connections, so I should double-check each label and its corresponding branches to ensure the edges are correct. It's important to accurately represent the flow, especially in loops and conditionals, to capture the program's behavior correctly.

To create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code, we first identify each basic block by its label and then determine the control flow between these blocks based on branch instructions. Here's the step-by-step CFG construction:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: Each label in the IR code represents a basic block. The labels present are 2, 12, 14, 17, 23, 26, 28, and 36.

2. **Determine Control Flow**:
   - **Block 2**: Branches to 36 if `%11` is true, otherwise to 12.
   - **Block 12**: Unconditionally branches to 17.
   - **Block 14**: Branches to 36 if `%16` is true, otherwise loops back to 17.
   - **Block 17**: Branches to 23 if `%22` is true, otherwise to 14.
   - **Block 23**: Unconditionally branches to 28.
   - **Block 26**: Branches to 28 if `%27` is true, otherwise continues the loop to 14.
   - **Block 28**: Branches to 36 if `%34` is true, otherwise loops back to 26.
   - **Block 36**: Exit point with no outgoing edges.

3. **Construct the CFG**: Represent each basic block as a node and draw directed edges based on the control flow determined.

Here is the CFG represented in dot language:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    2[label="2"];
    12[label="12"];
    14[label="14"];
    17[label="17"];
    23[label="23"];
    26[label="26"];
    28[label="28"];
    36[label="36"];

    2 -> 36;
    2 -> 12;

    12 -> 17;

    14 -> 36;
    14 -> 17;

    17 -> 23;
    17 -> 14;

    23 -> 28;

    26 -> 28;
    26 -> 14;

    28 -> 36;
    28 -> 26;
}
```

This CFG accurately captures the control flow of the given IR code, showing all possible execution paths between the basic blocks.
