Okay, I need to figure out how to construct the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The user has asked for a dot file format showing the nodes and edges without listing the content of each basic blockâ€”just the titles.

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. It's a function named _Z23greatest_common_divisorii, which calculates the greatest common divisor. The function has a few basic blocks labeled 3 and 11. The entry point is label 3, which is a loop.

I see that the function starts with a br instruction to label 3, so the entry node is 3. Inside block 3, there are phi nodes for %4 and %5, which suggests that this block is part of a loop. The block calculates whether %5 is less than %4 and then uses select instructions to choose between %5 and %4 for %7 and %8. It then computes the remainder of %8 divided by %7 into %9. There's an icmp to check if %9 is zero, and based on that, it either branches to label 11 or back to label 3.

Label 11 is the exit block, which returns the result %7.

So, the CFG will have two nodes: one for the loop (label 3) and one for the exit (label 11). The edges will show that the loop can go back to itself or proceed to the exit.

I need to represent this in dot language. The nodes will be named as their labels. The edges will show the possible control flow paths. Since the loop can either continue or exit, there's an edge from node 3 to itself (the loop) and another edge from node 3 to node 11 (the exit).

I'll structure the dot file with two nodes and two edges, ensuring that the edges are directed and labeled if necessary, but the user didn't specify edge labels, so I'll keep it simple.

I should make sure the dot syntax is correct: defining nodes with labels and edges with arrows. I'll test the structure to ensure there are no syntax errors.

Finally, I'll present the dot code, explaining the nodes and edges as per the user's request.

I'll help you construct the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The output will be in dot file format, showing the nodes and edges.

Here's the CFG for the IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    label_3 [label="3"];
    label_11 [label="11"];
    
    label_3 -> label_3 [label="loop"];
    label_3 -> label_11 [label="exit"];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with nodes labeled by their basic block labels. The edges represent the control flow between the blocks. In this case, we have:

1. A node for the loop body (label 3)
2. A node for the exit block (label 11)

The edges show:
- A loop edge from label 3 back to itself
- An exit edge from label 3 to label 11
