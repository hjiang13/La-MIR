Alright, so the user has provided a piece of IR code and wants me to generate a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. They mentioned that each node should just have its title, not the detailed content. 

First, I need to understand what the IR code is doing. It's a function called `string_xor` that takes three string arguments. The function seems to be performing some kind of string operation, possibly XORing two strings into the first one. 

Looking at the IR, I see several labels like 3, 16, 20, etc. Each label represents a basic block in the CFG. My task is to map out how these blocks connect to each other based on the branch instructions.

I'll start by identifying all the labels. The function starts at label 3, which is the entry point. From there, it goes to label 16 under certain conditions. Then, label 16 has a phi node, indicating that it's a merge point for different paths. 

Next, I'll trace each branch. For example, after label 16, there's a branch to either label 20 or label 57. Label 20 leads to more processing, and there's a loop that goes back to label 16 after some iterations. There are also exception handling blocks, like labels 39, 43, and 58, which I need to include in the CFG.

I need to make sure I capture all the edges correctly. Each branch instruction will create an edge from one node to another. For loops, like the one involving labels 16, 20, 35, 36, etc., I'll show the cycle properly.

Finally, I'll structure all these nodes and edges in DOT language, ensuring it's clear and accurately represents the control flow. I'll double-check to make sure I didn't miss any labels or edges, especially the exception handling parts which can be a bit tricky.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label_3[label="3"];
    label_16[label="16"];
    label_20[label="20"];
    label_35[label="35"];
    label_36[label="36"];
    label_37[label="37"];
    label_39[label="39"];
    label_43[label="43"];
    label_44[label="44"];
    label_45[label="45"];
    label_46[label="46"];
    label_48[label="48"];
    label_57[label="57"];
    label_58[label="58"];

    label_3 -> label_16;
    label_16 -> label_20;
    label_16 -> label_57;
    label_20 -> label_35;
    label_35 -> label_36;
    label_35 -> label_48;
    label_36 -> label_37;
    label_37 -> label_48;
    label_39 -> label_43;
    label_39 -> label_58;
    label_43 -> label_58;
    label_44 -> label_45;
    label_44 -> label_48;
    label_45 -> label_46;
    label_45 -> label_39;
    label_46 -> label_48;
    label_48 -> label_16;
    label_48 -> label_57;
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between the different basic blocks in the program. Each node represents a label in the IR code, and edges represent control flow between blocks. The graph captures the structure of loops, conditionals, and exception handling in the code.
