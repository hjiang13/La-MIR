Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The user has provided the IR in LLVM format and wants the output as a dot file showing the nodes and edges without the content of each basic block.

First, I need to parse the IR code to identify the basic blocks. Each basic block is a sequence of instructions ending with a branch or a return. The IR code has labels like %1, %2, etc., which are the basic blocks.

Looking at the code, the function starts with label %1, which is the entry point. It branches to label %2. So, the first node is %1, and it has an edge to %2.

Next, label %2 is a loop. It has phi nodes for variables %3, %4, and %5, which are computed based on the incoming edges from %1 and %19. Then, there's a call to llvm.assume, followed by some arithmetic and a branch to either %19 or %9 based on the comparison %8.

So, from %2, there are two edges: one to %19 and another to %9. I'll represent these as edges in the dot file.

Label %9 is another loop. It has phi nodes for %10 and starts a new loop. There's a loop here with edges back to %9 or proceeding to %17, depending on the condition %16. So, %9 has an edge to itself and another to %17.

Label %17 doesn't have any instructions except a branch back to %19. So, %17 only connects back to %19.

Label %19 is another loop with phi nodes for %20 and some computations leading to a branch back to %2 or proceeding to %24. So, %19 has edges to %2 and %24.

Finally, label %24 is the exit point where the function returns. So, it's a terminal node with no outgoing edges.

Putting it all together, the nodes are %1, %2, %9, %17, %19, and %24. The edges connect them based on the branches and control flow.

I'll structure the dot file accordingly, making sure each node is represented and edges show the possible control flow paths.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph cfg {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    1 [label="1"];
    2 [label="2"];
    9 [label="9"];
    17 [label="17"];
    19 [label="19"];
    24 [label="24"];

    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 19;
    2 -> 9;
    9 -> 9;
    9 -> 17;
    17 -> 19;
    19 -> 2;
    19 -> 24;
}
```

This dot file describes the control flow graph with nodes representing the basic blocks and edges representing the control flow between them. Each node is labeled with the basic block identifier from the IR code.
