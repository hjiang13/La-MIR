Okay, so I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that a CFG represents the flow of a program's execution. Each node in the graph is a basic block, which is a sequence of instructions without any branching. Edges represent possible control flow between these blocks.

Looking at the IR code, I see it's a function named @_Z10prod_signsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. The code has several labels like 10, 15, 17, etc., which are the basic blocks. My task is to figure out how these blocks are connected.

I'll start by identifying all the labels. The code has labels 10, 15, 17, 44, 51, 61, 65. So, there are seven basic blocks.

Next, I need to see how each block transitions to another. I'll check each block's terminator instruction, which is usually a branch or a return.

- Block 10 ends with a branch to 44 if a condition is false, else continues to 15.
- Block 15 starts a loop with block 17.
- Block 17 has a loop that continues back to 17 or exits to 44.
- Block 44 has a conditional branch to 61 if a condition is false, else goes to 51.
- Block 51 ends with a branch to 61.
- Block 61 leads to 65.
- Block 65 is the exit point, returning the result.

I might have missed some connections, so I'll double-check each block's terminator:

- Block 10: br i1 %14, label %44, label %15 → So, from 10, if %14 is true, go to 44; else go to 15.
- Block 15: br label %17 → So, 15 goes to 17.
- Block 17: br i1 %43, label %44, label %17 → If %43 is true, go to 44; else loop back to 17.
- Block 44: br i1 %50, label %61, label %51 → If %50 is true, go to 61; else go to 51.
- Block 51: br label %61 → Goes to 61.
- Block 61: br label %65 → Goes to 65.
- Block 65: ret i32 %66 → Exit.

Wait, I think I missed block 1. The initial block is before 10, labeled as the entry point. So, the function starts at block 1, which goes to block 10 or 65 based on a condition. Then, block 10 goes to 44 or 15, and so on.

So, putting it all together, the CFG starts at block 1, which branches to 10 or 65. Block 10 goes to 44 or 15. Block 15 goes to 17. Block 17 loops back or goes to 44. Block 44 goes to 51 or 61. Block 51 goes to 61. Block 61 goes to 65, which exits.

I think that's all the connections. Now, I'll represent this in a dot file with nodes and edges as described.

Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code represented in dot language:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    1 [label="1"];
    10 [label="10"];
    15 [label="15"];
    17 [label="17"];
    44 [label="44"];
    51 [label="51"];
    61 [label="61"];
    65 [label="65"];

    1 -> 10 [label="cond"];
    1 -> 65 [label="cond"];

    10 -> 44 [label="cond"];
    10 -> 15 [label="cond"];

    15 -> 17;
    
    17 -> 44 [label="cond"];
    17 -> 17 [label="loop"];

    44 -> 51 [label="cond"];
    44 -> 61 [label="cond"];

    51 -> 61;

    61 -> 65;
}
```

This graph shows all the basic blocks (nodes) and their connections (edges) based on control flow in the IR code.
