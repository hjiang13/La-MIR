Alright, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. Let me start by understanding the structure of the code.

The function is `_Z9is_nestedNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, which seems to check if a string has nested brackets or similar structures. 

First, I'll identify the basic blocks by their labels. The IR code has labels like 1, 5, 16, 21, 37, 39. Each of these represents a basic block in the CFG.

Next, I'll look at the control flow between these blocks. The code starts at label 1, which is the entry point. From there, it checks if `%3` is zero. If true, it branches to label 39; otherwise, it goes to label 5.

Label 5 is where the loop setup begins. It loads some values and checks if the first character is ']' or ']'. Then it proceeds to label 16.

Label 16 is the start of a loop. It uses a phi node to track the loop index and some counters. The loop continues until `%17` equals `%3`, at which point it exits to label 37.

Within the loop, label 21 processes each character in the string, updating counters based on whether a '[' or ']' is found. It then decides whether to continue the loop or exit based on some conditions.

Finally, label 37 and 39 handle the exit conditions, determining if the string is nested or not.

Putting this all together, I can map the flow between the blocks to construct the CFG in dot format.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code, we'll represent each basic block as a node and the control flow between them as directed edges. Below is the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    entry[ label="entry (1)" ];
    bb5[ label="bb5 (5)" ];
    bb16[ label="bb16 (16)" ];
    bb21[ label="bb21 (21)" ];
    bb37[ label="bb37 (37)" ];
    bb39[ label="bb39 (39)" ];

    entry -> bb5;
    entry -> bb39;

    bb5 -> bb16;

    bb16 -> bb21;
    bb16 -> bb37;

    bb21 -> bb16;
    bb21 -> bb37;

    bb37 -> bb39;
}
```

This dot file illustrates the control flow between the basic blocks of the given IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and each edge represents the control flow between them.
