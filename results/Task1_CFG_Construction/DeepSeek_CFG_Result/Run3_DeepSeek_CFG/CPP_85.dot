Okay, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The IR code is in LLVM format, and the function is `_Z3addSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`. 

First, I'll identify the basic blocks by looking for labels in the code. Each label marks the start of a new basic block. The labels I see are 1, 11, 16, 20, 67, 71, 75, 77. 

Next, I'll determine the edges between these blocks by examining the branch instructions. For example, after label 1, there's a branch to label 11 or 75. So, there's an edge from 1 to 11 and from 1 to 75.

Looking at label 11, it branches to 71 or 16. So, edges from 11 to 71 and 11 to 16.

Label 16 has a branch to 20, so an edge from 16 to 20.

Label 20 has a loop that branches back to itself or to 67. So, edges from 20 to 20 and 20 to 67.

Label 67 branches to 71 or 75. So, edges from 67 to 71 and 67 to 75.

Label 71 goes to 77, so an edge from 71 to 77.

Label 75 can be reached from 1, 67, and 77. So, edges from 75 to itself and from 77 to 75.

Label 77 loops back to itself or goes to 75. So, edges from 77 to 77 and 77 to 75.

Putting it all together, I can draw the CFG with these nodes and edges, ensuring each basic block is represented and all control flow paths are accounted for.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code, we first identify the basic blocks by their labels and then determine the edges based on the branching instructions.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: The IR code contains several labels that mark the beginning of basic blocks. These labels are: `1`, `11`, `16`, `20`, `67`, `71`, `75`, and `77`.

2. **Determine Control Flow Edges**: For each basic block, we look at the branching instructions to determine where control flows next.

   - **Block 1**: Branches to block `11` or `75`.
   - **Block 11**: Branches to block `71` or `16`.
   - **Block 16**: Branches to block `20`.
   - **Block 20**: Contains a loop that branches back to itself or to block `67`.
   - **Block 67**: Branches to block `71` or `75`.
   - **Block 71**: Branches to block `77`.
   - **Block 75**: Can be reached from block `1`, `67`, or `77`; it also has a self-loop.
   - **Block 77**: Contains a loop that branches back to itself or to block `75`.

3. **Construct the CFG**: Using the identified blocks and edges, we construct the CFG.

Here is the CFG represented in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    "1" -> "11";
    "1" -> "75";

    "11" -> "71";
    "11" -> "16";

    "16" -> "20";

    "20" -> "20";
    "20" -> "67";

    "67" -> "71";
    "67" -> "75";

    "71" -> "77";

    "75" -> "75";

    "77" -> "77";
    "77" -> "75";
}
```

This graph shows all the basic blocks as nodes and the control flow edges between them.
