Okay, I need to generate a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The user provided the IR in LLVM assembly format, and they want the output as a dot file showing nodes and edges without the detailed content of each basic block.

First, I should identify the basic blocks in the code. Each block starts with a label followed by a colon. Looking through the code, I see labels like 1, 11, 13, 17, 25, 27, 32, 38, 40, 47. So there are 10 basic blocks in total.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these blocks. This means figuring out where each block jumps to. I'll go through each block and see the 'br' instructions, which indicate branching.

Starting with block 1: It has a 'br' to block 47 if condition %10 is true, else it goes to block 11. So, block 1 has edges to 47 and 11.

Block 11 calls a function and then branches to block 17 unconditionally. So, an edge from 11 to 17.

Block 13 has a 'br' to 47 if condition %16 is true, else to 17. So edges from 13 to 47 and 13 to 17.

Block 17 uses 'phi' nodes, which means it's a merge point from multiple predecessors. It has a 'br' based on %24 to 27 or back to 13. So edges from 17 to 27 and 17 to 13.

Block 25 has a 'br' based on %31 to 27 or 13. So edges from 25 to 27 and 25 to 13.

Block 27 has a 'br' based on %31 to 32 or 13. So edges from 27 to 32 and 27 to 13.

Block 32 doesn't have any branching; it just goes to block 40. So edge from 32 to 40.

Block 38 has a 'br' based on %39 to 40 or 25. So edges from 38 to 40 and 38 to 25.

Block 40 has a 'br' based on %45 to 47 or loops back to 38. So edges from 40 to 47 and 40 to 38.

Block 47 is the exit block, so it doesn't have any outgoing edges.

I also need to make sure there are no other blocks and that all edges are correctly captured. It's important to represent each block as a node and draw the edges accurately to show the control flow.

Now, I'll structure this into a dot file, ensuring each node is labeled correctly and edges are properly connected.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"];
    11[label="11"];
    13[label="13"];
    17[label="17"];
    25[label="25"];
    27[label="27"];
    32[label="32"];
    38[label="38"];
    40[label="40"];
    47[label="47"];

    1 -> 47;
    1 -> 11;

    11 -> 17;

    13 -> 47;
    13 -> 17;

    17 -> 27;
    17 -> 13;

    25 -> 27;
    25 -> 13;

    27 -> 32;
    27 -> 13;

    32 -> 40;

    38 -> 40;
    38 -> 25;

    40 -> 47;
    40 -> 38;

    47 -> 47;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph, showing the basic blocks as nodes and the control flow edges between them.
