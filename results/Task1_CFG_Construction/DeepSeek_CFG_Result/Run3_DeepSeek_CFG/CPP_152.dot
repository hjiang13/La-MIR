Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I remember that a CFG represents the flow of control through a program, with nodes as basic blocks and edges as jumps between them.

First, I look through the IR code to identify the labels that mark the beginning of each basic block. In the code, I see labels like 3, 14, 29, 31, etc. Each of these labels is the start of a new basic block.

Next, I note the branching instructions that transfer control from one block to another. For example, the instruction `br i1 %13, label %91, label %14` means that if condition %13 is true, it branches to label 91; otherwise, it goes to label 14. This creates edges from block 3 to both 91 and 14.

I continue this process, mapping each branch and identifying the corresponding edges between blocks. For instance, after label 14, there's a `br` instruction that either goes to label 31 or 29, creating edges from 14 to both 31 and 29.

I also notice loops in the code, such as the one involving labels 14, 29, 69, and back to 14. This indicates a cycle in the CFG, which is important to represent accurately.

Finally, I ensure that all the blocks are connected correctly based on the branching instructions, and I structure the CFG accordingly, making sure to include all necessary nodes and edges without duplicating any.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we identify basic blocks and their control flow. Here's the CFG in dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    3[label="3"];
    14[label="14"];
    29[label="29"];
    31[label="31"];
    37[label="37"];
    38[label="38"];
    39[label="39"];
    48[label="48"];
    51[label="51"];
    53[label="53"];
    57[label="57"];
    60[label="60"];
    63[label="63"];
    65[label="65"];
    69[label="69"];
    81[label="81"];
    83[label="83"];
    85[label="85"];
    88[label="88"];
    90[label="90"];
    91[label="91"];

    3 -> 14;
    3 -> 91;

    14 -> 29;
    14 -> 31;

    29 -> 69;

    31 -> 37;
    31 -> 39;

    37 -> 38;

    39 -> 48;
    39 -> 53;

    48 -> 51;

    51 -> 53;

    53 -> 57;
    53 -> 60;

    57 -> 60;

    60 -> 63;
    60 -> 65;

    63 -> 65;

    65 -> 69;

    69 -> 14;
    69 -> 91;

    81 -> 85;

    83 -> 85;

    85 -> 88;
    85 -> 90;

    88 -> 90;

    90 -> 85;

    91 -> 3;
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between basic blocks, with edges representing possible execution paths. Each node is labeled with the corresponding basic block number.
