Okay, so I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. 

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. It's a function called @_Z17is_multiply_primei which takes an i32 argument and returns an i1. The code has several labels: 1, 3, 11, 14, 23. Each of these is a basic block. 

I'll start by identifying each basic block. The function starts at label 1, which is the entry point. From there, it branches to either label 11 or label 3 based on the comparison %2 = icmp slt i32 %0, 4. So, label 1 has two outgoing edges: one to 11 and one to 3.

Next, label 3 is a bit more complex. It has multiple predecessors: label 1 and label 23. It computes some values and then branches to either label 14 or back to label 23. So, label 3 will have edges to 14 and 23.

Label 11 is another basic block. It has predecessors label 1 and label 23. It checks if %12 equals 2 and returns the result. So, label 11 has an edge coming from 1 and 23, and it exits the function.

Label 14 has a loop. It has predecessors label 3 and itself (since it's a loop). It does some calculations and then branches back to itself or to label 23. So, label 14 will have edges to itself (a loop) and to 23.

Label 23 has predecessors label 14 and label 3. It updates some variables and then branches back to label 3 or to label 11. So, label 23 will have edges to 3 and 11.

I think that's all the labels. Now, to draw the CFG, I'll represent each label as a node and connect them based on the branches.

Wait, I should make sure I didn't miss any edges. Let me go through each basic block again:

- Label 1: branches to 11 and 3.
- Label 3: branches to 14 and 23.
- Label 11: exits, so no outgoing edges.
- Label 14: branches to itself (loop) and to 23.
- Label 23: branches back to 3 and to 11.

Yes, that seems correct. Now, I can represent this in a dot file format with nodes and edges as described.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their control flow. Here's the CFG represented in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"];
    3[label="3"];
    11[label="11"];
    14[label="14"];
    23[label="23"];

    1 -> 11;
    1 -> 3;

    3 -> 14;
    3 -> 23;

    11 -> 23;

    14 -> 14;
    14 -> 23;

    23 -> 3;
    23 -> 11;
}
```

This graph shows each basic block as a node and the control flow edges between them, accurately representing the program's flow.
