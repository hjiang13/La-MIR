Okay, so I'm trying to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. 

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. It's a function named @_Z15starts_one_endsi which takes an i32 parameter. The function has several basic blocks labeled from 1 to 57, but not all are present. 

I'll start by identifying each label and their corresponding instructions. Each label represents a basic block in the CFG. The blocks are connected by branches (br instructions) which determine the control flow.

Looking at the code, I see that the function starts at label 1, but in the given code, the first block is label 2. Wait, no, the first line inside the function is %2 = icmp slt i32 %0, 1, followed by a br instruction. So, the entry point is label 1, but it's not explicitly shown. So, I'll consider label 1 as the entry block.

From label 1, it branches to either label 57 or label 3 based on the comparison %2. So, label 1 has two outgoing edges: one to 57 and another to 3.

Next, label 3: it has a comparison %4 and branches to 57 or 5. So, from 3, edges to 57 and 5.

Label 5: another comparison %6, branching to 7 or 57. So edges from 5 to 7 and 57.

Label 7: here, it computes %8 and %9, then branches to 48 or 10. So, edges from 7 to 48 and 10.

Label 10: computes several values and then branches to 28 or 18. So, edges from 10 to 28 and 18.

Label 18: seems to be part of a loop. It branches to 20. So, edge from 18 to 20.

Label 20: a loop with phi nodes. It has a branch back to itself and to 28. So, edges from 20 to 20 (loop) and to 28.

Label 28: another loop. It has a branch to 42 or back to 34. So, edges from 28 to 42 and 34.

Label 34: a loop that branches back to itself and to 42. So, edges from 34 to 34 and 42.

Label 42: processes some data and then branches to 57 or 48. So, edges from 42 to 57 and 48.

Label 48: has a phi node and branches to 51. So, edge from 48 to 51.

Label 51: a loop that branches back to itself and to 57. So, edges from 51 to 51 and 57.

Finally, label 57: the exit block, where the function returns.

I need to make sure all the blocks are included. From the code, the blocks are: 1, 2 (entry), 3, 5, 7, 10, 18, 20, 28, 34, 42, 48, 51, 57.

Wait, in the code, the first block is labeled 2, so maybe 2 is the entry? Or is label 1 the entry? The function starts with 'define' and the first block is label 2. So perhaps label 2 is the entry, not label 1. That might be a mistake in my earlier thought.

So, correcting that, the entry is label 2, which then branches to 57 or 3. Then label 3 branches to 57 or 5, and so on.

I'll map all the blocks and their connections accordingly, ensuring each block's outgoing edges are correctly represented.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we identify each basic block and the branches (edges) between them. Here's the structured CFG:

1. **Block 2 (Entry Block)**
   - Branches to Block 57 or Block 3.

2. **Block 3**
   - Branches to Block 57 or Block 5.

3. **Block 5**
   - Branches to Block 7 or Block 57.

4. **Block 7**
   - Branches to Block 48 or Block 10.

5. **Block 10**
   - Branches to Block 28 or Block 18.

6. **Block 18**
   - Branches to Block 20.

7. **Block 20 (Loop)**
   - Branches back to itself (loop) or to Block 28.

8. **Block 28**
   - Branches to Block 42 or Block 34.

9. **Block 34 (Loop)**
   - Branches back to itself (loop) or to Block 42.

10. **Block 42**
    - Branches to Block 57 or Block 48.

11. **Block 48**
    - Branches to Block 51.

12. **Block 51 (Loop)**
    - Branches back to itself (loop) or to Block 57.

13. **Block 57 (Exit Block)**
    - Where the function returns.

This CFG shows the flow of control starting from Block 2, through various conditional branches and loops, ultimately leading to Block 57 where the function exits.
