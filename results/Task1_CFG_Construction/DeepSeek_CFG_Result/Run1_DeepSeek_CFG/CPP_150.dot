Okay, so I have to create a control flow graph (CFG) for this given IR code. Let's see, the code is in LLVM IR, and the function is _Z6x_or_yiii. The user wants the output in dot file format, showing nodes and edges without the contents of each basic blockâ€”just the titles.

First, I need to understand what each part of the IR code represents. The function has some parameters: i32 %0, %1, %2. Then there are several basic blocks starting with labels like 3, 7, 12, etc. Each block has some instructions and branching.

Looking at the code, the entry point is label 3, but it's not shown in the provided code. Hmm, maybe it's implicit. The first actual block is label 7, which has a phi node for %8, taking values from %3 and %12. So label 7 is a potential node.

Then there's label 12, which also has phi nodes for %13 and %14, and it loops back to itself. So label 12 is another node and it has a loop.

Let me outline the blocks:

1. The entry block, which I don't see here but might be implied. Let's call it label 3 as it's mentioned in the predecessors of block 7.

2. Block 7: It has a phi node for %8, which comes from %3 (entry) and %12. Then it computes %9, %10, and %11, and returns %11. So this is an exit block.

3. Block 12: It has phi nodes for %13 and %14, which come from themselves (loop) and the entry. Then it computes several things, including a loop increment, and branches back to 7 or itself based on some condition.

So the nodes are label 3, 7, and 12.

Now, the edges:

- From 3 to 7: Because in block 7, %8 comes from %3, which is the entry.

- From 12 to 7: Because in block 7, %8 can come from %12.

- From 12 to 12: Because block 12 has a loop that branches back to itself.

Wait, but looking at the code, the br instruction in block 12 goes to 7 or 12. So edges from 12 to 7 and 12 to 12.

So the CFG has three nodes: 3, 7, 12.

Edges:

3 -> 7

12 -> 7

12 -> 12 (loop)

That's the basic structure.

I should represent this in dot format. Each node will be a circle, with labels. Edges will show the flow.

So the dot code would have nodes for 3, 7, 12. Edges from 3 to 7, 12 to 7, and 12 to itself.

I think that's it. The user doesn't need the contents, just the structure. So the final dot file should reflect these nodes and edges.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their connections. The function has three main blocks: the entry block (label 3), block 7, and block 12. Block 12 loops back to itself, and both block 12 and the entry block connect to block 7.

Here is the CFG in dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=circle];
    "3" -> "7";
    "12" -> "7";
    "12" -> "12";
}
```

This graph shows the basic blocks as nodes and the control flow edges between them.
