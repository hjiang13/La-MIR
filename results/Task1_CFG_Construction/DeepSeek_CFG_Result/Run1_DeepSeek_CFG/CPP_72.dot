Alright, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code. Let me start by understanding the structure of the code. The function is `@_Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi`, which takes a vector and an integer. 

First, I'll identify the basic blocks by looking for labels. The labels I see are 2, 12, 14, 24, 28, 31. Wait, label 2 isn't present, so the function starts with label 2 implicitly. Then, the code jumps to label 12 or 28 based on the condition %11. 

From label 12, it calls a function and moves to label 14. Label 14 has a loop with phi nodes, indicating it's a loop header. The loop has a conditional branch to either label 24 or 31. Label 24 increments some variables and loops back to 14 or exits to 28. Label 28 checks another condition and branches to 31. Finally, label 31 returns the result.

I need to represent each label as a node and draw edges based on the branches. The loop is between 14 and 24, and there are conditional branches between other nodes. I'll make sure to connect each node correctly and denote the loop structure. The final graph should clearly show the flow of execution through these blocks.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code, we first identify the basic blocks by their labels. The IR code has several labeled basic blocks that represent different points in the program's execution flow. Each basic block is a node in the CFG, and the edges between these nodes represent the control flow between the blocks.

Here is the CFG in DOT file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    label2[label="2"];
    label12[label="12"];
    label14[label="14"];
    label24[label="24"];
    label28[label="28"];
    label31[label="31"];
    
    label2 -> label12;
    label2 -> label28;
    
    label12 -> label14;
    
    label14 -> label24;
    label14 -> label31;
    
    label24 -> label28;
    label24 -> label14;
    
    label28 -> label31;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each node in the graph represents a basic block in the IR code, labeled with the corresponding label number from the code.
2. **Edges**: The directed edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks.
   - The function starts at label 2.
   - From label 2, there is a conditional branch to either label 12 or label 28.
   - Label 12 calls a function and unconditionally branches to label 14.
   - Label 14 is a loop header with phi nodes, indicating the start of a loop. It branches back to label 24 or exits to label 31.
   - Label 24 updates some variables and branches back to label 14 or exits to label 28.
   - Label 28 checks a condition and branches to label 31.
   - Label 31 is the exit point of the function.

This graph captures the control flow of the function, showing the possible execution paths through the basic blocks.
