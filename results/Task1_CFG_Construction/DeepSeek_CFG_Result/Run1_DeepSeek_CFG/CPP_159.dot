Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand what the IR code represents. It looks like it's in LLVM IR format, which is a low-level, assembly-like code used by compilers. The function in question is `_Z3eatiii`, which seems to be a function that takes a vector and some integers as parameters.

My goal is to identify the basic blocks and their connections. A basic block is a sequence of instructions that starts with a label and ends just before another label or the end of the function. So, I'll go through the code and look for labels.

Looking at the code, I see labels like `8`, `15`, and `23`. Each of these is a basic block. The function starts at the top, which I'll consider as the entry block, maybe labeled as `4` since it's the first block before any labels.

Next, I'll follow the control flow. The function starts with an icmp instruction comparing `%3` and `%2`. The result of this comparison determines whether the control flow goes to block `8` or block `15`. So, the first basic block (let's say `4`) has two outgoing edges: one to `8` and another to `15`.

Then, I'll look at what each block does. Block `8` starts with `br i1 %5, label %8, label %15`, which I think is a conditional branch. So, after block `4`, depending on the condition, it goes to either `8` or `15`. Wait, that might mean that `4` is the entry, then it branches to `8` or `15`.

Wait, maybe I should number the basic blocks as they appear. Let me list the labels:

- The function starts with some setup, then label `4` is the first block after the setup.
- Then there's a branch to `8` or `15`.
- Block `8` does some operations and then branches to `23`.
- Block `15` does some other operations and also branches to `23`.
- Block `23` is where both `8` and `15` merge, so it's a merge point.

So, the basic blocks are:
1. Entry block (let's call it `entry` or maybe `4` as per the code)
2. Block `8`
3. Block `15`
4. Block `23`
5. The return block, which is the end of the function.

Wait, but the code doesn't have a label for the return; it just has `ret void` at the end of block `23`. So, the CFG will have edges from `entry` to `8` and `15`, from `8` to `23`, from `15` to `23`, and from `23` to `ret`.

I think I need to represent each block as a node and draw edges based on how control flows from one block to another. The entry block is where the function starts, and it branches based on the initial condition. Both branches eventually lead to block `23`, which then exits the function.

So, the nodes would be:
- entry
- 8
- 15
- 23
- ret

And the edges:
- entry -> 8 (on true condition)
- entry -> 15 (on false condition)
- 8 -> 23
- 15 -> 23
- 23 -> ret

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other blocks or edges. The code doesn't seem to have any loops, just a conditional split and then a merge. So, this should cover all the control flow paths.

I think that's the basic structure. Now, I'll represent this in a dot file as per the user's request, showing nodes and edges without detailing the block contents.

Here is the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code represented in dot format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    entry [label="entry"];
    block8 [label="8"];
    block15 [label="15"];
    block23 [label="23"];
    ret [label="ret"];
    
    entry -> block8 [label="true"];
    entry -> block15 [label="false"];
    block8 -> block23;
    block15 -> block23;
    block23 -> ret;
}
```

This CFG shows the basic blocks and their control flow connections, starting from the entry block, branching based on a condition to blocks 8 and 15, merging at block 23, and finally exiting to the return block.
