Okay, so I have to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. I'm pretty new to this, so I'll take it step by step. 

First, I need to understand what a CFG is. From what I know, a CFG is a graph representation of a program where each node represents a basic block of code, and edges represent the flow of control between these blocks. A basic block is a sequence of instructions that is executed sequentially without any branches or jumps.

Looking at the IR code provided, it's a function called @_Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE, which seems to be a C++ function that returns a vector. The code is in LLVM IR format, so I need to parse it and identify the basic blocks.

I'll start by identifying the labels in the code. Each label marks the beginning of a basic block. Let me go through the code and list all the labels I see:

- 2: This is the entry block.
- 12: This block starts with %13 = phi float* [ %77, %76 ], [ %10, %2 ]
- 22: Starts with %23 = icmp eq float* %17, %16
- 24: Starts with store float %20, float* %17, align 4
- 26: Starts with %27 = ptrtoint float* %16 to i64
- 32: Invoke void @_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc(...)
- 33: Unreachable
- 34: Starts with %35 = icmp eq i64 %29, 0
- 43: Starts with %44 = shl nuw nsw i64 %41, 2
- 46: Starts with %47 = bitcast i8* %45 to float*
- 49: Starts with %50 = phi float [ %48, %46 ], [ %20, %34 ]
- 54: Starts with %55 = bitcast float* %51 to i8*
- 57: Starts with %58 = getelementptr inbounds float, float* %52, i64 1
- 60: Starts with %61 = bitcast float* %15 to i8*
- 62: Starts with store float* %51, float** %7, align 8
- 66: Landing pad for exceptions
- 68: Another landing pad for exceptions
- 70: Starts with %71 = phi { i8*, i32 } [ %67, %66 ], [ %69, %68 ]
- 73: Starts with %74 = bitcast float* %15 to i8*
- 75: Resume from exception
- 76: Starts with %77 = phi float* [ %65, %62 ], [ %13, %24 ], [ %13, %12 ]
- 88: The exit block, ret void

Now, I'll note the transitions between these blocks by looking at the branch instructions. Each 'br' instruction will tell me the flow. Sometimes it's conditional, sometimes it's unconditional.

Starting from the entry block 2:
- Block 2 ends with br i1 %11, label %88, label %12. So, if condition %11 is true, it goes to 88 (exit), else to 12.

Block 12 ends with br i1 %21, label %22, label %76. So, if %21 is true, go to 22, else to 76.

Block 22 ends with br i1 %23, label %26, label %24. So, condition %23 true goes to 26, else to 24.

Block 24 ends with br label %76. So, it goes back to 76.

Block 26 has a few calculations and ends with br i1 %31, label %32, label %34. So, condition %31 true goes to 32, else to 34.

Block 32 is an invoke, which can throw an exception, leading to landing pad 66 or 68, which both go to 70.

Block 34 does some calculations and ends with br label %43. So, it goes to 43.

Block 43 ends with a call to @Znwm, which can throw, leading to landing pad 66, then to 70. On success, it goes to 46.

Block 46 ends with br label %49. So, to 49.

Block 49 has two possible sources and ends with br i1 %53, label %54, label %57. So, condition %53 true goes to 54, else to 57.

Block 54 ends with br label %57. So, to 57.

Block 57 ends with br i1 %59, label %62, label %60. So, condition %59 true goes to 62, else to 60.

Block 60 ends with br label %62. So, to 62.

Block 62 ends with br label %76. So, back to 76.

Block 66 and 68 both lead to 70.

Block 70 does some cleanup and resumes with br label %75, which I think leads back to 62 or 76? Wait, in the code, block 75 is a resume, which I think just continues execution after handling the exception, probably leading back to 76.

Block 76 ends with br i1 %87, label %12, label %88. So, condition %87 true loops back to 12, else exits to 88.

Putting all these together, I can draw the edges between the blocks. Each block will be a node, and the 'br' instructions determine the edges.

I also notice that some blocks are exception handling (like 66, 68, 70, 75) and some are function calls or invokes that can lead there.

So, the main flow is from 2 -> 12 -> 22 -> 24 -> 76, and 2 -> 12 -> 22 -> 26 -> 32 (which is an error) or 34 -> 43 -> 46 -> 49 -> 54 -> 57 -> 60 -> 62 -> 76, and then 76 loops back to 12 or exits to 88.

The exception handling blocks (66, 68, 70, 75) are connected from invokes that might throw, like 32 and 43.

I think that's the general structure. Now, I'll represent this in a .dot file, showing each node as a label and edges as directed connections.

Here is the control flow graph represented in .dot format, showing the basic blocks as nodes and their connections as edges:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled, color=lightblue];
    
    // Nodes
    start[label="2"];
    bb12[label="12"];
    bb22[label="22"];
    bb24[label="24"];
    bb26[label="26"];
    bb32[label="32"];
    bb34[label="34"];
    bb43[label="43"];
    bb46[label="46"];
    bb49[label="49"];
    bb54[label="54"];
    bb57[label="57"];
    bb60[label="60"];
    bb62[label="62"];
    bb66[label="66"];
    bb68[label="68"];
    bb70[label="70"];
    bb75[label="75"];
    bb76[label="76"];
    end[label="88"];
    
    // Edges
    start -> bb12[label="false"];
    start -> end[label="true"];
    
    bb12 -> bb22[label="true"];
    bb12 -> bb76[label="false"];
    
    bb22 -> bb26[label="true"];
    bb22 -> bb24[label="false"];
    
    bb24 -> bb76;
    
    bb26 -> bb32[label="true"];
    bb26 -> bb34[label="false"];
    
    bb32 -> bb66;
    bb66 -> bb70;
    
    bb34 -> bb43;
    bb43 -> bb46[label="normal"];
    bb43 -> bb66[label="exception"];
    
    bb46 -> bb49;
    
    bb49 -> bb54[label="true"];
    bb49 -> bb57[label="false"];
    
    bb54 -> bb57;
    
    bb57 -> bb62[label="true"];
    bb57 -> bb60[label="false"];
    
    bb60 -> bb62;
    
    bb62 -> bb76;
    
    bb68 -> bb70;
    
    bb70 -> bb75;
    
    bb75 -> bb62;
    
    bb76 -> bb12[label="true"];
    bb76 -> end[label="false"];
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between the basic blocks of the given IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and edges indicate possible control flow paths between them. The labels on the edges indicate the conditions under which control flows from one block to another.
