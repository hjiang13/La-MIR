Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user has provided some IR code and wants the control flow graph in dot format. I need to figure out how to extract the necessary information from the IR code and translate it into the correct graph structure.

First, I'll look at the IR code. It starts with a module declaration, some attributes, and then defines a function `_Z3addii`. The function is pretty simple: it takes two i32 parameters, adds them, and returns the result. From a control flow perspective, this function has only one basic block because there are no branches or loops.

So, the function has an entry point, which is the start of the function, and then it proceeds to the addition instruction, followed by the return instruction. Since there's only one path through the function, the control flow graph will have just one node representing the entire basic block.

I need to represent this in dot format. Each node in the graph is typically a basic block. Since there's only one block, the graph will have a single node. The edges would represent the flow between blocks, but since there's only one, there are no edges to draw.

I should make sure to name the node appropriately. In this case, it can be labeled as "Function Entry and Exit" to indicate that the entire function is encapsulated within this single block. The dot file should reflect this structure clearly without any unnecessary complexity.

I should also ensure that the dot syntax is correct, with proper use of node identifiers and labels. Since there are no other blocks, the graph is straightforward.

In summary, the IR code provided translates to a control flow graph with a single node and no edges. This accurately represents the linear execution flow of the function without any branching.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we need to analyze the structure of the program and identify the basic blocks and their connections. 

The IR code provided represents a single function `@_Z3addii` with no control flow statements (e.g., branches, loops, or switches). The function is straightforward: it takes two arguments, performs an addition, and returns the result. There is only one basic block in this function.

Here is the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    start [label="Function Entry and Exit"];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node**: 
   - There is only one node in this graph, representing the entire function body. This is because the function is simple and has no control flow changes.

2. **Edges**: 
   - There are no edges in this graph because there is only one basic block, and no control flow transitions occur within the function.

This CFG accurately represents the structure of the given IR code, where the function executes in a linear sequence without any branching or looping behavior.
