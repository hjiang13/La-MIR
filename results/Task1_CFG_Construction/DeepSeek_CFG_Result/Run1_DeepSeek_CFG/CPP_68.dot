Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that a CFG represents the flow of control in a program, where each node is a basic block, and edges represent possible control flow between these blocks. So, my goal is to identify all the basic blocks in the IR code and then determine how they connect.

Looking at the IR code, it's in LLVM format. I see that the function is named @_Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE, which I think is a C++ function. The code has several labels like %2, %20, %29, etc., which are the basic blocks.

I'll start by listing all the labels I can find. Each label marks the beginning of a basic block. So, I'll go through the code and note each label.

After identifying all the labels, I need to determine how each basic block ends. Typically, a basic block ends with a branch instruction, like 'br', which can be conditional or unconditional. The target of these branches will give me the edges between the nodes.

For example, the first basic block is %2. It ends with a 'br' instruction to either %98 or %20. So, there's an edge from %2 to %98 and another to %20.

I'll continue this process for each block. Some blocks have multiple predecessors, especially loops. For instance, block %20 seems to be part of a loop since it has a phi instruction, which indicates multiple incoming values from different paths.

I also notice that some blocks end with 'call' instructions, but those don't affect control flow beyond possibly exceptions, which are handled with landingpad blocks, like %82 in this case.

Once I've mapped out all the blocks and their connections, I'll represent them in a dot file format. Each node will be labeled with its block number, and edges will show the flow between them.

I have to be careful with loops and ensure that the back edges are correctly represented. For example, block %88 seems to loop back to %20 under certain conditions.

I might make a mistake in identifying all the labels or misconnecting the blocks, so I'll double-check each branch and ensure that all edges are correctly noted.

After constructing the graph, I'll make sure it's in the correct dot syntax, with nodes and edges properly defined, and then output it as the final answer.

To construct the control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code, we identify each basic block and the control flow between them. Here's the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    %2 [label="2"];
    %20 [label="20"];
    %29 [label="29"];
    %36 [label="36"];
    %39 [label="39"];
    %46 [label="46"];
    %48 [label="48"];
    %52 [label="52"];
    %54 [label="54"];
    %57 [label="57"];
    %59 [label="59"];
    %64 [label="64"];
    %65 [label="65"];
    %68 [label="68"];
    %72 [label="72"];
    %78 [label="78"];
    %82 [label="82"];
    %85 [label="85"];
    %87 [label="87"];
    %88 [label="88"];
    %98 [label="98"];

    %2 -> %98;
    %2 -> %20;
    %20 -> %29;
    %20 -> %88;
    %29 -> %36;
    %29 -> %39;
    %36 -> %39;
    %36 -> %88;
    %39 -> %46;
    %39 -> %57;
    %46 -> %48;
    %48 -> %52;
    %48 -> %54;
    %52 -> %54;
    %54 -> %78;
    %57 -> %65;
    %57 -> %59;
    %59 -> %64;
    %59 -> %78;
    %64 -> %78;
    %65 -> %68;
    %65 -> %72;
    %68 -> %72;
    %72 -> %78;
    %78 -> %88;
    %82 -> %85;
    %82 -> %87;
    %85 -> %87;
    %87 -> %83 [label="exception"];
    %88 -> %20;
    %88 -> %98;
    %98 -> %2 [label="exit"];
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between basic blocks, with each node representing a block and edges indicating possible control transitions.
