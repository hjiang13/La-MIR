Okay, I need to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The user provided the IR code and wants the CFG in dot file format, showing nodes and edges with just the titles of each basic block. 

First, I'll look at the IR code to identify the basic blocks. Each label in the code represents a basic block. So I'll go through the code and list all the labels. 

Looking at the code, the function is defined with label 0, but the first block after the function definition is label 1. Wait, no, the function starts with %2 = icmp, and then branches to labels %11 and %3. So the initial block doesn't have a label; maybe it's implicit. But in the code, the blocks are labeled as 3, 11, 14, 23. Let me check:

- The first block after the function starts is not labeled; it's the entry point. Then it branches to label 11 or 3.
- Label 3 is a block that starts with %4 = phi.
- Label 11 starts with %12 = phi.
- Label 14 starts with %15 = phi.
- Label 23 starts with %24 = phi.

So the basic blocks are labeled 3, 11, 14, 23, and the entry block, which I'll call "entry" for simplicity.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these blocks. Let's see where each block branches to.

1. The entry block (implicitly before label 3) has a branch to label 11 or 3 based on the condition %2.
2. Block 3 has a branch to 14 or 23 based on %10.
3. Block 11 returns, so it's an exit point with no outgoing edges except to itself if there's a loop, but looking at the code, block 11 only has a return statement, so it doesn't loop back.
4. Block 14 has a loop back to itself or goes to block 23 based on %22.
5. Block 23 branches back to block 3 or goes to block 11 based on %28.

Wait, looking again at block 23, the branch is to label %11 or %3. So from 23, it can go to 11 or 3.

Putting this together:

- Entry -> 11 (if %2 is true)
- Entry -> 3 (if %2 is false)
- 3 -> 14 (if %10 is true)
- 3 -> 23 (if %10 is false)
- 14 -> 14 (loop back if %22 is true)
- 14 -> 23 (if %22 is false)
- 23 -> 11 (if %28 is true)
- 23 -> 3 (if %28 is false)

Now, I need to represent this in dot language. Each node is a basic block, and edges show the control flow.

I'll create a graph with nodes for entry, 3, 11, 14, 23. Then, connect them according to the branches.

I should also note that the graph includes loops, such as 14 looping back to itself.

So, the final dot file will have these nodes and edges as per above.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we identify the basic blocks and their control flow edges. Here's the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box];

    entry;
    b3;
    b11;
    b14;
    b23;

    entry -> b11 [label = "true"];
    entry -> b3 [label = "false"];

    b3 -> b14 [label = "true"];
    b3 -> b23 [label = "false"];

    b14 -> b14 [label = "true", color="red"];
    b14 -> b23 [label = "false"];

    b23 -> b11 [label = "true"];
    b23 -> b3 [label = "false"];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with nodes for each basic block and edges showing the control flow directions. The edges are labeled with the conditions that lead to each branch.
