Alright, so I'm looking at this IR code, and I need to construct a control flow graph (CFG) from it. The user wants the output in dot file format, showing nodes and edges without listing the contents of each basic blockâ€”just their titles.

First, I'll start by identifying the basic blocks in the IR code. Basic blocks are sequences of instructions that are executed in order without any branches or labels that transfer control. Each label in the code marks the beginning of a new basic block.

Looking at the code, I see labels like 1, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, and 34. Each of these is a basic block. So, the nodes of my CFG will be these labels.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these nodes. Edges represent control flow, meaning where execution can jump from one block to another. For example, if there's a branch instruction that goes from block A to block B, there should be an edge from A to B.

Starting from the beginning, the function starts at label 1. From there, there's a branch to either label 12 or 32, depending on the result of the comparison. So, there's an edge from 1 to 12 and another from 1 to 32.

Then, in block 12, there's another branch based on a comparison. If the condition is true, it goes to label 18; otherwise, it goes to label 16. So, edges from 12 to 18 and 12 to 16.

Block 16 seems to have a single instruction and then branches to label 34. So, an edge from 16 to 34.

Block 18 has a phi node, which suggests it's a merge point for multiple incoming edges. There's a branch here based on another condition, leading to either block 32 or block 24. So, edges from 18 to 32 and 18 to 24.

Block 24 processes some data and then branches back to block 32. So, edge from 24 to 32.

Block 32 is a return point, so it ends there. It has incoming edges from multiple blocks (1, 18, 24), but no outgoing edges.

Block 34 has a loop structure. It processes some data and then loops back to itself or proceeds to block 18. So, edges from 34 to 34 (a loop) and from 34 to 18.

Putting it all together, I can draw the CFG with nodes labeled 1, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, and 34, and edges connecting them based on the control flow I identified.

I should make sure the dot file correctly represents these connections. Each node is a label, and each edge shows the possible flow between them. Since the user doesn't want the contents of each block, I'll focus solely on the labels and the edges.

I think that's all. Now, I'll format this into a dot file as per the user's request.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we first identify the basic blocks and then determine the control flow between them. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: Each label in the IR code represents the start of a basic block. The labels present are 1, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, and 34.

2. **Determine Control Flow**: 
   - Block 1 branches to either block 12 or 32.
   - Block 12 branches to either block 18 or 16.
   - Block 16 branches to block 34.
   - Block 18 branches to either block 32 or 24.
   - Block 24 branches back to block 32.
   - Block 34 loops back to itself and also branches to block 18.
   - Block 32 is the exit point with no outgoing edges.

Here is the CFG represented in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    "1" -> "12";
    "1" -> "32";

    "12" -> "18";
    "12" -> "16";

    "16" -> "34";

    "18" -> "32";
    "18" -> "24";

    "24" -> "32";

    "34" -> "34";
    "34" -> "18";

    "32" [shape=octagon];
}
```

This dot file illustrates the control flow between the basic blocks, with edges showing possible execution paths. Block 32 is represented as an octagon to signify it as the termination node.
