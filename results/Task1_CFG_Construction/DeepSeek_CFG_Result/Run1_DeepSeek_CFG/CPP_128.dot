Alright, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. The output should be a dot file with nodes and edges, showing the title of each basic block without listing their contents.

First, I'll parse the IR code to identify all the basic blocks. Each label in the code represents a basic block. Looking through the code, the labels are 1, 10, 15, 17, 44, 51, 61, 65.

Next, I'll determine the control flow between these blocks by examining the branching instructions. For example, the code starts at label 1, which branches to either label 65 or 10 based on the result of the comparison. Then, label 10 branches to 44 or 15, and so on.

I'll map out each possible path, noting which blocks lead to others. It's important to capture all possible edges, including loops. For instance, label 17 loops back to itself under certain conditions.

Once I have all the edges, I'll structure the dot file with nodes for each label and edges representing the control flow. Each node will be labeled with its corresponding block number.

Finally, I'll format the dot file correctly, ensuring that the graph is accurate and easy to follow.

To create the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code, we need to identify the basic blocks and their control flow edges. Here's the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1 [label="1"];
    10 [label="10"];
    15 [label="15"];
    17 [label="17"];
    44 [label="44"];
    51 [label="51"];
    61 [label="61"];
    65 [label="65"];

    1 -> 65 [label="cond"];
    1 -> 10 [label="cond"];

    10 -> 44 [label="cond"];
    10 -> 15 [label="cond"];

    15 -> 17 [label=""];
    
    17 -> 17 [label="loop"];
    17 -> 44 [label="cond"];

    44 -> 51 [label="cond"];
    44 -> 61 [label="cond"];

    51 -> 61 [label=""];

    61 -> 65 [label=""];

    65 -> 65 [label="ret"];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with basic blocks as nodes and control flow edges as directed edges. Each node is labeled with its corresponding basic block number, and edges represent the possible control flow paths between these blocks.
