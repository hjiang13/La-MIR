Okay, I need to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The IR code is in LLVM format, and the function is called triples_sum_to_zero. My task is to represent this CFG as a dot file, showing the nodes (basic blocks) and edges (control flow) without listing the content of each block, just their titles.

First, I'll identify all the basic blocks in the code. Looking at the code, each label followed by a colon indicates the start of a new basic block. So, I'll list all the labels: 1, 11, 13, 17, 25, 27, 32, 38, 40, 47.

Next, I need to determine the control flow between these blocks. I'll look at the 'br' instructions to see where each block branches to.

Starting with block 1, the initial block. It branches based on the result of %10. If true, it goes to block 47; if false, it goes to block 11.

Block 11 calls a function and then branches to block 17.

Block 13 has a few predecessors: 27, 25, and 17. It branches to either block 47 or back to block 17 based on %16.

Block 17 is a merge point with predecessors 11, 13. It has a phi node indicating it's a loop header. It computes some values and then branches based on %24 to either block 27 or stays in the loop at block 13.

Block 25 has a predecessor of 38. It increments a value and branches to block 27 or 13 based on %31.

Block 27 has predecessors 17 and 25. It computes some values and then branches to block 32 or back to 13 based on %31.

Block 32 processes some data and then branches to block 40.

Block 38 is a loop that has a predecessor of 40. It checks a condition and branches back to 40 or to block 25.

Block 40 has predecessors 32 and 38. It processes data and checks a condition to branch back to 38 or to block 47.

Block 47 is the exit block, returning the result.

Now, I'll map these connections:

1 -> 47 and 11
11 -> 17
17 -> 27 and 13
13 -> 47 and 17
25 -> 27 and 13
27 -> 32 and 13
32 -> 40
38 -> 40 and 25
40 -> 38 and 47

I need to represent this as a dot file, showing each node and the edges. Each node is labeled with its block number. Edges are directed arrows showing the control flow.

I should make sure that the graph is correctly structured, with all nodes and edges accounted for. I'll use standard dot syntax, starting with digraph, adding nodes, and then edges.

Here's the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"];
    11[label="11"];
    13[label="13"];
    17[label="17"];
    25[label="25"];
    27[label="27"];
    32[label="32"];
    38[label="38"];
    40[label="40"];
    47[label="47"];

    1 -> 47;
    1 -> 11;

    11 -> 17;

    17 -> 27;
    17 -> 13;

    13 -> 47;
    13 -> 17;

    25 -> 27;
    25 -> 13;

    27 -> 32;
    27 -> 13;

    32 -> 40;

    38 -> 40;
    38 -> 25;

    40 -> 38;
    40 -> 47;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph where each node is a basic block labeled with its number, and edges represent the control flow between blocks.
