Okay, I need to analyze the given IR code and create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. Let me start by understanding the structure of the IR code provided. 

The function is `_Z8is_primex(i64 %0)`, which takes an i64 argument and returns a boolean. The code has several labels: 1, 3, 5, 13, and 15. Each label represents a basic block.

Looking at the code, the first block is label 1, which is the entry point. It starts by comparing if %0 is less than 2 using `icmp slt`. Depending on this condition, it branches to either label 15 or label 3.

Next, label 3 is another basic block. Here, it checks if %0 is less than 4. If true, it branches to label 15; otherwise, it goes to label 5.

Label 5 is a loop. It has a PHI node that takes the value from %9 (from label 5) or 2 (from label 3). Then it calculates the remainder of %0 divided by %6 and checks if it's zero. It increments %6 by 1, squares it, and checks if it's greater than %0. Depending on these conditions, it either branches to label 13 or loops back to label 5.

Label 13 is another basic block. It XORs the result from the previous block and branches to label 15.

Finally, label 15 is where all paths converge. It uses a PHI node to determine the return value based on which block it came from and then returns the result.

Now, I'll map these blocks and their connections. Label 1 branches to 15 and 3. Label 3 branches to 15 and 5. Label 5 has a loop back to itself and a branch to 13. Label 13 branches to 15. Label 15 is the exit point.

I'll represent each label as a node in the DOT file. The edges will show the flow between these nodes based on the branches. I'll make sure to include all connections accurately.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    1 [label="1"];
    3 [label="3"];
    5 [label="5"];
    13 [label="13"];
    15 [label="15"];

    1 -> 15 [label="br"];
    1 -> 3 [label="br"];

    3 -> 15 [label="br"];
    3 -> 5 [label="br"];

    5 -> 5 [label="br", color="blue"];
    5 -> 13 [label="br"];

    13 -> 15 [label="br"];
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph with nodes labeled according to their basic blocks and edges showing the branching between them.
