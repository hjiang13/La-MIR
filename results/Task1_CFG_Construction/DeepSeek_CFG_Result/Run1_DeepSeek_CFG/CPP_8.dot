Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. 

First, I know that a CFG represents the flow of a program's execution, showing the different basic blocks and how they connect. Each basic block is a sequence of instructions that are executed in order without any branching. The edges between blocks represent control flow, like jumps or branches.

Looking at the IR code, I see that it's in LLVM format. The function is named @_Z11sum_productSt6vectorIiSaIiEE, which I think is a mangled name. I'll focus on the structure rather than the function name.

The code starts with some variable definitions and then the function. The function has several labels like 2, 11, 15, etc. Each label marks the beginning of a basic block.

I need to identify each basic block and see where they jump to. For example, the first block after the function starts is label 2. It has a few instructions and then a branch to either label 91 or 11 based on the condition %10. So, block 2 has two outgoing edges: one to 91 and another to 11.

Next, block 11 starts. It computes some values and then branches to either 87 or 15. So, block 11 has edges to 87 and 15.

Block 15 does some calculations and then branches to 55 or continues to 22. Wait, no, looking again, block 15 has a branch to 55 if %21 is true, otherwise it goes to 22. So, block 15 has edges to 55 and 22.

Block 22 seems a bit complex. It has a bunch of PHI nodes, which I think are used for handling variables that come from different paths. Then it loops back to 24 or continues. Wait, no, block 22 branches to 24 unconditionally. So, block 22 has an edge to 24.

Block 24 is a loop. It has PHI nodes for variables that are updated each iteration. At the end, it checks a condition and either loops back to 24 or exits to 55. So, block 24 has edges to itself (loop) and to 55.

Block 55 is after the loop. It does some more calculations and then branches to either 77 or 66 based on %65. So, block 55 has edges to 77 and 66.

Block 66 is another block that does some operations and then branches to 77. So, block 66 has an edge to 77.

Block 77 handles the results from 55 and 66. It computes some values and then checks a condition to branch to 91 or 87. So, block 77 has edges to 91 and 87.

Block 87 seems to handle some more computations and then branches to 105. So, block 87 has an edge to 105.

Block 105 is another loop. It computes some values, updates variables, and loops back or exits to 91. So, block 105 has edges to itself and to 91.

Block 91 is the exit block. It does some memory operations and returns. So, it's the end point.

I need to make sure I've covered all the blocks and their connections. Let me list them out:

- Block 2 branches to 91 and 11
- Block 11 branches to 87 and 15
- Block 15 branches to 55 and 22
- Block 22 branches to 24
- Block 24 branches back to itself and to 55
- Block 55 branches to 77 and 66
- Block 66 branches to 77
- Block 77 branches to 91 and 87
- Block 87 branches to 105
- Block 105 branches back to itself and to 91
- Block 91 is the exit

Now, I'll represent this in a dot file. Each node is a basic block, and edges show the control flow. I'll make sure to include all the blocks and their connections accurately.

Here is the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    2 [label="2"];
    11 [label="11"];
    15 [label="15"];
    22 [label="22"];
    24 [label="24"];
    55 [label="55"];
    66 [label="66"];
    77 [label="77"];
    87 [label="87"];
    91 [label="91"];
    105 [label="105"];

    2 -> 91;
    2 -> 11;

    11 -> 87;
    11 -> 15;

    15 -> 55;
    15 -> 22;

    22 -> 24;

    24 -> 24;
    24 -> 55;

    55 -> 77;
    55 -> 66;

    66 -> 77;

    77 -> 91;
    77 -> 87;

    87 -> 105;

    105 -> 105;
    105 -> 91;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph where each node is a basic block labeled with its corresponding number, and edges represent the control flow between these blocks. You can visualize this graph using tools like Graphviz.
