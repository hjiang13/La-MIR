Okay, so the user provided a piece of IR code and asked for the control flow graph in dot format. They mentioned that they don't need the content of each basic block, just the titles of the nodes. 

First, I need to parse the IR code to identify the basic blocks. Each label in the code represents a basic block. I'll go through the code and list all the labels I see. 

Starting from the top, the function is defined, and then I see labels like 1, 10, 17, 20, etc. Each of these is a basic block. I'll note down each one as I come across them.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these blocks. The 'br' instructions show where each block branches to. For example, after block 1, there's a branch to either 74 or 10. So, block 1 has edges to 74 and 10.

I'll go through each block and see where they branch. Block 10 branches to 70 or 17. Block 17 goes to 20. Block 20 is a loop, so it branches back to itself or goes to 66. 

Continuing this process, I'll map out all the edges. Blocks 66 and 70 have their own branches, and block 76 is another loop that branches back to itself or to 74.

Once I have all the blocks and their connections, I can structure the dot file. Each node will be represented as a block with its label, and edges will show the flow between them.

I also notice some loops and conditional branches, so I'll make sure to represent those accurately in the graph. The final graph should clearly show the control flow, making it easy to understand the program's structure.

Finally, I'll present the dot code, ensuring it's correctly formatted so that the user can visualize it if they choose to render it.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    1[label="1"]
    10[label="10"]
    17[label="17"]
    20[label="20"]
    66[label="66"]
    70[label="70"]
    74[label="74"]
    76[label="76"]

    1 -> 74
    1 -> 10

    10 -> 70
    10 -> 17

    17 -> 20

    20 -> 20
    20 -> 66

    66 -> 74
    66 -> 70

    70 -> 76

    76 -> 74
    76 -> 76
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with nodes as basic blocks and edges as control flow between blocks. You can visualize this graph using any dot viewer or tool like Graphviz.
