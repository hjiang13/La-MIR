Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The user provided an LLVM IR code snippet, and they want the output in a DOT file format, showing nodes and edges without the content of each basic block, just the titles.

First, I should recall what a control flow graph is. It's a graphical representation of the flow of control through a program, where each node represents a basic block (a sequence of instructions without any branching), and edges represent possible control flow between these blocks.

Looking at the IR code, I see several labels like 3, 10, 12, 18, 28, 30. Each of these is a basic block in the function. The task is to connect these blocks based on the branching instructions.

I'll start by identifying each basic block. The labels are 3, 10, 12, 18, 28, 30. So, these will be my nodes in the graph.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these nodes. To do this, I'll look at the branching instructions in each block.

Starting from the beginning of the function:

- The function starts at the first basic block, which isn't labeled but let's call it 1. It has a branch to either 28 or 3 based on the condition %2.
- Block 3 branches to either 12 or 10 based on %9.
- Block 10 has a branch to 30.
- Block 12 has a phi node and branches to 28 or 18 based on %17.
- Block 18 is a loop with multiple phis and branches back to itself or to 28 based on %27.
- Block 30 is another loop with phis and branches back to itself or to 12 based on %60.
- Block 28 is the exit block, returning the result.

Now, connecting these:

1. The entry block (1) branches to 28 and 3.
2. Block 3 branches to 12 and 10.
3. Block 10 branches to 30.
4. Block 12 branches to 28 and 18.
5. Block 18 branches back to itself and to 28.
6. Block 30 branches back to itself and to 12.
7. Block 28 is the exit, so it doesn't branch anywhere else.

I need to represent this in DOT language. Each node will be a label, and edges will be directed from the source to the destination.

So, the nodes are 1, 3, 10, 12, 18, 28, 30.

Edges:

1 -> 28
1 -> 3
3 -> 12
3 -> 10
10 -> 30
12 -> 28
12 -> 18
18 -> 18 (loop)
18 -> 28
30 -> 30 (loop)
30 -> 12
28 -> (end)

Wait, in the actual code, block 30 loops back to itself and goes to 12. So, 30 has edges to itself and to 12.

Similarly, block 18 loops back to itself and goes to 28.

So, in the DOT file, each edge is represented as "A -> B".

Putting it all together, I can structure the DOT file with nodes and edges accordingly. Each node is a label, and edges are directed.

I should write it in a way that clearly shows the connections without any extra information. Just the nodes and edges.

So, the final DOT file will have each node and the edges between them as I've outlined.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format representing the IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    1 [label="1"];
    3 [label="3"];
    10 [label="10"];
    12 [label="12"];
    18 [label="18"];
    28 [label="28"];
    30 [label="30"];

    1 -> 28;
    1 -> 3;
    3 -> 12;
    3 -> 10;
    10 -> 30;
    12 -> 28;
    12 -> 18;
    18 -> 18;
    18 -> 28;
    30 -> 30;
    30 -> 12;
}
```

This graph shows the nodes (basic blocks) and the edges (control flow) between them based on the provided IR code. Each node represents a basic block labeled as per the code, and edges indicate possible control flow transitions.
