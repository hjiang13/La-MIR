Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to generate a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided IR code. The IR code is in LLVM format, and the function in question is `_Z9incr_listSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which seems to be a C++ function that modifies a vector of integers.

First, I need to understand the structure of the IR code. The function starts with some setup and then proceeds through multiple basic blocks. Each basic block is labeled with a number, like `2`, `11`, `15`, etc. My goal is to identify these blocks and the control flow between them.

Looking at the code, I can see that each block ends with a branch instruction, which directs the flow to another block. For example, the first block ends with `br i1 %10, label %69, label %11`, indicating that if the condition `%10` is true, it branches to block `69`, else to block `11`.

I'll start by listing all the blocks present in the function. From the code, the blocks are: `2`, `11`, `15`, `22`, `24`, `51`, `54`, `65`, `67`, `69`, `76`. Each of these blocks is a node in the CFG.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these nodes. Each branch instruction in a block points to another block, so I'll follow those to establish the connections.

- Block `2` branches to `69` or `11` based on `%10`.
- Block `11` branches to `67` or `15` based on `%14`.
- Block `15` branches to `51` or `22` based on `%21`.
- Block `22` starts a loop that continues to `24`, which loops back to itself or exits to `51` based on `%50`.
- Block `51` branches to `65` or `54` based on `%53`.
- Block `54` goes to `65`.
- Block `65` branches to `69` or `67` based on `%66`.
- Block `67` goes to `76`.
- Block `69` is an exit block, so it ends the function.
- Block `76` is a loop that continues to itself or exits to `69` based on `%82`.

I'll map these connections to form the edges in the DOT file. Each node will be represented as `block_<number>`, and edges will show the direction of control flow.

Finally, I'll structure this information into a DOT file, ensuring that each node is correctly connected based on the branch instructions. The result will be a visual representation of the control flow within the function.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    block_2 [label="2"];
    block_11 [label="11"];
    block_15 [label="15"];
    block_22 [label="22"];
    block_24 [label="24"];
    block_51 [label="51"];
    block_54 [label="54"];
    block_65 [label="65"];
    block_67 [label="67"];
    block_69 [label="69"];
    block_76 [label="76"];

    block_2 -> block_69;
    block_2 -> block_11;

    block_11 -> block_67;
    block_11 -> block_15;

    block_15 -> block_51;
    block_15 -> block_22;

    block_22 -> block_24;

    block_24 -> block_24;
    block_24 -> block_51;

    block_51 -> block_65;
    block_51 -> block_54;

    block_54 -> block_65;

    block_65 -> block_69;
    block_65 -> block_67;

    block_67 -> block_76;

    block_76 -> block_76;
    block_76 -> block_69;
}
```
