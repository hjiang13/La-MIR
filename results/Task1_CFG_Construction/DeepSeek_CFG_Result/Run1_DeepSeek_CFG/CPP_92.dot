Okay, I need to analyze this IR code and create a control flow graph. Let me start by understanding the structure of the given code. 

First, I see that the function is named @_Z7any_intfff, which probably stands for a function called 'any_int' with three float arguments. The function returns an i1, which is a boolean.

Looking at the code, it starts with some metadata and function attributes. The main function body begins after that. The code has several basic blocks, each identified by a label. 

The first part of the function calls llvm.round.f32 on each of the three float arguments (%0, %1, %2). After each round, it does an fcmp to check if the rounded value is unequal to the original. These comparisons set some flags.

Then there's a series of select instructions. The first select uses the result of the first comparison to choose between true and the second comparison's result. The second select does the same with the third comparison. Depending on whether any of these selects is true, the function branches to label %21 or %12.

If it branches to %12, there are more computations: adding pairs of the arguments and checking for equality. These results are combined with logical OR and another select. Then it branches back to %21.

Label %21 is where the function returns. It uses a phi instruction to merge the results from the two possible paths, either coming from the initial comparisons or the additional computations in %12.

So, the control flow has two main paths. The first is from the entry to the initial checks and then to %21. The second is from the initial checks to %12 and then back to %21.

I think the nodes in the CFG are the labels: entry (implicitly), %3 (which I assume is the start), %12, and %21. The edges are the possible jumps between them. From %3, it can go to %21 directly if the initial condition is met, or to %12 otherwise. From %12, it always goes back to %21.

I should represent this as a dot file, showing each node and the edges between them. I'll make sure to label each node clearly and show the conditional branches as edges.

To visualize the control flow graph (CFG) of the given IR code, we can represent it using a dot file. Below is the dot file that represents the CFG:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    start [label="Start (%3)"];
    block12 [label="Block 12"];
    block21 [label="Block 21"];

    start -> block21 [label="Condition from initial checks"];
    start -> block12 [label="Else"];
    block12 -> block21 [label="Unconditional"];
}
```

This dot file shows the control flow between the basic blocks in the IR code:
- The graph starts at the "Start" node (representing the beginning of the function).
- From the "Start" node, there are two possible paths:
  - One path leads directly to "Block 21" if the initial condition (any of the rounded values differing from the original) is true.
  - The other path leads to "Block 12" if the initial condition is false.
- "Block 12" contains additional computations and eventually leads back to "Block 21".
- "Block 21" is the merge point where the function returns the result.

You can visualize this graph using tools like Graphviz.
