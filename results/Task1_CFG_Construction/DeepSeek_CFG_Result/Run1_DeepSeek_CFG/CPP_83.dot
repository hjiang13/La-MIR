Okay, I need to create the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code. First, I'll identify all the basic blocks by their labels. Looking through the code, the labels are 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 18, 20, 28, 34, 42, 48, 51, 57.

Next, I'll determine the edges between these blocks. I'll go through each block and see where the branches (br) and jumps (like labels) go.

Starting with label 1: It's the entry point. It goes to label 3 because the first br instruction branches to %3.

Label 3: The br goes to label 57 if the condition is true, else to label 5. So, edges from 3 to 57 and 5.

Label 5: The br goes to 57 if the condition is true, else to 7. So, edges to 57 and 7.

Label 7: The br goes to 48 if true, else to 10. So, edges to 48 and 10.

Label 10: The br goes to 28 if true, else to 18. So, edges to 28 and 18.

Label 18: It goes to 20. So, edge from 18 to 20.

Label 20: It's a loop. The br at the end goes back to 20 if the condition is false. So, a self-loop on 20. Also, when the condition is true, it goes to 28. So, edge from 20 to 28.

Label 28: The br goes to 42 if the condition is false, else to 34. So, edges to 42 and 34.

Label 34: It's another loop. The br at the end goes back to 34 if the condition is false. So, a self-loop on 34. When true, it goes to 42. So, edge from 34 to 42.

Label 42: The br goes to 57 if true, else to 48. So, edges to 57 and 48.

Label 48: It goes to 51. So, edge from 48 to 51.

Label 51: It's a loop. The br at the end goes back to 51 if the condition is false. So, a self-loop on 51. When true, it goes to 57. So, edge from 51 to 57.

Label 57: It's the exit point, so no outgoing edges.

Now, I'll put all these edges into the dot file format, showing each node and its connections.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code, we'll represent each basic block as a node and each possible control flow transition as a directed edge between nodes. The nodes are labeled with their corresponding basic block numbers, and edges indicate the possible flow of control between blocks.

Here is the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled, color=lightblue];
    1[label="1"];
    3[label="3"];
    5[label="5"];
    7[label="7"];
    10[label="10"];
    18[label="18"];
    20[label="20"];
    28[label="28"];
    34[label="34"];
    42[label="42"];
    48[label="48"];
    51[label="51"];
    57[label="57"];

    1 -> 3;
    3 -> 57;
    3 -> 5;
    5 -> 57;
    5 -> 7;
    7 -> 48;
    7 -> 10;
    10 -> 28;
    10 -> 18;
    18 -> 20;
    20 -> 20;
    20 -> 28;
    28 -> 42;
    28 -> 34;
    34 -> 34;
    34 -> 42;
    42 -> 57;
    42 -> 48;
    48 -> 51;
    51 -> 51;
    51 -> 57;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph, where each node corresponds to a basic block, and edges represent the control flow between blocks. You can visualize this graph using tools like Graphviz.
