Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The IR code is in LLVM format, and it's for a function called `_Z6fibfibi`, which seems to be a Fibonacci function. My goal is to represent the CFG using a dot file, showing the nodes and edges without the detailed contents of each basic block.

First, I need to understand the structure of the IR code. The function starts with some allocations and initializations. Then there's a conditional branch based on whether the input is less than 3. If true, it goes to label 31, otherwise to label 8.

Looking at label 8, it increments the input, checks if it's equal to 4, and branches accordingly. If not, it goes into a loop starting at label 13. This loop seems to handle some calculations, possibly for even indices of the Fibonacci sequence.

There are a few more conditional checks and branches within the loop. For example, label 19 has a phi node, which suggests it's a merge point for different paths. There's a loop that continues until certain conditions are met, updating some variables each iteration.

The function exits through label 31, where it loads the result and returns it.

To create the CFG, I'll identify each label as a node. The edges will be determined by the branches between these labels. I'll map out each part of the code, noting where each branch leads. For loops, I'll ensure that the back edges are correctly represented.

I need to make sure all possible paths are included, even if some parts of the code are more complex, like the phi nodes and the nested loops. The final CFG should clearly show the flow from the start of the function to the exit, including all loops and conditionals.

After mapping out all the nodes and their connections, I'll translate this into a dot file format, representing each node as a label and each edge as a directed line. This will provide a clear visual representation of how the function executes.

To construct the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we identify each label as a node and draw edges based on the branches between these nodes. Below is the CFG represented in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    start -> 2;
    2 -> 31 [label="if %7"];
    2 -> 8 [label="else"];
    
    8 -> 31 [label="if %12"];
    8 -> 13 [label="else"];
    
    13 -> 19 [label="if %15"];
    13 -> 16 [label="else"];
    
    16 -> 35;
    
    19 -> 31 [label="if %24"];
    19 -> 25 [label="else"];
    
    25 -> 31;
    
    35 -> 19 [label="if %56"];
    35 -> 35 [label="else, loop"];
    
    31 -> exit;
    
    start[ label="start" ];
    2[ label="2" ];
    8[ label="8" ];
    13[ label="13" ];
    16[ label="16" ];
    19[ label="19" ];
    25[ label="25" ];
    31[ label="31" ];
    35[ label="35" ];
    exit[ label="exit" ];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with nodes corresponding to the labels in the IR code and directed edges representing the control flow between these nodes.
