Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code. The function in question is `_Z8sum_to_ni`, which calculates the sum of the first n integers. 

First, I'll look at the IR code step by step. The function starts by adding 1 to the input `%0`, resulting in `%2`. Then, it multiplies `%2` by `%0` to get `%3`. Next, it divides `%3` by 2, storing the result in `%4`, and finally returns `%4`.

Since the function is straightforward with no branches or loops, the CFG should be simple. There's only one basic block because all operations execute sequentially without any conditionals. 

I need to represent this in a DOT file. Each node in the DOT file corresponds to a basic block. Since there's only one block here, I'll name it something like `block1`. The edges between nodes represent control flow, but since there's only one block, there are no edges to draw.

So, the DOT file will have a single node with the label of the basic block. I'll make sure the syntax is correct, using `digraph` and `node` definitions. 

I should also check if the user wants any specific naming conventions or additional details, but since the instructions are clear, I'll stick to the basics. The final output should just display the single node without any edges, accurately representing the CFG.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) for the given IR code, we first identify the basic blocks and their connections. The provided IR code contains a single function `@_Z8sum_to_ni` with a sequence of operations that execute in a linear order. Here's how to construct the CFG:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**: A basic block is a sequence of instructions with no branches or labels. In this case, the entire function is a single basic block since there are no conditional branches or loops.

2. **Determine Control Flow**: Since there's only one basic block, there are no edges to draw in the CFG.

Here's the DOT representation of the CFG:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    block1 [label="Basic Block 1"];
}
```

This DOT file represents a control flow graph with a single node, indicating that the function executes in a straight line without any branching.
