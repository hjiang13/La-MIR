Alright, so I have this problem where I need to generate a control flow graph from the given IR code. The output should be in dot file format, showing nodes and edges without listing the content of each basic block. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what IR code is. It's Intermediate Representation, which is like a mid-level assembly code used by compilers. The code provided seems to be in LLVM IR, which I'm somewhat familiar with. It includes function definitions, data structures, and control flow instructions like branches and loops.

The task is to analyze this IR code and extract the control flow graph. Each node in the graph represents a basic block, which is a sequence of instructions without any control flow changes. The edges represent the flow between these blocks, like jumps or branches.

Looking at the IR code, the main function is `_Z25largest_smallest_integersSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`. I need to parse this function and identify all the basic blocks. Each label in the code (like `11`, `14`, `28`, etc.) represents a basic block. So, the first step is to list all these labels as nodes.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these nodes. This involves looking at the control flow instructions: where each block jumps to. For example, if there's a `br` instruction, it will direct the flow to another label. I'll need to map these jumps to create the edges in the graph.

I also notice some loops and conditional branches. For instance, after label `28`, there's a loop with `br i1 %51, label %14, label %28`. This means that depending on the condition, the flow can go back to `28` or proceed to `14`. I need to accurately represent these conditions in the graph.

Another thing to consider is the structure of the dot file. Each node will be represented with a unique identifier, and edges will show the direction of the flow. I'll need to make sure that the graph is correctly formatted so that it can be visualized without any issues.

I should also pay attention to the phi nodes, which are used for variable assignments that depend on the path taken to reach the block. These might indicate merges between different control flow paths, which is important for accurately representing the graph.

To summarize, my approach is:
1. Identify all the basic blocks (labels) in the IR code.
2. Determine the control flow between these blocks by examining branch instructions.
3. Construct the dot file with nodes and edges representing the control flow.
4. Ensure the dot file is correctly formatted for visualization.

I'll start by listing all the labels and then map the control flow based on the branch instructions. Once that's done, I'll structure it into the dot file format. Let's see how that goes.

Here's the control flow graph in dot file format, representing the nodes and edges based on the IR code:

```dot
digraph cfg {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, color=lightblue];
    
    2 [label="2"];
    11 [label="11"];
    14 [label="14"];
    28 [label="28"];
    35 [label="35"];
    40 [label="40"];
    42 [label="42"];
    47 [label="47"];
    
    2 -> 11 [label=""];
    2 -> 14 [label=""];
    11 -> 28 [label=""];
    14 -> 28 [label=""];
    28 -> 35 [label=""];
    28 -> 40 [label=""];
    35 -> 47 [label=""];
    40 -> 47 [label=""];
    40 -> 42 [label=""];
    42 -> 47 [label=""];
    47 -> 28 [label=""];
    47 -> 14 [label=""];
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between the basic blocks of the IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and edges indicate possible control flow transitions. The blocks are connected according to the branch instructions in the code.
