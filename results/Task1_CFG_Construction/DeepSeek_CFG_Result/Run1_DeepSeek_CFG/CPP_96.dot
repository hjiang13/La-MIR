Okay, I need to help the user by generating a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code. The user has given me a detailed IR code snippet and wants the output in dot file format, showing nodes and edges without the content of each basic block.

First, I'll start by identifying the basic blocks in the IR code. Each label in the code represents a basic block. I'll go through the code and list all the labels I find. The labels are numbers like 2, 7, 10, etc., up to 101.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these blocks. I'll look for branch instructions, like 'br', which indicate a transition from one block to another. For example, the first 'br' instruction branches to label 7 or 94 based on a condition. This means there's an edge from block 2 to 7 and another from 2 to 94.

I'll continue this process for each basic block, noting the destination labels for each 'br' instruction. Sometimes, blocks have multiple predecessors, especially loops. For instance, block 10 has incoming edges from block 7 and block 87 because of the phi nodes indicating loop iterations.

I also need to handle exceptions and landing pads, like the ones in blocks 83, 85, 95, 98, and 101. These are part of the exception handling mechanism and should be included in the CFG.

Once all edges are identified, I'll structure the dot file with nodes representing each basic block and edges showing the control flow. The nodes will be labeled with their respective block numbers, and edges will be drawn with arrows indicating the flow direction.

Finally, I'll present the dot code to the user, explaining that it represents the CFG with nodes as basic blocks and edges as control flow paths.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, label=""];

    2 [label="2"];
    7 [label="7"];
    10 [label="10"];
    21 [label="21"];
    25 [label="25"];
    27 [label="27"];
    29 [label="29"];
    33 [label="33"];
    38 [label="38"];
    40 [label="40"];
    42 [label="42"];
    54 [label="54"];
    57 [label="57"];
    59 [label="59"];
    61 [label="61"];
    63 [label="63"];
    65 [label="65"];
    73 [label="73"];
    77 [label="77"];
    79 [label="79"];
    87 [label="87"];
    94 [label="94"];
    95 [label="95"];
    98 [label="98"];
    101 [label="101"];

    2 -> 7;
    2 -> 94;
    7 -> 10;
    10 -> 21;
    10 -> 25;
    21 -> 42;
    21 -> 25;
    25 -> 27;
    25 -> 29;
    27 -> 87;
    29 -> 33;
    33 -> 38;
    33 -> 40;
    38 -> 40;
    40 -> 87;
    42 -> 54;
    42 -> 42;
    54 -> 57;
    54 -> 87;
    57 -> 59;
    57 -> 61;
    59 -> 87;
    61 -> 63;
    61 -> 65;
    63 -> 64;
    65 -> 73;
    73 -> 77;
    73 -> 79;
    77 -> 79;
    79 -> 87;
    87 -> 10;
    87 -> 94;
    94 -> 87;
    95 -> 98;
    95 -> 101;
    98 -> 101;
    101 -> 101;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph where:
- Each node represents a basic block in the IR code
- Each edge represents a control flow path between basic blocks
- The labels correspond to the basic block numbers in the IR code

You can visualize this graph using any dot viewer or tool like Graphviz.
