Alright, so the user has provided an IR code and wants me to generate a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. The output should only include the node titles without the contents of each basic block. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the given IR code. It's in LLVM IR, which I'm familiar with. The function is `_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, which seems to be checking if a string has correct bracketing, probably for parentheses.

Looking at the code, I see several labels: 1, 5, 8, 10, 23, and 25. These are the basic blocks. My task is to map the control flow between these blocks.

Starting from label 1, which is the entry point, it computes some values and then branches to either label 25 or 5 based on the comparison in %4. So, node 1 has edges to 25 and 5.

Next, label 5 is where the loop starts. It initializes some variables and then goes to label 10. So, node 5 points to 10.

Label 10 is a loop body. It has a phi node for %11 and %12, indicating the loop variables. After some computations, it checks condition %21 and branches back to 8 or to 25. Wait, no, looking again, it branches to 8 or 25. But wait, label 8 is actually the continuation after the loop body, so perhaps I need to correct that.

Wait, in the code, after label 10, it computes and then branches to 25 or back to 8. So node 10 has edges to 8 and 25.

Label 8 is the loop check. It compares %22 with %3 (probably the length) and branches to 23 if equal or back to 10. So node 8 has edges to 23 and 10.

Label 23 checks if %20 is zero and then branches to 25. So node 23 points to 25.

Label 25 is the exit point, returning the result. It has no outgoing edges.

Putting this all together, the CFG should show all these connections.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the branches. In label 10, after computing %21, it branches to 25 if true, else back to 8. So node 10 has edges to 25 and 8.

Label 8 then checks if %22 equals %3, branching to 23 if true, else back to 10. So node 8 connects to 23 and 10.

Label 23 then goes to 25. So the flow is from 23 to 25.

So the final CFG should have nodes 1, 5, 8, 10, 23, 25, with edges as follows:

1 -> 5
1 -> 25
5 -> 10
10 -> 8
10 -> 25
8 -> 23
8 -> 10
23 -> 25

I think that's accurate. Now, I'll represent this in DOT format as the user requested.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format, showing the nodes (basic blocks) and edges (control flow):

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    "1" [label="1"];
    "5" [label="5"];
    "8" [label="8"];
    "10" [label="10"];
    "23" [label="23"];
    "25" [label="25"];
    
    "1" -> "5";
    "1" -> "25";
    "5" -> "10";
    "10" -> "8";
    "10" -> "25";
    "8" -> "23";
    "8" -> "10";
    "23" -> "25";
}
```

This DOT file represents the control flow graph with nodes labeled by their basic block numbers and edges representing the control flow between them.
