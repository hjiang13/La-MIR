Okay, so I need to create a control flow graph for the given IR code. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that a control flow graph (CFG) represents the flow of a program's execution. Each node is a basic block, and edges represent possible control flows between these blocks. Basic blocks are sequences of instructions that are executed in order without any branches or jumps.

Looking at the IR code provided, I see that it's a function called @_Z21double_the_differenceSt6vectorIfSaIfEE. The function starts with some initial instructions and then has several labels: 10, 13, 15, 26, 30, 34, and some others like the return label.

I think each label in the IR corresponds to a basic block in the CFG. So, each label will be a node in the graph. Now, I need to figure out how these nodes connect to each other.

Starting from the beginning of the function, there's an initial block (let's call it %1) that leads to label 10. So, node 1 goes to node 10.

In label 10, after some calculations, it branches to label 15. So, node 10 has an edge to node 15.

Label 13 seems to be a return block. It has a phi instruction, which suggests it's a merge point, possibly from a loop. It returns a value, so it's an exit node.

Label 15 is a loop body. It does some computations and then checks a condition. Depending on that condition, it either goes to label 26 or label 34. So, node 15 has edges to nodes 26 and 34.

Label 26 checks if a number is odd or even. If it's odd, it goes to label 30; otherwise, it goes to label 34. So, node 26 connects to 30 and 34.

Label 30 does some calculations and then branches back to label 34. So, node 30 goes to node 34.

Label 34 seems to be the loop's end. It updates some variables and checks if it should loop again. If not, it goes back to label 15, creating a loop. If it's done, it goes to label 13. So, node 34 connects back to node 15 and also to node 13.

Putting this all together, the nodes are 1, 10, 13, 15, 26, 30, 34, and possibly others like 13 and 15 again. Wait, I think I need to represent each unique label as a node. Also, the initial block is node 1, and the return is node 13.

So the edges are:
1 -> 10
10 -> 15
15 -> 26, 34
26 -> 30, 34
30 -> 34
34 -> 15, 13

I might have missed some details, but I think this covers the main structure. I should represent each label as a node and draw the edges based on the branches and control flow.

To create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code, each label represents a basic block (node), and edges represent control flow between these blocks. Here's the structured CFG:

- **Nodes (Basic Blocks):** 1, 10, 13, 15, 26, 30, 34
- **Edges:**
  - 1 → 10
  - 10 → 15
  - 15 → 26, 34
  - 26 → 30, 34
  - 30 → 34
  - 34 → 15, 13

This graph visually represents the flow of execution through the function, showing how each basic block connects based on conditional branches and loops.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    1 [label="1"];
    10 [label="10"];
    13 [label="13"];
    15 [label="15"];
    26 [label="26"];
    30 [label="30"];
    34 [label="34"];

    1 -> 10;
    10 -> 15;
    15 -> 26;
    15 -> 34;
    26 -> 30;
    26 -> 34;
    30 -> 34;
    34 -> 15;
    34 -> 13;
}
```
