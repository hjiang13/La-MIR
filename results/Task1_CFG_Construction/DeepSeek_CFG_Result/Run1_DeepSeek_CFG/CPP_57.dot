Okay, I need to help the user by analyzing the provided IR code and generating a control flow graph in dot format. Let me start by understanding the task.

The user provided a chunk of IR code and wants me to extract the control flow graph. They specified that the output should be a dot file with nodes and edges, but without the content of each basic blockâ€”just the titles.

First, I'll look at the IR code to identify the basic blocks. Each label in the IR corresponds to a basic block. The labels are like 1, 11, 17, 19, 27, 42, 47. So, the nodes will be these labels.

Next, I need to determine the edges between these nodes. I'll look for branch instructions to see where each block jumps to. For example, the first block ends with a br instruction to labels 11 and 42. So, there's an edge from 1 to 11 and another to 42.

Continuing this process, block 11 has a br to 19 and 17. Block 17 branches to 47. Block 19 has a br to 42 and loops back to 27. Block 27 loops on itself and also goes to 42. Block 42 is the exit point. Block 47 loops back to itself and also goes to 19.

I'll map all these connections to form the edges in the graph. Then, I'll structure this into a dot file, making sure each node is represented and edges are correctly drawn.

I should also consider the user's requirement for simplicity, so I'll avoid adding unnecessary details and keep the dot file clean with just the necessary nodes and edges.

Finally, I'll present the dot file, explaining that it shows the control flow graph with nodes as basic blocks and edges as control flow paths.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code, we need to identify the basic blocks and their control flow paths. Each basic block is terminated by a branch instruction, and edges between blocks represent control flow.

Here is the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled, color=lightblue];
    
    label="1";
    label="11";
    label="17";
    label="19";
    label="27";
    label="42";
    label="47";
    
    "1" -> "11";
    "1" -> "42";
    
    "11" -> "19";
    "11" -> "17";
    
    "17" -> "47";
    
    "19" -> "42";
    "19" -> "27";
    
    "27" -> "42";
    "27" -> "27";  // Loop
    
    "42" -> "42";  // Exit
    
    "47" -> "19";
    "47" -> "47";  // Loop
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the code.
- **Edges**: Edges represent control flow between basic blocks.
- **Structure**: The graph starts at block `1` and ends at block `42`. There are loops in blocks `27` and `47`.

This CFG captures the control flow paths of the given IR code.
