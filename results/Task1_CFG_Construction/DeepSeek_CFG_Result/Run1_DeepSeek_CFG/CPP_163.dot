Alright, so I've got this IR code for a function called generate_integers, and I need to turn it into a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. The user wants just the nodes and edges, not the details inside each block. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the IR code. It's in LLVM IR, which I'm somewhat familiar with. The function starts with some variable initializations and then jumps into the first basic block, which is labeled as '12'. 

Looking through the code, I see several labels: 11, 12, 21, 23, 25, 31, 32, 33, 42, 45, 47, 51, 54, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 68, 70, and 71. Each of these labels represents a basic block in the function. 

I'll start by listing each label as a node. Then, I'll trace the control flow between these blocks. For example, the function starts at an implicit entry point, but in the given code, the first explicit block is 12. So, I'll draw an edge from the start to block 12.

From block 12, there's a conditional branch to either block 21 or block 71. So, I'll add edges from 12 to both 21 and 71.

Block 21 has two possible paths: one leading to block 25 and another to block 23. So, edges from 21 to 25 and 21 to 23.

Block 23 only goes to block 71, so an edge from 23 to 71.

Block 25 has a couple of conditions leading to blocks 31 and 33. So, edges from 25 to 31 and 25 to 33.

Block 31 calls a function and then goes to block 32, which is an unreachable instruction, so perhaps just an edge from 31 to 32, but since 32 is unreachable, it might not have an outgoing edge.

Block 33 has some computations and then leads to block 42 or 47. So, edges from 33 to 42 and 33 to 47.

Block 42 calls a memory allocation function (_Znwm) and then proceeds to block 45. So, edge from 42 to 45.

Block 45 then goes to block 47. So, edge from 45 to 47.

Block 47 has a condition leading to either block 51 or block 54. So, edges from 47 to 51 and 47 to 54.

Block 51 does a memmove and then goes to block 54. So, edge from 51 to 54.

Block 54 has a condition leading to block 59, but also has another path to block 57. So, edges from 54 to 57 and 54 to 59.

Block 57 calls a deallocation function and then goes to block 59. So, edge from 57 to 59.

Block 59 goes back to block 71. So, edge from 59 to 71.

Block 71 is a loop that can go back to itself or exit to block 11. So, edge from 71 to 11 and back to 71.

Additionally, there are exception handling blocks: 61, 63, 65, 68, 70. These are for handling memory allocation failures. So, from block 42, if an exception occurs, it goes to 61; from block 31, if an exception occurs, it goes to 63. Both 61 and 63 lead to 65, which then decides whether to go to 70 or handle it. Block 70 resumes the exception, and block 65 might go back to 70 or handle it.

I need to make sure all these edges are correctly represented in the DOT file. Each node is just the label, and edges show the flow between them. I'll structure it with the start node pointing to the entry block, and then all the subsequent blocks connected as per the control flow.

I think that covers all the blocks and their connections. Now, I'll translate this into the DOT format, making sure each node is present and edges are correctly drawn.

Here is the control flow graph in dot format for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    start -> 12;
    
    12 -> 21 [label="cond"];
    12 -> 71 [label="cond"];
    
    21 -> 25 [label="cond"];
    21 -> 23 [label="cond"];
    
    23 -> 71;
    
    25 -> 31 [label="cond"];
    25 -> 33 [label="cond"];
    
    31 -> 32;
    
    33 -> 42 [label="cond"];
    33 -> 47 [label="cond"];
    
    42 -> 45;
    
    45 -> 47;
    
    47 -> 51 [label="cond"];
    47 -> 54 [label="cond"];
    
    51 -> 54;
    
    54 -> 57 [label="cond"];
    54 -> 59 [label="cond"];
    
    57 -> 59;
    
    59 -> 71;
    
    71 -> 11 [label="cond"];
    71 -> 71 [label="loop"];
    
    61 -> 65;
    63 -> 65;
    
    65 -> 70 [label="cond"];
    65 -> 68 [label="cond"];
    
    68 -> 70;
    
    70 -> 70 [label="resume"];
}
```
