Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an IR code and wants a control flow graph (CFG) in dot file format, showing the nodes and edges without listing the content of each basic blockâ€”just their titles.

First, I need to understand what the IR code represents. It's written in LLVM Intermediate Representation, which is a mid-level, platform-agnostic assembly-like code used by the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Each basic block in the IR code is a sequence of instructions ending with a branch or return.

Looking at the provided IR code, it defines a function `@_Z20largest_prime_factori` which computes the largest prime factor of a given integer. The code has several labels: 1, 3, 10, 12, and 19. These labels represent the basic blocks in the function.

Next, I need to identify the control flow between these blocks. Control flow is determined by the branch instructions. Let's go through each label and see where they branch to.

1. The function starts at label 1, which isn't explicitly defined here, but the first block is label 3. It seems label 1 is the entry point, but in the code provided, label 3 is the first block after the initial check.
   
2. Label 2 is `br i1 %2, label %10, label %3`. So, if the condition is true, it goes to label 10; otherwise, it proceeds to label 3.

3. Label 3 has a phi instruction and ends with a branch to label 12 or 19 based on the condition %9.

4. Label 10 is a return block, returning %11.

5. Label 12 has another phi instruction and branches back to itself or to 19 based on %18.

6. Label 19 has a phi instruction and branches to 10 or back to 3 based on %23.

Now, I'll map out the edges based on these branches:

- From label 1 (implicit entry) to label 3.
- From label 3, there's a branch to label 12 if the condition is met, else to label 19.
- From label 12, it loops back to itself or goes to label 19.
- From label 19, it either goes to label 10 or back to label 3.
- Label 10 is the exit point, so it doesn't branch further.

Putting this together, the CFG nodes are the labels, and edges represent possible control flow paths. I'll represent this in dot language, which is a graph description language used by tools like Graphviz.

I need to ensure that each node is correctly connected based on the branches. Also, since label 10 is a return, it should be a terminal node without outgoing edges.

Finally, I'll structure the dot file with nodes for each label and edges showing the flow between them.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    
    label_1 [label="1"];
    label_3 [label="3"];
    label_10 [label="10"];
    label_12 [label="12"];
    label_19 [label="19"];
    
    label_1 -> label_3;
    label_3 -> label_10 [label="br condition false"];
    label_3 -> label_12 [label="br condition true"];
    label_10 -> label_19 [label="br condition false"];
    label_12 -> label_12 [label="br condition true, loop"];
    label_12 -> label_19 [label="br condition false"];
    label_19 -> label_10 [label="br condition true"];
    label_19 -> label_3 [label="br condition false"];
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph of the given IR code. Each node represents a basic block in the code, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks. The labels on the edges indicate the conditions under which control flows from one block to another.
