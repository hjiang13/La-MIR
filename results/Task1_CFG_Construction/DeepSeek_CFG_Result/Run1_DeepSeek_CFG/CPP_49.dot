Okay, so I need to figure out the control flow graph for this IR code. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the code is doing. It looks like a function called modp_ii that takes two integers and returns an integer. The function seems to compute some modulus operation, but it's not the standard modulus because it has some loops and condition checks.

First, I should identify all the basic blocks in the code. Each block starts with a label followed by a number. Looking through the code, the labels are 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 21, 23. Wait, label 2 is the entry point, right? Then, after the first icmp, it branches to 4 or 21. So label 4 is another block.

In label 4, there are some operations and then another branch to 10 or 8. So 8 is another block. Then, label 10 has a phi node, which suggests it's a merge point for values from different paths. From 10, it can go to 21 or loop back to 14. Wait, 14 is another block with its own phi nodes and loops.

Then there's label 21, which is the exit point where the function returns. Label 23 is another block that loops back to itself or goes to 10. So I think the blocks are 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 21, 23.

Now, I need to connect these blocks based on the branches. The entry block 2 branches to 4 or 21. Block 4 branches to 10 or 8. Block 8 goes to 23. Block 10 can go to 21 or 14. Block 14 loops back to itself and also goes to 21. Block 23 can loop back to itself or go to 10. Block 21 is the exit.

Wait, does block 10 have a branch to 14? Yes, because after the icmp in 10, if it's not equal, it goes to 14. And block 14 has a loop back to itself, so there's an edge from 14 to 14. Similarly, block 23 can loop back to itself.

I should make sure all the edges are correct. So the edges are:
- 2 → 4
- 2 → 21
- 4 → 10
- 4 → 8
- 8 → 23
- 10 → 21
- 10 → 14
- 14 → 21
- 14 → 14 (loop)
- 23 → 10
- 23 → 23 (loop)

I think that covers all the possible control flows. Now, I'll represent this in a dot file format, showing each node and its edges without the detailed content of each block.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format, showing the nodes and edges:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    start [label="2"];
    A [label="4"];
    B [label="8"];
    C [label="10"];
    D [label="14"];
    E [label="21"];
    F [label="23"];

    start -> A;
    start -> E;

    A -> C;
    A -> B;

    B -> F;

    C -> E;
    C -> D;

    D -> E;
    D -> D;

    F -> C;
    F -> F;
}
```

This graph represents the control flow of the given IR code, with nodes as basic blocks and directed edges showing the possible control flow paths. Each node is labeled with its corresponding block number.
