Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to generate a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided LLVM IR code. The user wants the output in a DOT file format, showing nodes and edges without the details of each basic blockâ€”just their titles.

First, I'll start by understanding the structure of the IR code. The function in question is `@_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi`, which seems to be a C++ function that adds elements to a vector. The code has several labels and branches, which correspond to the basic blocks in the CFG.

I'll go through the code step by step, identifying each label and the possible branches. Each label represents a node in the CFG, and the `br` instructions indicate edges between these nodes.

Starting from the entry point, the function begins at label `%2`. From there, it checks if `%1` is greater than 0 using `icmp sgt`. Depending on the result, it branches to either `%4` or `%86`. So, node 2 has edges to nodes 4 and 86.

Next, at label `%4`, there's another condition checking if `%1` is less than 8. This branches to either `%83` or `%9`. So, node 4 connects to nodes 83 and 9.

Label `%9` has a more complex condition involving bit manipulation and checks if `%11` equals 0, branching to `%55` or `%16`. Thus, node 9 connects to 55 and 16.

Label `%16` starts a loop. It has a `br` to `%18`, so node 16 points to node 18.

Label `%18` is a loop with multiple phis and loads, and it branches back to itself or to `%55` based on a loop condition. So, node 18 has edges to itself and node 55.

Label `%55` has a condition based on `%14` being zero, branching to `%77` or `%62`. Therefore, node 55 connects to 77 and 62.

Label `%62` is another loop similar to `%18` but seems to handle a different part of the vector processing. It branches to `%77` upon completion. So, node 62 points to 77.

Label `%77` has a condition checking if `%10` equals `%7`, branching to `%86` or `%83`. Thus, node 77 connects to 86 and 83.

Label `%83` is a loop that increments `%89` and continues until `%97` equals `%7`, branching back to itself or to `%86`. So, node 83 has edges to itself and node 86.

Label `%86` is the exit point where the function returns. It's connected from nodes 2, 77, and 88.

Putting all these connections together, I can map out each node and their respective edges. The DOT file will visualize these nodes and the flow between them, providing a clear picture of the function's control flow.

Here is the control flow graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    
    2[label="2"];
    4[label="4"];
    86[label="86"];
    9[label="9"];
    83[label="83"];
    55[label="55"];
    16[label="16"];
    18[label="18"];
    62[label="62"];
    77[label="77"];
    88[label="88"];
    
    2 -> 4;
    2 -> 86;
    
    4 -> 83;
    4 -> 9;
    
    9 -> 55;
    9 -> 16;
    
    16 -> 18;
    
    18 -> 18;
    18 -> 55;
    
    55 -> 77;
    55 -> 62;
    
    62 -> 77;
    
    77 -> 86;
    77 -> 83;
    
    83 -> 88;
    83 -> 83;
    
    88 -> 86;
    88 -> 88;
    
    86 -> 2;
}
```

This dot file represents the control flow graph with nodes as basic blocks and edges as control flow transitions. Each node is labeled with its block number, and edges represent possible control flow paths between blocks.
