Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code:
```
digraph {
  node[shape=record];
  "entry" -> "bb0";
  "bb0" -> "bb1";
  "bb1" -> "bb2";
  "bb2" -> "bb3";
  "bb3" -> "bb4";
  "bb4" -> "bb5";
  "bb5" -> "bb6";
  "bb6" -> "bb7";
  "bb7" -> "bb8";
  "bb8" -> "exit";
}
```
Note that this is a simplified control flow graph, and the actual graph may include more nodes and edges.
