Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code program:
```
digraph G {
  node [shape=box];
  0 [label="entry"];
  1 [label="bb1"];
  2 [label="bb2"];
  3 [label="bb3"];
  4 [label="bb4"];
  5 [label="bb5"];
  6 [label="bb6"];
  7 [label="bb7"];
  8 [label="bb8"];
  9 [label="bb9"];
  10 [label="bb10"];
  11 [label="bb11"];
  12 [label="bb12"];
  13 [label="bb13"];
  14 [label="bb14"];
  15 [label="bb15"];
  16 [label="bb16"];
  17 [label="bb17"];
  18 [label="bb18"];
  19 [label="bb19"];
  20 [label="bb20"];
  21 [label="bb21"];
  22 [label="bb22"];
  23 [label="bb23"];

  0 -> 1;
  1 -> 2;
  2 -> 3;
  3 -> 4;
  4 -> 5;
  5 -> 6;
  6 -> 7;
  7 -> 8;
  8 -> 9;
  9 -> 10;
  10 -> 11;
  11 -> 12;
  12 -> 13;
  13 -> 14;
  14 -> 15;
  15 -> 16;
  16 -> 17;
  17 -> 18;
  18 -> 19;
  19 -> 20;
  20 -> 21;
  21 -> 22;
  22 -> 23;
  23 -> 0;
}
```
This control flow graph shows the basic blocks in the program and the edges between them. Each basic block is represented by a node, and the edges represent the flow of control between the basic blocks. The entry point of the program is node 0, and the exit point is node 23. The program has a loop that repeats 10 times, and the loop is represented by the edges from node 10 to node 11 and from node 11 to node 10.
