Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code program:
```
digraph G {
    0 [label="entry"]
    1 [label="init"]
    2 [label="loop"]
    3 [label="sum_product"]
    4 [label="exit"]
    0 -> 1
    1 -> 2
    2 -> 3
    3 -> 4
}
```
Note that this is a simplified graph that only shows the basic structure of the control flow. The actual graph may contain more details and edges.
