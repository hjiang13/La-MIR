Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code program:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];
    0 [label="entry"];
    1 [label="_Z7iscuberi"];
    2 [label="llvm.abs.i32"];
    3 [label="loop"];
    4 [label="phi"];
    5 [label="mul"];
    6 [label="icmp ult"];
    7 [label="add nuw nsw"];
    8 [label="br i1"];
    9 [label="icmp ule"];
    10 [label="ret i1"];
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5;
    5 -> 6;
    6 -> 7;
    7 -> 8;
    8 -> 3;
    8 -> 9;
    9 -> 10;
}
```
Note that this is a simplified graph, and the actual graph may include additional nodes and edges depending on the specific implementation of the IR code.
