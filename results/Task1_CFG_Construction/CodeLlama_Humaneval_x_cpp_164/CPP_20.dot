The input IR code provided is a C++ function that implements a vector closest element search algorithm. Here is the control flow graph for the function:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box, style=rounded];

    "entry" -> "find_closest_elements" [label="Start"];

    "find_closest_elements" -> "find_closest_elements_impl" [label="Call"];
    "find_closest_elements_impl" -> "find_closest_elements_impl" [label="Recursive Call"];

    "find_closest_elements_impl" -> "find_closest_elements" [label="Return"];

    "find_closest_elements" -> "return" [label="Return"];
}
```
Note that this is a simplified control flow graph, and there are many other basic blocks and edges that are not included in this graph. The full control flow graph would be much more complex and difficult to read.
