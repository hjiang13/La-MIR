Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the control flow graph of the given IR code program:
```
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];
    0 [label="Start"];
    1 [label="Label"];
    2 [label="Argument"];
    3 [label="Operand"];
    4 [label="Instruction"];
    5 [label="End"];
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5;
}
```
Note that this is a simplified representation of the control flow graph, and it does not include the contents of each basic block. The labels for each node are just placeholders to help visualize the structure of the graph. In a real-world implementation, you would likely want to use more descriptive labels and include additional information such as the type of the instruction and the operands it operates on.
