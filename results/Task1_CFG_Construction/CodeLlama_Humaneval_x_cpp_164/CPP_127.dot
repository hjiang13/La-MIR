Sure, I can help you with that.

To create the control flow graph for the given IR code program, we can use the `llvm-cfv` command-line tool. Here's an example command that generates a CFG for the program in the input:
```bash
llvm-cfv -dot-cfg-only -o cfg.dot input.ll
```
This command tells `llvm-cfv` to only generate the CFG, in the DOT format, and to output it to a file called `cfg.dot`.

Here's an example of what the generated DOT file might look like:
```dot
digraph {
    node [shape=box style=filled color=lightgray];
    0 [label="entry"];
    1 [label="bb1"];
    2 [label="bb2"];
    3 [label="bb3"];
    4 [label="bb4"];
    5 [label="bb5"];
    6 [label="bb6"];
    7 [label="bb7"];
    8 [label="bb8"];
    9 [label="bb9"];
    10 [label="bb10"];
    11 [label="bb11"];
    12 [label="bb12"];

    edge [color=gray];
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5;
    5 -> 6;
    6 -> 7;
    7 -> 8;
    8 -> 9;
    9 -> 10;
    10 -> 11;
    11 -> 12;
    12 -> 0;
}
```
This DOT file defines a directed graph with 13 nodes (representing the basic blocks in the program) and 12 edges (representing the control flow between the basic blocks). The nodes are labeled with the corresponding basic block numbers, and the edges are labeled with the corresponding control flow instructions.

Note that the generated DOT file may be quite large and complex, depending on the size and complexity of the input program. It may be helpful to use a tool like `graphviz` to view and manipulate the graph.
