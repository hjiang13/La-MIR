Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code program:
```dot
digraph G {
    rankdir=TB;
    node[shape=box];

    b1[label="entry"]
    b2[label="strlen"]
    b3[label="exit"]

    b1 -> b2[label="call strlen"]
    b2 -> b3[label="return"]
}
```
Note that the above graph is a simplified representation of the control flow, and does not include the content of each basic block. The actual graph may be more complex and have additional edges and nodes.
