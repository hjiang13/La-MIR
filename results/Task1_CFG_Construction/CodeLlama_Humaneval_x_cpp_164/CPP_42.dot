Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code program:
```
digraph {
    node [shape=box];
    0 [label="Start"];
    1 [label="Allocate vector"];
    2 [label="Load vector"];
    3 [label="Increment vector"];
    4 [label="Store vector"];
    5 [label="Return"];
    6 [label="End"];
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5;
    5 -> 6;
}
```
Note that this is a simplified control flow graph, as it does not include all the details of the IR code, such as the specific instructions within each basic block.
