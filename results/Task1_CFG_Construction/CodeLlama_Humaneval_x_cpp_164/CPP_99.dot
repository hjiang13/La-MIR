Sure, here's the control flow graph for the given IR code program:

digraph G {
    node [shape=box];
    0 [label="entry"]
    1 [label="strtod"]
    2 [label="llvm.round.f64"]
    3 [label="fptosi"]
    4 [label="return"]
    0 -> 1 [label="strtod"]
    1 -> 2 [label="llvm.round.f64"]
    2 -> 3 [label="fptosi"]
    3 -> 4 [label="return"]
}

Note that this is a simplified graph, and the actual graph for a more complex program would be larger and more detailed.
