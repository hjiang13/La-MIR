Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code:
```
digraph {
    node [shape=record];
    0 [label="entry"];
    1 [label="loop"];
    2 [label="if"];
    3 [label="then"];
    4 [label="else"];
    5 [label="exit"];
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3 [label="true"];
    2 -> 4 [label="false"];
    3 -> 5;
    4 -> 5;
}
```
Note that this is a simplified representation of the control flow graph, and it does not include the content of each basic block. The full control flow graph would have more nodes and edges, representing the individual instructions within each basic block.
