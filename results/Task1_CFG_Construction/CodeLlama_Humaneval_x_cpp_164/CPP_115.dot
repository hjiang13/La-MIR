Sure, I can help you with that. The IR code you provided appears to be a C++ program that uses the `std::vector` class to create a vector of vectors. The `max_fill` function takes a vector of vectors as input and returns an integer.

To create a control flow graph for this function, we need to identify the basic blocks in the IR code. A basic block is a sequence of instructions that are executed without any branches or jumps.

After analyzing the IR code, I have identified the following basic blocks:

1. `entry`: The entry point of the function.
2. `prologue`: The prologue of the function, which sets up the stack frame and initializes the local variables.
3. `check_empty`: A block that checks if the input vector is empty. If it is, the function returns 0.
4. `loop_start`: The start of the loop that iterates over the elements of the input vector.
5. `loop_body`: The body of the loop, which computes the maximum value of the elements in the current subvector.
6. `loop_end`: The end of the loop, which updates the maximum value and goes back to the start of the loop if there are more elements to process.
7. `epilogue`: The epilogue of the function, which cleans up the stack frame and returns the maximum value.

Here is the control flow graph for the `max_fill` function:
```
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    prologue [label="prologue"];
    check_empty [label="check_empty"];
    loop_start [label="loop_start"];
    loop_body [label="loop_body"];
    loop_end [label="loop_end"];
    epilogue [label="epilogue"];

    entry -> prologue -> check_empty -> loop_start;
    loop_start -> loop_body;
    loop_body -> loop_end;
    loop_end -> epilogue;
}
```
Note that this is a simplified control flow graph that only shows the basic blocks and their relationships. It does not include the contents of each basic block or the specific instructions that are executed.
