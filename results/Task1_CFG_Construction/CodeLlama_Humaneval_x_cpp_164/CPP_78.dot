Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code program:
```dot
digraph {
    node[shape=box];

    "main" -> "hex_key";
    "hex_key" -> "llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8";
    "llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8" -> "llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64";
    "llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64" -> "llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8";
    "llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8" -> "ret";
}
```
Note that the nodes are represented by their function names, and the edges represent the control flow between the nodes. The `main` node is the entry point of the program, and the `ret` node is the exit point of the program. The `llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8` nodes are used to manage the lifetime of the `hex_key` variable.
