Sure, I can help you with that.

The control flow graph for the given IR code program is as follows:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];

    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block2;
    block2 -> block3;
    block3 -> block4;
    block4 -> block5;
    block5 -> block6;
    block6 -> exit;
}
```
Here's the dot file for the control flow graph:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];

    entry [label="entry"];
    block1 [label="block1"];
    block2 [label="block2"];
    block3 [label="block3"];
    block4 [label="block4"];
    block5 [label="block5"];
    block6 [label="block6"];
    exit [label="exit"];

    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block2;
    block2 -> block3;
    block3 -> block4;
    block4 -> block5;
    block5 -> block6;
    block6 -> exit;
}
```
Note that the nodes in the control flow graph are not labeled with the contents of each basic block, as you requested. Instead, each node is labeled with the title of the basic block (e.g., "entry", "block1", etc.).
