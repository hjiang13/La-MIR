Sure, here is the control flow graph for the given IR code program:
```
digraph G {
    node[shape=box];
    0[label="Start"];
    1[label="Function Attrs"];
    2[label="Define"];
    3[label="Attributes"];
    4[label="Module Attrs"];
    5[label="Module"];
    6[label="End"];
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5;
    5 -> 6;
    6 -> 0;
}
```
Note that this is a simplified version of the control flow graph, and it does not include all the details of the basic blocks. The nodes in the graph are labeled with the corresponding line numbers in the IR code program.
