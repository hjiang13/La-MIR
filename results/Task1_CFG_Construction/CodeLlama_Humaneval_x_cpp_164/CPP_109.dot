The given IR code is a program that implements a function to move a ball across a grid. The function takes a vector of integers as input, which represents the grid, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the ball was able to move successfully.

To analyze the control flow graph of this function, we can use the `llvm-dis` tool to disassemble the IR code and get a human-readable representation of the assembly code. We can then use a tool such as `objdump` to generate a control flow graph from the assembly code.

Here is an example of how to do this using the `llvm-dis` tool:
```
$ llvm-dis -o test.s test.ll
$ objdump -d test.s > test.dot
```
This will generate a file called `test.dot` that contains the control flow graph of the function in dot format. The graph will include nodes and edges that represent the basic blocks of the function and the control flow between them.

Here is an example of what the control flow graph might look like for the given function:
```
digraph G {
  node [shape=box];
  0 [label="Entry"];
  1 [label="Move ball"];
  2 [label="Check for collision"];
  3 [label="Update ball position"];
  4 [label="Check for goal"];
  5 [label="Exit"];
  0 -> 1;
  1 -> 2;
  2 -> 3;
  3 -> 4;
  4 -> 5;
}
```
This graph shows the basic blocks of the function and the control flow between them. The entry block is labeled "Entry" and is the first block to be executed. The "Move ball" block is labeled "1" and moves the ball across the grid. The "Check for collision" block is labeled "2" and checks for a collision with the wall or a goal. The "Update ball position" block is labeled "3" and updates the position of the ball. The "Check for goal" block is labeled "4" and checks if the ball has reached a goal. The "Exit" block is labeled "5" and is the last block to be executed.

Note that this is just one possible way to implement the control flow graph for this function, and the actual graph may depend on the specific implementation of the function.
