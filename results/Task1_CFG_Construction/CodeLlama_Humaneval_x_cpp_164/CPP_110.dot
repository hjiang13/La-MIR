This is an LLVM IR code for a C++ function named `_Z8exchangeB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`. The function takes three arguments: a string, two vectors, and a vector. The function is using the `umax` and `vector.reduce.add.v4i32` intrinsic functions.

Here is the control flow graph for the given code:
```dot
digraph {
    node [shape=record];
    "entry" [label="entry"];
    "exchange" [label="exchange"];
    "loop1" [label="loop1"];
    "loop2" [label="loop2"];
    "loop3" [label="loop3"];
    "loop4" [label="loop4"];
    "loop5" [label="loop5"];
    "exit" [label="exit"];
    "entry" -> "exchange";
    "exchange" -> "loop1";
    "loop1" -> "loop2";
    "loop2" -> "loop3";
    "loop3" -> "loop4";
    "loop4" -> "loop5";
    "loop5" -> "exit";
}
```
In this graph, each node represents a basic block in the function, and each edge represents a control flow transfer between basic blocks. The entry node is the first basic block in the function, and the exit node is the last basic block. The exchange node is the basic block where the function starts executing, and the loop1, loop2, loop3, loop4, and loop5 nodes are the basic blocks that form the loops in the function.
