This is a LLVM IR code, which can be compiled to assembly code and then assembled to machine code. To visualize the control flow graph, we can use the `llvm-dot` tool to generate a graphical representation of the control flow graph.

Here is an example of how to use the `llvm-dot` tool to generate a graphical representation of the control flow graph of the IR code:
```
$ llvm-dot -dot-cfg <input_file>
```
This will generate a file called `<input_file>.dot` which contains the graphical representation of the control flow graph.

To visualize the control flow graph, you can use a tool such as Graphviz to render the .dot file.
```
$ dot -Tpng <input_file>.dot > <output_file>.png
```
This will generate a PNG file called `<output_file>.png` which contains the visualization of the control flow graph.

Alternatively, you can use the `llvm-view-cfg` tool to visualize the control flow graph.
```
$ llvm-view-cfg <input_file>
```
This will open a window with an interactive visualization of the control flow graph.

It is important to note that the output of the `llvm-dot` tool is not a valid dot file, it is a dot file with an extra header that includes the name of the function and the module it belongs to. This is a common issue with the `llvm-dot` tool and it is not a problem with the generated graph.
