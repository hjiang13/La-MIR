Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code program:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];
    0 [label="entry"];
    1 [label="x_or_y"];
    2 [label="phi"];
    3 [label="icmp"];
    4 [label="zext"];
    5 [label="icmp"];
    6 [label="br"];
    7 [label="phi"];
    8 [label="and"];
    9 [label="icmp"];
    10 [label="select"];
    11 [label="ret"];
    12 [label="phi"];
    13 [label="srem"];
    14 [label="icmp"];
    15 [label="select"];
    16 [label="phi"];
    17 [label="add"];
    18 [label="mul"];
    19 [label="icmp"];
    20 [label="br"];
}
```
Note that each node in the graph is labeled with a number, which corresponds to the order in which the basic blocks appear in the original code. The edges between nodes represent the control flow between the basic blocks. For example, the edge from node 0 to node 1 represents the control flow from the entry basic block to the x_or_y basic block.
