Sure, I can help you with that!

To create the control flow graph, we need to identify the basic blocks in the program. A basic block is a sequence of instructions that always executes without branching. In this case, we can identify the following basic blocks:

1. `entry`: The entry point of the function, where the function arguments are initialized and the first instruction is executed.
2. `block1`: The first basic block, where the loop is initialized and the first iteration is executed.
3. `block2`: The second basic block, where the loop is tested and the next iteration is executed.
4. `block3`: The third basic block, where the loop is tested and the function returns.

With this information, we can create the control flow graph. Here's one possible representation:
```dot
digraph G {
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block2;
    block2 -> block3;
    block3 -> exit;
}
```
In this graph, `entry` represents the entry point of the function, `block1` represents the first basic block, `block2` represents the second basic block, and `block3` represents the third basic block. The `exit` node represents the exit point of the function.

Note that this is just one possible representation of the control flow graph. There may be other ways to represent the same graph, depending on the specific needs of the analysis.
