Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code:
```dot
digraph G {
  node [shape=record,style=filled];
  0 [label="Start"];
  1 [label="Allocate space for string"];
  2 [label="Create string"];
  3 [label="Get pointer to string"];
  4 [label="Get length of string"];
  5 [label="Check if string is palindrome"];
  6 [label="Return result"];
  7 [label="Free memory"];
  8 [label="End"];

  0 -> 1;
  1 -> 2;
  2 -> 3;
  3 -> 4;
  4 -> 5;
  5 -> 6;
  6 -> 7;
  7 -> 8;
}
```
Note that this is just a simple example, and the actual control flow graph for a more complex program would be much more complex.
