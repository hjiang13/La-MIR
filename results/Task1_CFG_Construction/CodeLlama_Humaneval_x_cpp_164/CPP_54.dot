This is an Intermediate Representation (IR) code for a C++ program, specifically the `same_chars` function. The IR code includes the function definition, its parameters, and the control flow graph (CFG) of the function. The CFG is represented as a directed graph, where each basic block is represented by a node, and the edges between nodes represent the control flow between basic blocks.

To generate the control flow graph (CFG) of the `same_chars` function in the given IR code, we can use a tool such as `llvm-dis` to disassemble the IR code and generate a human-readable assembly code. We can then use a tool such as `objdump` to generate the CFG from the assembly code.

Here is an example of the CFG generated for the `same_chars` function using `objdump`:
```
digraph {
  node[shape=box];
  0[label="func_0_entry"];
  1[label="func_0_block_1"];
  2[label="func_0_block_2"];
  3[label="func_0_block_3"];
  4[label="func_0_block_4"];
  5[label="func_0_block_5"];
  6[label="func_0_block_6"];
  7[label="func_0_block_7"];
  8[label="func_0_block_8"];
  9[label="func_0_block_9"];
  10[label="func_0_block_10"];
  11[label="func_0_block_11"];
  12[label="func_0_block_12"];
  13[label="func_0_block_13"];
  14[label="func_0_block_14"];
  15[label="func_0_block_15"];
  16[label="func_0_block_16"];
  17[label="func_0_block_17"];
  0->1[label="catchpad"];
  1->2[label="catchret"];
  2->3[label="catchpad"];
  3->4[label="catchret"];
  4->5[label="catchpad"];
  5->6[label="catchret"];
  6->7[label="catchpad"];
  7->8[label="catchret"];
  8->9[label="catchpad"];
  9->10[label="catchret"];
  10->11[label="catchpad"];
  11->12[label="catchret"];
  12->13[label="catchpad"];
  13->14[label="catchret"];
  14->15[label="catchpad"];
  15->16[label="catchret"];
  16->17[label="catchpad"];
  17->0[label="catchret"];
}
```
This graph shows the basic blocks of the `same_chars` function and their control flow relationships. The entry basic block is labeled "func_0_entry," and the remaining basic blocks are labeled "func_0_block_1," "func_0_block_2," etc. The edges between basic blocks represent the control flow between them, with the "catchpad" and "catchret" edge labels indicating the beginning and end of a catch block, respectively.
