Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the control flow graph for the given IR code:
```dot
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];
    0 [label="start"];
    1 [label="loop"];
    2 [label="if"];
    3 [label="then"];
    4 [label="else"];
    5 [label="end"];
    6 [label="multiply"];
    7 [label="abs"];
    8 [label="urem"];
    9 [label="mul"];
    10 [label="ret"];

    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5;
    5 -> 6;
    6 -> 7;
    7 -> 8;
    8 -> 9;
    9 -> 10;
    10 -> 5;
}
```
Note that this is a simplified control flow graph that only includes the main control flow of the function. There may be additional control flow edges not shown here, such as edges for exception handling or other special cases.
