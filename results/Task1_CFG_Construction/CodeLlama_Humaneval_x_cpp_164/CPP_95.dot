Sure, I can help you with that!

To generate the control flow graph for the given IR code, we can use a tool such as `llvm-cfviz`. This tool takes the IR code as input and generates a control flow graph in the form of a dot file.

Here's an example of how to use `llvm-cfviz` to generate the control flow graph for the given IR code:
```
llvm-cfviz -dot < IR_code.ll > CFG.dot
```
This will generate a dot file called `CFG.dot` that contains the control flow graph for the given IR code. The dot file can be opened in a graph visualization tool such as Graphviz or Gephi to view the control flow graph.

Alternatively, you can also use the `-dot` option with `llvm-dis` to generate the control flow graph directly from the IR code without having to use `llvm-cfviz`. Here's an example of how to do this:
```
llvm-dis -dot < IR_code.ll > CFG.dot
```
This will generate a dot file called `CFG.dot` that contains the control flow graph for the given IR code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
