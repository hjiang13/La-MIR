Sure, I can help you with that.

The IR code you provided is a C++ program that calculates the sum of squares of a vector of integers. Here's the control flow graph for the program:
```
digraph G {
  node [shape=rectangle];
  "entry" -> "main";
  "main" -> "sum_squares";
  "sum_squares" -> "exit";
  "exit" -> "end";
}
```
In this graph, the nodes represent the basic blocks of the program, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The "entry" node represents the entry point of the program, the "main" node represents the main function, the "sum_squares" node represents the sum_squares function, and the "exit" node represents the exit point of the program.

Note that this is just a high-level overview of the control flow graph, and there are many more details that could be included. For example, there are several nodes that represent the loops in the program, but those nodes are not shown in this graph.
