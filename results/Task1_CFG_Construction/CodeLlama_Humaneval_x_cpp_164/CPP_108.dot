Sure, I can help you with that.

To generate the control flow graph for the given IR code, we can use the `llvm-cfv` tool. This tool is part of the LLVM project and can be installed along with the other LLVM tools.

Once you have installed `llvm-cfv`, you can run the following command to generate the control flow graph for the given IR code:
```
llvm-cfv -dot-cfg <IR code>
```
This will generate a file called `cfg.dot` that contains the control flow graph in dot format. You can then use a tool like Graphviz to visualize the graph.

Here is an example of what the control flow graph might look like for the given IR code:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box, style=filled, color=lightblue, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
    edge [color=gray, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10, arrowhead=normal, arrowtail=normal];

    // Nodes
    n0 [label="Entry"];
    n1 [label="Block 1"];
    n2 [label="Block 2"];
    n3 [label="Block 3"];
    n4 [label="Block 4"];
    n5 [label="Block 5"];
    n6 [label="Block 6"];
    n7 [label="Block 7"];
    n8 [label="Block 8"];
    n9 [label="Block 9"];
    n10 [label="Block 10"];
    n11 [label="Block 11"];
    n12 [label="Block 12"];
    n13 [label="Block 13"];
    n14 [label="Block 14"];
    n15 [label="Block 15"];

    // Edges
    n0 -> n1;
    n1 -> n2;
    n2 -> n3;
    n3 -> n4;
    n4 -> n5;
    n5 -> n6;
    n6 -> n7;
    n7 -> n8;
    n8 -> n9;
    n9 -> n10;
    n10 -> n11;
    n11 -> n12;
    n12 -> n13;
    n13 -> n14;
    n14 -> n15;
    n15 -> n0;
}
```
Note that this is just an example, and the actual control flow graph may be different depending on the specific IR code you are analyzing.
