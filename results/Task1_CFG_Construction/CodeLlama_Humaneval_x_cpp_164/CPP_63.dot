Here is the control flow graph for the input code:
```
digraph {
    node[shape=box];
    0[label="entry"];
    1[label="if (n <= 1)"];
    2[label="return 1"];
    3[label="else"];
    4[label="fib(n-1)"];
    5[label="fib(n-2)"];
    6[label="return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)"];
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    1 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    3 -> 5;
    4 -> 6;
    5 -> 6;
}
```
Note that this is a simplified representation of the control flow graph, and it does not include the contents of the basic blocks. The actual control flow graph would include the contents of the basic blocks, such as the instructions and the control flow statements.
