Sure, I can help you with that.

To generate the control flow graph for the given IR code, we can use a tool like `llvm-dot`. Here's an example of how to use it:
```bash
$ llvm-dot -dot-cfg -o cfg.dot input.ll
```
This will generate a file called `cfg.dot` that contains the control flow graph in the DOT format.

Alternatively, you can use the `llvm-dis` tool to generate an assembly file from the IR code, and then use a tool like `dot` to generate the control flow graph from the assembly file. Here's an example of how to do this:
```bash
$ llvm-dis input.ll -o input.s
$ dot -Tdot input.s -o cfg.dot
```
This will generate a file called `cfg.dot` that contains the control flow graph in the DOT format.

Note that the resulting control flow graph will include all the basic blocks in the function, as well as the edges between them. If you only want to include the nodes and edges that are relevant to the function, you can use the `-filter` option with `llvm-dot` to specify a filter that only includes the nodes and edges that you are interested in. For example:
```bash
$ llvm-dot -dot-cfg -filter 'is_happy' -o cfg.dot input.ll
```
This will generate a control flow graph that only includes the nodes and edges that are relevant to the `is_happy` function.
