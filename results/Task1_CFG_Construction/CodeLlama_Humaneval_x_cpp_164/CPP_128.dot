The given code is an intermediate representation (IR) of a C++ program, and it is not in a format that is easily readable by humans. To analyze the control flow graph of this program, we need to use a tool that can parse and analyze the IR code.

One such tool is the LLVM intermediate representation (IR) viewer, which can be found at <https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-ir.html>. This tool provides a graphical representation of the control flow graph of the program, including the basic blocks and the edges between them.

To use the LLVM IR viewer, we need to first convert the IR code into a format that is readable by the tool. This can be done using the `llvm-as` command, which is part of the LLVM toolchain. We can use the following command to convert the IR code to a format that is readable by the LLVM IR viewer:
```
$ llvm-as <IR_code.ll> -o <IR_code.bc>
```
This will create a file called `<IR_code.bc>` that contains the converted IR code. We can then use the LLVM IR viewer to view the control flow graph of the program:
```
$ llvm-ir <IR_code.bc>
```
This will open a graphical representation of the control flow graph of the program in a new window. We can use the mouse to navigate through the graph and see the basic blocks and the edges between them.

Alternatively, we can also use the `llvm-cfv` command to view the control flow graph of the program. This command provides a text-based representation of the control flow graph, which can be useful for debugging and analysis purposes.
```
$ llvm-cfv <IR_code.bc>
```
This will print the control flow graph of the program to the standard output, showing the basic blocks and the edges between them. We can use the `llvm-ir` command to convert the IR code to a format that is readable by the LLVM IR viewer, and then use the LLVM IR viewer to view the control flow graph in a graphical format.

In summary, to analyze the control flow graph of a program in LLVM IR, we need to use a tool that can parse and analyze the IR code, such as the LLVM IR viewer or the `llvm-cfv` command. These tools provide a graphical or text-based representation of the control flow graph, which can be useful for debugging and analysis purposes.
