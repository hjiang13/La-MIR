The provided IR code is for a C++ function named "string_xor" that takes three parameters. The function is defined in a module with the name "../../Human_xBenchmarks_164/CPP_11/CPP_11.cpp".

To create a control flow graph for this function, we need to identify the basic blocks in the code. A basic block is a sequence of instructions that are executed sequentially. In this case, we can identify the following basic blocks:

1. Block 1: This block contains the entry point of the function and initializes the first parameter to 0.
2. Block 2: This block contains the first loop of the function. It iterates over the characters in the second and third parameters and performs a bitwise XOR operation on each character.
3. Block 3: This block contains the second loop of the function. It iterates over the characters in the third parameter and performs a bitwise XOR operation on each character.
4. Block 4: This block contains the exit point of the function and returns the result of the bitwise XOR operation.

To create a control flow graph for this function, we need to represent the basic blocks as nodes in the graph. We can use the following node names:

* Block 1: "entry"
* Block 2: "loop1"
* Block 3: "loop2"
* Block 4: "exit"

The edges in the graph represent the control flow between the basic blocks. In this case, the control flow is as follows:

* "entry" -> "loop1"
* "loop1" -> "loop2"
* "loop2" -> "exit"

We can represent the control flow graph using the following dot file:
```dot
digraph CFG {
    entry [shape=box];
    loop1 [shape=box];
    loop2 [shape=box];
    exit [shape=box];
    entry -> loop1;
    loop1 -> loop2;
    loop2 -> exit;
}
```
This dot file defines a directed graph with four nodes (entry, loop1, loop2, and exit) and three edges between them. Each node is represented as a box and the edges are represented as arrows between the nodes.
