I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI, I cannot execute the code you provided as it is not a valid programming language. Additionally, the code you provided is not a complete program, it is a portion of a program.

However, I can try to help you with your question. The control flow graph is a graphical representation of the control flow of a program. It is used to visualize the flow of a program and to identify potential errors or inefficiencies in the program's control flow.

To create a control flow graph for a program, you can use a variety of tools and techniques. One common approach is to use a debugging tool to trace the execution of the program and to create a graph of the control flow based on the execution trace. Another approach is to use a static analysis tool to analyze the source code of the program and to create a control flow graph based on the syntax and structure of the code.

There are many tools and libraries available for creating control flow graphs, including Graphviz, DOT, and PyDot. These tools allow you to create graphs and to customize the appearance of the nodes and edges.

Here is an example of a control flow graph for a simple program:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
    C -> D;
    D -> A;
}
```
This graph has four nodes (A, B, C, and D) and three edges (A -> B, B -> C, and C -> D). The edges represent the control flow between the nodes, with the direction of the edge indicating the direction of the control flow.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
