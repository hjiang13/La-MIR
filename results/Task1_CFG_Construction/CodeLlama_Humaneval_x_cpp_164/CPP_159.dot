I have generated the control flow graph for the given IR code program. The graph is represented in the dot language, which can be used to visualize the control flow of the program.

Here is the dot file that represents the control flow graph:
```dot
digraph ControlFlowGraph {
    node [shape=box];
    node0 [label="Start"];
    node1 [label="Return"];
    node2 [label="Allocate Memory"];
    node3 [label="Set Memory"];
    node4 [label="Compare"];
    node5 [label="Branch"];
    node6 [label="Call Function"];
    node7 [label="Return From Function"];
    node8 [label="Free Memory"];
    node9 [label="End"];

    node0 -> node1 [label="Return"];
    node2 -> node3 [label="Allocate Memory"];
    node3 -> node4 [label="Set Memory"];
    node4 -> node5 [label="Compare"];
    node5 -> node6 [label="Branch"];
    node6 -> node7 [label="Call Function"];
    node7 -> node8 [label="Return From Function"];
    node8 -> node9 [label="Free Memory"];
}
```
This control flow graph shows the order of execution of the basic blocks in the program. The graph starts with the "Start" node, which represents the entry point of the program. From there, the control flow proceeds to the "Return" node, which represents the return statement at the end of the program.

The "Allocate Memory" node represents the memory allocation statement in the program, and the "Set Memory" node represents the statement that sets the value of the memory. The "Compare" node represents the comparison operation in the program, and the "Branch" node represents the branch statement that determines which basic block to execute next.

The "Call Function" node represents the call to the "llvm.memset.p0i8.i64" function, and the "Return From Function" node represents the return statement from the function. Finally, the "Free Memory" node represents the memory deallocation statement in the program, and the "End" node represents the exit point of the program.

The edges between the nodes in the graph represent the control flow between the basic blocks in the program. For example, the edge from the "Return" node to the "Allocate Memory" node represents the control flow from the return statement to the memory allocation statement. Similarly, the edge from the "Set Memory" node to the "Compare" node represents the control flow from the statement that sets the value of the memory to the comparison operation.

Overall, this control flow graph provides a visual representation of the control flow of the program, which can be useful for analyzing and understanding the program's behavior.
