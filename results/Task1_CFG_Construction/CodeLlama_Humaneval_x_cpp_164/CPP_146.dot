Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code:
```
digraph {
    node[shape=box];
    0[label="entry"];
    1[label="specialFilter"];
    2[label="main"];
    3[label="specialFilter(std::vector<int>)"];
    4[label="return 0"];
    5[label="main"];
    edge[arrowhead=none];
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5;
    5 -> 0;
}
```
Note that the control flow graph is a simplified representation of the program's control flow, and it does not include the contents of each basic block. The nodes in the graph are labeled with the names of the functions and the edges represent the control flow between them.
