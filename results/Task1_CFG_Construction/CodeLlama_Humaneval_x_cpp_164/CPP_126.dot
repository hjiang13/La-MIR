Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];
    0 [label="entry"];
    1 [label="loop"];
    2 [label="if"];
    3 [label="then"];
    4 [label="else"];
    5 [label="loop"];
    6 [label="if"];
    7 [label="then"];
    8 [label="else"];
    9 [label="exit"];
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    2 -> 4;
    3 -> 5;
    4 -> 6;
    6 -> 7;
    6 -> 8;
    7 -> 9;
    8 -> 9;
    9 -> 1;
}
```
In this control flow graph, each node represents a basic block in the IR code. The edges between the nodes represent the control flow between the basic blocks. The `entry` node represents the entry point of the function, and the `exit` node represents the exit point of the function. The `loop` nodes represent the loops in the code, and the `if` nodes represent the conditional statements. The `then` and `else` nodes represent the branches of the conditional statements.

Note that the control flow graph does not include the contents of each basic block. It only shows the structure of the control flow.
