This is an IR code program for a function that computes the sum of squares of a vector. The function takes a vector as input and returns the sum of the squares of its elements.

To generate the control flow graph for this function, we can use the `llvm-dot` tool, which is part of the LLVM suite of tools. This tool takes an LLVM IR file as input and generates a Graphviz dot file that represents the control flow graph of the function.

Here is an example of how to use `llvm-dot` to generate the control flow graph for the function in the IR code program:
```
$ llvm-dot IRcode.ll -o CFG.dot
```
This command takes the IR code program in `IRcode.ll` and generates a Graphviz dot file called `CFG.dot` that represents the control flow graph of the function.

The resulting dot file will include nodes and edges that represent the basic blocks and control flow edges of the function. The title of each node will be the name of the basic block, and the edges will be labeled with the type of control flow edge (e.g., "fall-through" or "branch").

For example, the dot file might look something like this:
```
digraph CFG {
    node[shape=record,fontname="Courier New",fontsize=12];
    edge[arrowhead=vee];
    
    node1[label="entry"];
    node2[label="block 1"];
    node3[label="block 2"];
    node4[label="block 3"];
    node5[label="block 4"];
    node6[label="exit"];
    
    node1 -> node2;
    node2 -> node3;
    node3 -> node4;
    node4 -> node5;
    node5 -> node6;
    
    node1:s -> node2:n;
    node2:s -> node3:n;
    node3:s -> node4:n;
    node4:s -> node5:n;
    node5:s -> node6:n;
}
```
This dot file defines a directed graph with six nodes (representing the basic blocks) and five edges (representing the control flow edges between the basic blocks). The nodes are labeled with the name of the basic block, and the edges are labeled with the type of control flow edge.

Note that this is just an example, and the actual dot file generated by `llvm-dot` will depend on the specific IR code program being analyzed.
