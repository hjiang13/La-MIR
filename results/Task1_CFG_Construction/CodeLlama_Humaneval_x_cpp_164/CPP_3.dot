Sure, I can help you with that. The input you provided is an LLVM IR code for a C++ program. To generate a control flow graph for this program, we can use the `llvm-extract` tool, which is part of the LLVM project.

Here's an example of how to use `llvm-extract` to generate a control flow graph for the input you provided:
```
$ llvm-extract -o /tmp/output.dot -S 1 -c /tmp/input.ll
```
This command tells `llvm-extract` to extract the control flow graph for the input file `/tmp/input.ll` and save it to the file `/tmp/output.dot`. The `-S 1` option tells `llvm-extract` to extract the control flow graph from the first function in the input file, and the `-c` option tells it to extract the graph in dot format.

Once you have the control flow graph in dot format, you can use a tool like Graphviz or Gephi to visualize it. Here's an example of what the control flow graph for the input you provided might look like:

Note that this graph is just an example and may not be the exact control flow graph for the input you provided. The specific nodes and edges in the graph will depend on the details of the input code.
