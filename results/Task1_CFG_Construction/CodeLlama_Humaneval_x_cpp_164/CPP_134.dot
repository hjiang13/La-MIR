Here is the control flow graph for the given IR code:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];
    0 [label="Start"];
    1 [label="Allocate memory for basic_string"];
    2 [label="Get the length of the string"];
    3 [label="Check if the length is 0"];
    4 [label="Allocate memory for the string"];
    5 [label="Get the pointer to the string data"];
    6 [label="Check if the pointer is NULL"];
    7 [label="Get the first character of the string"];
    8 [label="Check if the first character is a letter"];
    9 [label="Get the second character of the string"];
    10 [label="Check if the second character is a letter"];
    11 [label="Get the third character of the string"];
    12 [label="Check if the third character is a letter"];
    13 [label="Check if the string is a palindrome"];
    14 [label="Free the memory for the string"];
    15 [label="Return the result"];

    edge [dir=back];
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5;
    5 -> 6;
    6 -> 7;
    7 -> 8;
    8 -> 9;
    9 -> 10;
    10 -> 11;
    11 -> 12;
    12 -> 13;
    13 -> 14;
    14 -> 15;
}
```
Note that this is a simplified version of the control flow graph, and it does not include the content of each basic block. The actual graph would be much more complex, with many more nodes and edges.
