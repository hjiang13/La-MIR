Sure, I can help you with that! To create a control flow graph for the given IR code, we first need to identify the basic blocks in the code. A basic block is a sequence of instructions that always executes from start to end, without any jumps, branches, or returns in between.

In this case, the IR code has several basic blocks, including the entry block, the loop body, and the exit block. Here's a breakdown of the basic blocks in the code:

1. Entry block: This block starts at the beginning of the code and contains the first two instructions, which load the address of the vector and the value of the parameter `n`.
2. Loop body: This block starts at the `br i1 %11` instruction and contains the instructions that execute while the loop condition is true. The loop body includes the `br label %17` instruction, which jumps to the start of the loop body, and the `br label %36` instruction, which jumps to the exit block.
3. Exit block: This block starts at the `ret i1 %37` instruction and contains the instructions that execute after the loop exits.

Now that we've identified the basic blocks, we can create a control flow graph. A control flow graph is a graphical representation of the control flow of a program. It shows the relationships between the basic blocks and the edges between them.

Here's a control flow graph for the given IR code:
```dot
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];
    entry -> loop_body [label=""];
    loop_body -> exit [label=""];
    exit -> loop_body [label=""];
}
```
In this graph, the `entry` node represents the entry block, the `loop_body` node represents the loop body, and the `exit` node represents the exit block. The edges between the nodes represent the control flow between the basic blocks. For example, the edge from the `entry` node to the `loop_body` node represents the jump from the entry block to the loop body.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
