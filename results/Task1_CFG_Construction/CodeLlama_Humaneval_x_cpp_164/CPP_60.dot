Sure, I can help you with that!

First, let me explain a bit about the input IR code. It's a representation of a C++ function named `sum_to_ni` that takes an integer argument `n` and returns an integer value. The function computes the sum of the integers from 1 to `n`.

Now, let's move on to the task at hand. To generate a control flow graph for this function, we need to identify the basic blocks in the code and draw edges between them to represent the control flow.

Here's the control flow graph for the `sum_to_ni` function:
```dot
digraph G {
    node [shape=box, fillcolor=lightblue, style=filled];
    node0 [label="Start", shape=ellipse, fillcolor=lightblue, style=filled];
    node1 [label="Add 1 to n", shape=ellipse, fillcolor=lightblue, style=filled];
    node2 [label="Multiply n by (n+1)", shape=ellipse, fillcolor=lightblue, style=filled];
    node3 [label="Divide by 2", shape=ellipse, fillcolor=lightblue, style=filled];
    node4 [label="Return", shape=ellipse, fillcolor=lightblue, style=filled];

    node0 -> node1 [label="Entry"];
    node1 -> node2 [label="Add 1 to n"];
    node2 -> node3 [label="Multiply n by (n+1)"];
    node3 -> node4 [label="Divide by 2"];
    node4 -> node0 [label="Return"];
}
```
In this graph, each node represents a basic block in the code. The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. The `node0` and `node4` nodes are the entry and exit points of the function, respectively.

The `node1` and `node2` nodes are the basic blocks that perform the addition and multiplication operations, respectively. The `node3` node is the basic block that performs the division operation. Finally, the `node4` node is the basic block that returns the result of the function.

Note that this control flow graph does not show the contents of each basic block. If you need more details, you can use a tool such as `llvm-dis` to disassemble the IR code and generate a more detailed control flow graph.
