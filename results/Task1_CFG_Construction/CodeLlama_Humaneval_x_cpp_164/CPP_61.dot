Sure, here's the control flow graph for the given IR code program:
```
digraph G {
    node[shape=box];
    0[label="start"];
    1[label="if (condition) {}"];
    2[label="return false"];
    3[label="else {}"];
    4[label="return true"];
    5[label="endif"];
    0->1;
    1->2;
    1->3;
    3->4;
    4->5;
}
```
This graph represents the control flow of the program, where each node represents a basic block and each edge represents a control flow edge between two basic blocks. The `start` node is the entry point of the program, and the `endif` node is the exit point. The `if` and `else` nodes represent the two branches of the program, and the `return` nodes represent the two possible outcomes of the program.
