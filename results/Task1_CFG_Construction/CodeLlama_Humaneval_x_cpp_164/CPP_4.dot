I cannot directly access the IR code you provided. However, I can give you an example of how to generate a control flow graph (CFG) from an IR code using the `opt` tool.

First, you need to install the LLVM toolchain on your system. Once you have installed it, you can use the `opt` tool to generate the CFG.

Here's an example usage of the `opt` tool to generate the CFG:
```css
$ opt -dot-cfg -disable-output my_function.ll
```
This command will generate a `.dot` file called `my_function.dot` that contains the CFG of the function `my_function` in the `my_function.ll` file.

You can then use the `dot` tool to visualize the CFG:
```css
$ dot -Tpng my_function.dot -o my_function.png
```
This command will generate a `my_function.png` file that contains a visual representation of the CFG.

Note that the `opt` tool can also generate other types of graphs, such as a call graph, a control dependence graph, or a data dependence graph. You can use the `-dot-call-graph`, `-dot-control-dependence-graph`, or `-dot-data-dependence-graph` options to generate these types of graphs.
