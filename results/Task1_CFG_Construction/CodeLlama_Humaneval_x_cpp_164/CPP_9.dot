As an expert in high-performance computation, I can analyze the given IR code program and produce a control flow graph for it. Here is the control flow graph for the given program:
```
digraph ControlFlowGraph {
    rankdir = TB;
    node [shape = record, style = filled, fillcolor = white, fontname = "Helvetica"];
    edge [arrowhead = normal, arrowsize = 0.5];

    // nodes
    entry [label = "entry"];
    bb_0 [label = "bb_0\n{ $this = alloca ... }"];
    bb_1 [label = "bb_1\n{ ... }"];
    bb_2 [label = "bb_2\n{ ... }"];
    bb_3 [label = "bb_3\n{ ... }"];
    bb_4 [label = "bb_4\n{ ... }"];
    bb_5 [label = "bb_5\n{ ... }"];
    bb_6 [label = "bb_6\n{ ... }"];
    bb_7 [label = "bb_7\n{ ... }"];
    bb_8 [label = "bb_8\n{ ... }"];
    bb_9 [label = "bb_9\n{ ... }"];
    bb_10 [label = "bb_10\n{ ... }"];
    bb_11 [label = "bb_11\n{ ... }"];
    exit [label = "exit"];

    // edges
    entry -> bb_0;
    bb_0 -> bb_1;
    bb_1 -> bb_2;
    bb_2 -> bb_3;
    bb_3 -> bb_4;
    bb_4 -> bb_5;
    bb_5 -> bb_6;
    bb_6 -> bb_7;
    bb_7 -> bb_8;
    bb_8 -> bb_9;
    bb_9 -> bb_10;
    bb_10 -> bb_11;
    bb_11 -> exit;
}
```
Note that this is a simplified version of the control flow graph, and the actual graph may include more details such as phi nodes and edge labels.
