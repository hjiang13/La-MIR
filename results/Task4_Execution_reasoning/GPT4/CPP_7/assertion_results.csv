"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({}, ""john""),{}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion statement based on the provided llvm ir code, we need to understand what the function `filter_by_substring` does and how it interacts with the inputs provided in the assertion.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **understanding the function signature**:
   the function `filter_by_substring` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local void @_z19filter_by_substringst6vectorinst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeesais5_ees5_(%""class.std::vector""* noalias sret(%""class.std::vector"") align 8 %0, %""class.std::vector""* nocapture readonly %1, %""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* nocapture readonly %2)
   ```
   this indicates that it takes three parameters:
   - a vector (likely of strings).
   - a second vector (also likely of strings).
   - a string (the substring to filter by).

2. **analyzing the assertion**:
   the assertion states:
   ```cpp
   assert (issame(filter_by_substring({}, ""john""), {}));
   ```
   this means we are calling `filter_by_substring` with an empty vector and the string ""john"", and we expect the result to also be an empty vector.

3. **behavior of `filter_by_substring`**:
   - the function seems to iterate over the elements of the second vector (which is empty in this case).
   - since the second vector is empty, there will be no elements to check against the substring ""john"".
   - the function should not add any elements to the first vector (which is also empty) since there are no elements to filter.

4. **expected output**:
   given that both the input vector and the second vector are empty, the function should return an empty vector as well. thus, the assertion checks if the result of `filter_by_substring({}, ""john"")` is equal to `{}` (an empty vector).

5. **conclusion**:
   since the function does not modify the first vector and there are no elements in the second vector to filter, the output will indeed be an empty vector.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({""xxx"", ""asd"", ""xxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}, ""xxx""), {""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion statement based on the provided llvm ir code, we need to understand the functionality of the `filter_by_substring` function and how it processes the input vector of strings.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **understanding the function signature**:
   the function `filter_by_substring` takes three parameters:
   - a reference to a vector of strings (the output vector).
   - a constant reference to a vector of strings (the input vector).
   - a constant reference to a string (the substring to filter by).

2. **input vector**:
   the input vector provided in the assertion is `{""xxx"", ""asd"", ""xxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxaaa"", ""xxx""}`. this vector contains six strings.

3. **substring to filter**:
   the substring we are filtering by is `""xxx""`.

4. **expected output**:
   the expected output vector is `{""xxx"", ""xxxaaa"", ""xxx""}`. this means we are looking for strings that contain the substring `""xxx""`.

5. **analyzing the llvm ir code**:
   - the function appears to iterate over the input vector and checks each string to see if it contains the substring `""xxx""`.
   - the relevant part of the code that performs the substring search is the call to `find` on the `basic_string` class, which checks if the substring exists within each string.
   - the function uses a loop to go through each string in the input vector and checks if it matches the criteria (contains the substring).

6. **filtering logic**:
   - the filtering logic seems to be implemented correctly, as it checks each string and adds it to the output vector if it contains the substring `""xxx""`.
   - the strings `""xxx""` and `""xxxaaa""` both contain the substring `""xxx""`, while the others do not.

7. **final evaluation**:
   - the assertion checks whether the output of `filter_by_substring` matches the expected output.
   - given the filtering logic and the input provided, the function should correctly return the strings that contain the substring `""xxx""`.

### conclusion
based on the analysis, the assertion is expected to pass since the function correctly filters the input vector based on the substring.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({""xxx"", ""asd"", ""aaaxxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}, ""xx""),{""xxx"", ""aaaxxy"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion statement based on the provided llvm ir code, we need to understand the function `filter_by_substring` and how it processes the input data.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **understanding the function signature**:
   - the function `filter_by_substring` takes three parameters:
     - a reference to a vector of strings (the list of strings to filter).
     - a reference to a vector of strings (the substring to search for).
     - a reference to a string (the substring to match against).
   - the return type is `void`, which indicates that the function modifies the first parameter in place.

2. **analyzing the logic**:
   - the function appears to iterate over the vector of strings and checks if each string contains the specified substring.
   - the relevant part of the code is where it uses the `find` method of the `basic_string` class to check for the presence of the substring.
   - if the substring is found, the string is retained in the output vector; otherwise, it is removed.

3. **input and expected output**:
   - the input vector is `{""xxx"", ""asd"", ""aaaxxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxaaa"", ""xxx""}`.
   - the substring to filter by is `""xx""`.
   - the expected output after filtering is `{""xxx"", ""aaaxxy"", ""xxxaaa"", ""xxx""}`.

4. **evaluating the assertion**:
   - we need to check if the strings `""xxx""`, `""aaaxxy""`, and `""xxxaaa""` contain the substring `""xx""`:
     - `""xxx""` contains `""xx""` (keep).
     - `""asd""` does not contain `""xx""` (remove).
     - `""aaaxxy""` contains `""xx""` (keep).
     - `""john doe""` does not contain `""xx""` (remove).
     - `""xxxaaa""` contains `""xx""` (keep).
     - `""xxx""` contains `""xx""` (keep).
   - the filtered result should indeed be `{""xxx"", ""aaaxxy"", ""xxxaaa"", ""xxx""}`.

5. **final evaluation**:
   - the assertion checks if the output of `filter_by_substring` matches the expected output.
   - since the output matches the expected result, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({""grunt"", ""trumpet"", ""prune"", ""gruesome""}, ""run"") ,{""grunt"", ""prune""}));",fail,"to analyze the assertion statement based on the provided llvm ir code, we need to understand the function `filter_by_substring` and how it processes the input data.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**: the function `filter_by_substring` takes three parameters:
   - a reference to a vector of strings (the first parameter).
   - a reference to another vector of strings (the second parameter).
   - a string (the third parameter) that is used as a substring for filtering.

2. **input data**: the assertion tests the function with the following inputs:
   - the first vector: `{""grunt"", ""trumpet"", ""prune"", ""gruesome""}`
   - the substring: `""run""`
   - the expected output vector: `{""grunt"", ""prune""}`

3. **function logic**: 
   - the function iterates over the first vector and checks if each string contains the substring `""run""`.
   - it uses the `find` method of the `basic_string` class to determine if the substring exists within each string.
   - if the substring is not found (indicated by `find` returning `-1`), the string is not included in the output vector.

4. **expected behavior**:
   - for the string `""grunt""`: the substring `""run""` is not found, so it should not be included in the output.
   - for the string `""trumpet""`: the substring `""run""` is not found, so it should not be included in the output.
   - for the string `""prune""`: the substring `""run""` is found, so it should be included in the output.
   - for the string `""gruesome""`: the substring `""run""` is not found, so it should not be included in the output.

5. **output vector**: based on the analysis:
   - the output vector should only contain `""prune""` since it is the only string that contains the substring `""run""`.

6. **assertion evaluation**: the assertion checks if the result of the function call is equal to `{""grunt"", ""prune""}`. however, based on our analysis, the expected output should be `{""prune""}`.

### conclusion
the assertion fails because the expected output does not match the actual output of the function.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
