assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);` based on the provided llvm ir code for the function `sum_to_n`, we need to evaluate the function's behavior when called with the argument `1`.

### step-by-step analysis of the llvm ir code

1. **function definition**: the function `sum_to_n` is defined to take a single integer parameter `%0`.

2. **operation breakdown**:
   - the first operation is `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`, which computes `1 + 1` when `%0` is `1`. thus, `%2` becomes `2`.
   - the next operation is `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`, which computes `2 * 1`. therefore, `%3` becomes `2`.
   - the final operation is `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`, which computes `2 / 2`. hence, `%4` becomes `1`.

3. **return value**: the function returns `%4`, which we have calculated to be `1`.

### evaluation of the assertion
the assertion statement checks if the result of `sum_to_n(1)` is equal to `1`. based on our analysis:
- `sum_to_n(1)` returns `1`.
- the assertion checks if `1 == 1`, which is true.

### final result
since the assertion holds true based on the evaluation of the function, we conclude that the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,pass,"to analyze the assertion `assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);`, we need to understand what the function `sum_to_n` does based on the provided llvm ir code.

### step-by-step analysis of the llvm ir code

1. **function signature**:
   the function is defined as `i32 @_z8sum_to_ni(i32 %0)`, which indicates that it takes a single integer argument and returns an integer.

2. **input parameter**:
   the input parameter is `%0`, which represents the integer input to the function.

3. **operations**:
   the function performs the following operations:
   - `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`: this adds 1 to the input value `%0`. if `%0` is 6, then `%2` becomes `6 + 1 = 7`.
   - `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`: this multiplies the result from the previous step (`%2`) by the input value `%0`. so, `%3` becomes `7 * 6 = 42`.
   - `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`: this divides the result from the multiplication by 2. thus, `%4` becomes `42 / 2 = 21`.

4. **return value**:
   the function returns `%4`, which we calculated to be `21` when the input is `6`.

### assertion evaluation
now we evaluate the assertion:
- the assertion states that `sum_to_n(6)` should equal `21`.
- based on our analysis, `sum_to_n(6)` indeed returns `21`.

### final result
since the assertion holds true, we conclude that it passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,pass,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);`, we need to evaluate the function `sum_to_n` based on the provided llvm ir code.

### step-by-step analysis of the llvm ir code

1. **function definition**:
   the function is defined as `i32 @_z8sum_to_ni(i32 %0)`, which indicates that it takes a single integer argument and returns an integer.

2. **function logic**:
   let's break down the operations in the function:
   - `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`: this line adds 1 to the input parameter `%0`. if we substitute `%0` with `11`, we get:
     ```
     %2 = 11 + 1 = 12
     ```
   - `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`: this line multiplies the result from the previous step (`%2`) with the original input (`%0`):
     ```
     %3 = 12 * 11 = 132
     ```
   - `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`: this line divides the result from the multiplication by 2:
     ```
     %4 = 132 / 2 = 66
     ```
   - `ret i32 %4`: finally, the function returns the value of `%4`, which is `66`.

3. **evaluating the assertion**:
   the assertion checks if `sum_to_n(11)` equals `66`. based on our evaluation of the function:
   ```
   sum_to_n(11) = 66
   ```
   therefore, the assertion `assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);` holds true.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,pass,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);` based on the provided llvm ir code for the function `sum_to_n`, we need to understand what the function does.

### step-by-step analysis of the function

1. **function definition**: the function `sum_to_n` is defined as follows:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local i32 @_z8sum_to_ni(i32 %0) local_unnamed_addr #0 {
   ```

2. **input parameter**: the function takes a single integer parameter `%0`, which represents the value of `n`.

3. **operations**:
   - the first operation is:
     ```llvm
     %2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1
     ```
     this adds 1 to the input value `n`, so for `n = 30`, `%2` becomes `31`.

   - the second operation is:
     ```llvm
     %3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0
     ```
     this multiplies `%2` (which is `31`) by `%0` (which is `30`), resulting in `%3 = 31 * 30 = 930`.

   - the third operation is:
     ```llvm
     %4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2
     ```
     this divides `%3` (which is `930`) by `2`, resulting in `%4 = 930 / 2 = 465`.

4. **return value**: the function returns the value of `%4`, which is `465`.

### assertion evaluation
now we can evaluate the assertion:
```cpp
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);
```
- the function `sum_to_n(30)` computes to `465`, which matches the right-hand side of the assertion.

### conclusion
since the computed value from the function matches the expected value in the assertion, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"to analyze whether the assertion `assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);` passes or fails based on the provided llvm ir code for the function `sum_to_n`, we need to break down the function's logic and verify if it correctly computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

### breakdown of the llvm ir code

1. **function definition**:
   the function `sum_to_n` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local i32 @_z8sum_to_ni(i32 %0) local_unnamed_addr #0 {
   ```

2. **input parameter**:
   the input parameter `%0` represents the integer `n` for which we want to compute the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

3. **calculations**:
   - the first operation is:
     ```llvm
     %2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1
     ```
     this computes `n + 1`.
   - the second operation is:
     ```llvm
     %3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0
     ```
     this computes `(n + 1) * n`.
   - the third operation is:
     ```llvm
     %4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2
     ```
     this computes the integer division of the product by 2, which gives us the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
     \]

4. **return value**:
   the function returns the value of `%4`, which is the computed sum.

### evaluation of the assertion

now, we need to evaluate the assertion:
```c
assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);
```

1. **calculate `sum_to_n(100)`**:
   - substitute `n = 100` into the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum} = \frac{100(100 + 1)}{2} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
   \]

2. **comparison**:
   the computed value of `sum_to_n(100)` is `5050`, which matches the expected value in the assertion.

### conclusion

since the computed value from the function matches the expected value in the assertion, we conclude that the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
