assert (fib4(5) == 4);,fail,"to analyze the assertion `assert (fib4(5) == 4);` based on the provided llvm ir code for the function `fib4`, we need to understand how the fibonacci function is implemented in the llvm ir code.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `fib4` appears to compute the fibonacci sequence. the assertion checks if `fib4(5)` returns `4`.

2. **understanding fibonacci sequence**: the fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
   - `fib(0) = 0`
   - `fib(1) = 1`
   - `fib(2) = 1`
   - `fib(3) = 2`
   - `fib(4) = 3`
   - `fib(5) = 5`
   
   therefore, `fib(5)` should return `5`, not `4`.

3. **llvm ir code analysis**:
   - the function starts by checking if the input `n` (in this case, `5`) is less than `4`. if it is, it directly returns the corresponding fibonacci number for `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3`.
   - for `n = 4`, it returns `3`.
   - for `n = 5`, the function goes into a recursive calculation where it computes `fib(4)` and `fib(3)` and sums them up.
   - the recursive calls will eventually compute `fib(5)` as `fib(4) + fib(3)`, which equals `3 + 2 = 5`.

4. **conclusion**: since `fib4(5)` computes to `5`, the assertion `assert (fib4(5) == 4);` is incorrect.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
assert (fib4(8) == 28);,fail,"to analyze the assertion `assert (fib4(8) == 28);` based on the provided llvm ir code for the function `fib4`, we need to understand how the fibonacci-like function is implemented in the llvm ir code.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `fib4` appears to compute a value similar to the fibonacci sequence, but with a specific adjustment for the base cases and the way it combines results.

2. **base cases**: 
   - the function checks if the input `n` (in this case, `8`) is less than `4`. if `n < 4`, it returns predefined values:
     - `fib4(0) = 0`
     - `fib4(1) = 0`
     - `fib4(2) = 2`
     - `fib4(3) = 2`
   - for `n = 4`, the function does not explicitly return a value, but it is implied that it will compute further.

3. **recursive calculation**:
   - for `n >= 4`, the function uses a recursive approach to compute the value. the recursion is structured such that:
     - `fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)`
   - this means that to compute `fib4(8)`, we need to compute `fib4(7)`, `fib4(6)`, `fib4(5)`, and `fib4(4)`.

4. **calculating fib4(8)**:
   - to find `fib4(8)`, we need to compute:
     - `fib4(7)`, `fib4(6)`, `fib4(5)`, and `fib4(4)`.
   - continuing this process recursively:
     - `fib4(4)` is computed as `fib4(3) + fib4(2) + fib4(1) + fib4(0) = 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 4`
     - `fib4(5)` is computed as `fib4(4) + fib4(3) + fib4(2) + fib4(1) = 4 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 8`
     - `fib4(6)` is computed as `fib4(5) + fib4(4) + fib4(3) + fib4(2) = 8 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 16`
     - `fib4(7)` is computed as `fib4(6) + fib4(5) + fib4(4) + fib4(3) = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30`
     - finally, `fib4(8)` is computed as `fib4(7) + fib4(6) + fib4(5) + fib4(4) = 30 + 16 + 8 + 4 = 58`

5. **final comparison**:
   - the assertion checks if `fib4(8) == 28`. from our calculations, we found that `fib4(8) = 58`, which does not equal `28`.

### conclusion
the assertion `assert (fib4(8) == 28);` fails because the computed value of `fib4(8)` is `58`, not `28`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
assert (fib4(10) == 104);,fail,"to analyze the assertion `assert (fib4(10) == 104);`, we need to understand the behavior of the function `fib4` as represented in the provided llvm ir code. the function appears to be an implementation of a fibonacci sequence calculation, but it has some optimizations and modifications that we need to consider.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function definition**:
   the function `fib4` is defined as `define dso_local i32 @_z4fib4i(i32 %0)`. the parameter `%0` represents the input to the fibonacci function.

2. **base cases**:
   the function checks if the input is less than 4:
   ```llvm
   %5 = icmp slt i32 %0, 4
   br i1 %5, label %34, label %6
   ```
   if `%0` is less than 4, it branches to label `%34`, which is not shown in the provided code snippet but likely handles the base cases of the fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2).

3. **recursive calculation**:
   for values of `%0` that are 4 or greater, the function performs calculations that involve recursive calls to compute fibonacci numbers. the relevant code sections involve loading values from an array and performing additions based on fibonacci properties.

4. **understanding the fibonacci calculation**:
   the fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - `fib(0) = 0`
   - `fib(1) = 1`
   - `fib(2) = 1`
   - `fib(3) = 2`
   - `fib(4) = 3`
   - `fib(5) = 5`
   - `fib(6) = 8`
   - `fib(7) = 13`
   - `fib(8) = 21`
   - `fib(9) = 34`
   - `fib(10) = 55`

   however, the assertion checks for `fib4(10) == 104`. 

5. **analyzing the result**:
   the expected result of `fib(10)` is `55`, not `104`. therefore, we need to check if the function `fib4` has any modifications that could lead to a different output. 

6. **conclusion**:
   given that the standard fibonacci sequence does not yield `104` for an input of `10`, and based on the analysis of the llvm ir code, it appears that the function is indeed calculating the fibonacci number correctly but does not produce `104` for the input `10`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
assert (fib4(12) == 386);,fail,"to analyze the assertion `assert (fib4(12) == 386);`, we need to understand what the provided llvm ir code does, particularly the function `_z4fib4i`, which corresponds to `fib4(int)`.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function appears to compute fibonacci numbers based on the name `fib4`. the fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - `fib(0) = 0`
   - `fib(1) = 1`
   - `fib(2) = 1`
   - `fib(3) = 2`
   - `fib(4) = 3`
   - `fib(5) = 5`
   - `fib(6) = 8`
   - `fib(7) = 13`
   - `fib(8) = 21`
   - `fib(9) = 34`
   - `fib(10) = 55`
   - `fib(11) = 89`
   - `fib(12) = 144`
   - continuing this way, we find that `fib(12)` should equal `144`.

2. **understanding the code**: 
   - the function uses an array of size 100 to store fibonacci values.
   - it checks if the input `n` is less than 4. if so, it handles base cases directly.
   - for values of `n` greater than or equal to 4, it computes fibonacci numbers iteratively and stores them in the array.
   - the final result is retrieved from the array based on the input index.

3. **expected output**: 
   - for the input `12`, the function should compute `fib(12)`, which we established is `144`.

4. **assertion evaluation**: 
   - the assertion checks if `fib4(12)` equals `386`. 
   - since we determined that `fib4(12)` actually equals `144`, the assertion `fib4(12) == 386` is false.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
