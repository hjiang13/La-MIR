"assert (rounded_avg(1, 5) == ""11"");",fail,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (rounded_avg(1, 5) == ""11"");`, we need to understand the behavior of the `rounded_avg` function as implemented in the provided llvm ir code. 

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function overview**: 
   - the function `rounded_avg` takes two integer parameters (`i32 %1` and `i32 %2`) and returns a `std::string` (represented as `%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""` in llvm ir).
   - the function appears to compute the average of the two integers and then formats the result into a string.

2. **control flow**:
   - the function starts by comparing the two integers with `icmp sgt i32 %1, %2`, which checks if the first integer is greater than the second. 
   - depending on the result of this comparison, the function branches to different blocks of code to handle the cases where one integer is greater than the other or not.

3. **calculating the average**:
   - in the block where `%1` is greater than `%2`, the average is computed as `(i32 %1 + i32 %2) / 2`.
   - in the block where `%1` is not greater than `%2`, the same average calculation is performed.
   - the average is then rounded using integer division.

4. **formatting the result**:
   - the result of the average calculation is passed to a function that formats it into a string. this is done using the `vsnprintf` function, which is called with the average value.
   - the formatted string is then stored in a `std::string` object.

5. **specific case analysis**:
   - for the specific inputs `1` and `5`, the average is calculated as `(1 + 5) / 2 = 3`.
   - the function then formats this average into a string.
   - the assertion checks if the result of `rounded_avg(1, 5)` equals `""11""`.

6. **conclusion**:
   - since the average of `1` and `5` is `3`, the function will format this value into a string, resulting in `""3""`, not `""11""`.
   - therefore, the assertion `assert (rounded_avg(1, 5) == ""11"");` will fail.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (rounded_avg(7, 13) == ""1010"");",fail,"to analyze the assertion `assert (rounded_avg(7, 13) == ""1010"");`, we need to understand what the function `rounded_avg` does based on the provided llvm ir code.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**: 
   the function `rounded_avg` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local void @_z11rounded_avgb5cxx11ii(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* noalias sret(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"") align 8 %0, i32 %1, i32 %2)
   ```
   this indicates that it takes a reference to a `std::string` (to store the result) and two integers as parameters.

2. **control flow**:
   - the function starts by comparing the two integers (`%1` and `%2`) using `icmp sgt`. if `%1` (7) is greater than `%2` (13), it branches to label `%8`, otherwise it goes to label `%15`.
   - since 7 is not greater than 13, we will follow the path to label `%15`.

3. **calculating the average**:
   - at label `%15`, it calculates the sum of the two integers:
     ```llvm
     %22 = add nsw i32 %2, %1
     ```
     this results in `22` (7 + 13).
   - it then checks if this sum is greater than 1:
     ```llvm
     %35 = icmp sgt i32 %22, 1
     ```
     since 22 is greater than 1, it branches to label `%36`.

4. **division**:
   - at label `%36`, it divides the sum by 2:
     ```llvm
     %44 = sdiv i32 %43, 2
     ```
     here, `%43` is assigned the value of `%22`, which is `22`. therefore, `22 / 2 = 11`.

5. **conversion to string**:
   - the function then calls `vsnprintf` to format the result into a string:
     ```llvm
     invoke void (%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""*, i32 (i8*, i64, i8*, %struct.__va_list_tag*)*, i64, i8*, ...) @_zn9__gnu_cxx12__to_xstringinst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeeceet_pfipt0_mpks8_p13__va_list_tagemsb_z(...)
     ```
   - the formatted string is expected to be the string representation of the average, which is `11`.

6. **final comparison**:
   - the assertion checks if the result of `rounded_avg(7, 13)` is equal to `""1010""`.
   - the calculated average is `11`, which is represented as `""11""` in string format, not `""1010""`.

### conclusion
since the expected result of the function `rounded_avg(7, 13)` is `""11""` and not `""1010""`, the assertion fails.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (rounded_avg(964,977) == ""1111001010"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion `assert (rounded_avg(964,977) == ""1111001010"");` based on the provided llvm ir code for the function `rounded_avg`, we need to understand what the function does and how it processes the inputs.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**:
   the function `rounded_avg` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local void @_z11rounded_avgb5cxx11ii(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* noalias sret(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"") align 8 %0, i32 %1, i32 %2)
   ```
   this indicates that it returns a `std::string` (c++ string) and takes two integers as parameters.

2. **input parameters**:
   the function takes two integers, which in our assertion are `964` and `977`. 

3. **logic inside the function**:
   - the function compares the two integers using `icmp sgt i32 %1, %2`, which checks if the first integer is greater than the second. in this case, `964` is not greater than `977`, so it will follow the branch labeled `%15`.
   - inside this branch, it initializes a string and performs some calculations. the key part of the function is the calculation of the average:
     ```llvm
     %22 = add nsw i32 %2, %1
     ```
     this adds the two integers together, resulting in `964 + 977 = 1941`.
   - the average is then calculated:
     ```llvm
     %44 = sdiv i32 %43, 2
     ```
     here, `%43` is the sum `1941`, and dividing by `2` gives `970.5`. however, since we are dealing with integers, the result of the division will be `970`.

4. **conversion to string**:
   the function then converts the integer result into a string representation. the relevant part of the code that handles this is:
   ```llvm
   %45 = srem i32 %44, 2
   ```
   this calculates the remainder when `970` is divided by `2`, which is `0`. the function then formats the string based on this value.

5. **expected output**:
   the assertion checks if the output of `rounded_avg(964, 977)` equals `""1111001010""`. the binary representation of `970` is `1111001010`, which matches the expected output.

### conclusion
based on the analysis of the llvm ir code, the function correctly computes the average of `964` and `977`, converts it to a string, and the assertion checks if this string equals `""1111001010""`. since the output matches the expected value, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (rounded_avg(996,997) == ""1111100100"");",pass,"to analyze whether the assertion `assert (rounded_avg(996, 997) == ""1111100100"");` passes or fails based on the provided llvm ir code, we need to understand the behavior of the `rounded_avg` function as implemented in the llvm ir.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**: 
   the function `rounded_avg` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local void @_z11rounded_avgb5cxx11ii(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* noalias sret(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"") align 8 %0, i32 %1, i32 %2)
   ```
   this indicates that it takes a reference to a `std::string` (to hold the result) and two integers (the values to average).

2. **control flow**:
   - the function starts by comparing the two integers `%1` and `%2` (which correspond to `996` and `997`).
   - it uses an `icmp` instruction to check if `%1` is greater than `%2`. since `996` is not greater than `997`, the control flow will go to the label `%15`.

3. **calculating the average**:
   - in the block starting with label `%15`, the function calculates the sum of the two integers:
     ```llvm
     %22 = add nsw i32 %2, %1
     ```
     this results in `996 + 997 = 1993`.
   - next, it checks if the sum is greater than `1`:
     ```llvm
     %35 = icmp sgt i32 %22, 1
     ```
     since `1993` is greater than `1`, it proceeds to label `%36`.

4. **division**:
   - the average is calculated by dividing the sum by `2`:
     ```llvm
     %44 = sdiv i32 %43, 2
     ```
     here, `%43` is `1993`, so the average is `1993 / 2 = 996.5`. however, since this is integer division, it will truncate to `996`.

5. **string conversion**:
   - the function then prepares to convert this average into a string representation. it uses a function call to `vsnprintf` to format the number into a string.
   - the string representation of `996` in binary is `1111100100`.

6. **final result**:
   - the function ultimately returns a string that represents the binary form of the average. the assertion checks if this string is equal to `""1111100100""`.

### conclusion
since the average of `996` and `997` is indeed `996`, and its binary representation is `1111100100`, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (rounded_avg(560,851) == ""1011000001"");",fail,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (rounded_avg(560,851) == ""1011000001"");`, we need to understand what the function `rounded_avg` does based on the provided llvm ir code.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**:
   the function `rounded_avg` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local void @_z11rounded_avgb5cxx11ii(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* noalias sret(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"") align 8 %0, i32 %1, i32 %2)
   ```
   it takes three parameters:
   - a reference to a `std::string` (the output string).
   - two integers, which are the inputs for the average calculation.

2. **input values**:
   the assertion tests the function with the inputs `560` and `851`.

3. **logic of the function**:
   - the function first compares the two integers:
     ```llvm
     %7 = icmp sgt i32 %1, %2
     br i1 %7, label %8, label %15
     ```
     since `560` is less than `851`, the control will go to label `%15`.

4. **calculating the average**:
   - in the block starting with label `%15`, the function calculates the sum of the two integers:
     ```llvm
     %22 = add nsw i32 %2, %1
     ```
     this results in `560 + 851 = 1411`.
   - the average is then calculated:
     ```llvm
     %44 = sdiv i32 %43, 2
     ```
     this results in `1411 / 2 = 705` (integer division).

5. **output conversion**:
   - the function then converts the average to a string representation. the relevant part of the code is:
     ```llvm
     %45 = srem i32 %44, 2
     invoke void ... @vsnprintf(...)
     ```
     the average `705` is converted to a string. the binary representation of `705` is `1011001001`.

6. **final output**:
   - the function returns the string representation of the average. the assertion checks if this string equals `""1011000001""`, which is incorrect since the actual binary representation of `705` is `1011001001`.

### conclusion
the assertion `assert (rounded_avg(560,851) == ""1011000001"");` fails because the expected output does not match the actual output of the function.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (rounded_avg(185,546) == ""101101101"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion statement based on the provided llvm ir code, we need to understand what the function `rounded_avg` is doing and what the expected output is.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**:
   the function `rounded_avg` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local void @_z11rounded_avgb5cxx11ii(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* noalias sret(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"") align 8 %0, i32 %1, i32 %2)
   ```
   this indicates that it takes a reference to a `std::string` (for the output) and two integers as input parameters.

2. **input parameters**:
   the assertion checks the output of `rounded_avg(185, 546)`. therefore, `i32 %1` will be 185 and `i32 %2` will be 546.

3. **control flow**:
   the function first compares the two integers:
   ```llvm
   %7 = icmp sgt i32 %1, %2
   br i1 %7, label %8, label %15
   ```
   since 185 is not greater than 546, the control will go to label `%15`.

4. **handling the case**:
   at label `%15`, the function initializes some values and calculates the average:
   ```llvm
   %22 = add nsw i32 %2, %1
   ```
   this adds the two integers, resulting in `185 + 546 = 731`.

5. **division**:
   the average is calculated as:
   ```llvm
   %44 = sdiv i32 %43, 2
   ```
   here, `%43` is the sum (731), so the average is `731 / 2 = 365`.

6. **string conversion**:
   the function then converts this average into a string representation. the relevant part of the code that handles this is:
   ```llvm
   invoke void (%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""*, i32 (i8*, i64, i8*, %struct.__va_list_tag*)*, i64, i8*, ...) @_zn9__gnu_cxx12__to_xstringinst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeeceet_pfipt0_mpks8_p13__va_list_tagemsb_z(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* nonnull sret(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"") align 8 %6, ...)
   ```
   the average value (365) will be formatted into a string.

7. **expected output**:
   the assertion checks if the output string is `""101101101""`. however, the string representation of the integer `365` in binary is `101101101`. 

### conclusion
the function correctly computes the average of the two integers and converts it to a string. therefore, the assertion:
```cpp
assert (rounded_avg(185,546) == ""101101101"");
```
is valid.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (rounded_avg(362,496) == ""110101101"");",pass,"to analyze whether the assertion `assert (rounded_avg(362,496) == ""110101101"");` passes or fails based on the provided llvm ir code, we need to break down the function `rounded_avg` and understand its behavior.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**: 
   the function `rounded_avg` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local void @_z11rounded_avgb5cxx11ii(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* noalias sret(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"") align 8 %0, i32 %1, i32 %2)
   ```
   this indicates that it takes a string (likely to return the result) and two integers as inputs.

2. **input values**: 
   the assertion is testing the function with the values `362` and `496`.

3. **logic inside the function**:
   - the function starts by comparing the two integers:
     ```llvm
     %7 = icmp sgt i32 %1, %2
     br i1 %7, label %8, label %15
     ```
     since `362` is less than `496`, it will branch to label `%15`.

4. **branch `%15` logic**:
   - in this branch, the function initializes a string and prepares to calculate the average:
     ```llvm
     %22 = add nsw i32 %2, %1
     ```
     this computes the sum of `362` and `496`, which is `858`.

5. **calculating the average**:
   - the average is calculated as:
     ```llvm
     %44 = sdiv i32 %43, 2
     ```
     here, `%43` would be `858`, and dividing by `2` gives `429`.

6. **conversion to binary**:
   - the function then appears to convert the average (429) to a binary string representation. the binary representation of `429` is `110101101`.

7. **returning the result**:
   - the function eventually returns this string representation.

### conclusion
the assertion checks if the output of `rounded_avg(362, 496)` is equal to the string `""110101101""`. given the analysis, we see that the function correctly computes the average, converts it to binary, and matches the expected output.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (rounded_avg(350,902) == ""1001110010"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion statement based on the provided llvm ir code, we need to understand the function `rounded_avg` and what it is supposed to compute. the assertion checks if the result of `rounded_avg(350, 902)` equals the string `""1001110010""`.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `rounded_avg` appears to compute the average of two integers, `350` and `902`. the average can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{average} = \frac{a + b}{2}
   \]
   where \( a = 350 \) and \( b = 902 \).

2. **calculating the average**:
   - first, we compute the sum:
     \[
     350 + 902 = 1252
     \]
   - next, we divide by 2 to find the average:
     \[
     \text{average} = \frac{1252}{2} = 626
     \]

3. **converting the average to binary**:
   - the next step is to convert the decimal average `626` to binary.
   - the binary representation of `626` is `1001110010`.

4. **assertion check**: the assertion checks if the output of `rounded_avg(350, 902)` is equal to the string `""1001110010""`. since we calculated that the average is indeed `626`, and its binary representation is `1001110010`, the assertion holds true.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (rounded_avg(197,233) == ""11010111"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion `assert (rounded_avg(197,233) == ""11010111"");` based on the provided llvm ir code for the function `rounded_avg`, we need to understand what the function does and how it processes its inputs.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**: 
   the function `rounded_avg` takes three parameters:
   - a pointer to a `std::string` (used to store the result).
   - two integers (`i32`), which in this case are `197` and `233`.

2. **control flow**:
   - the function starts by comparing the two integers (`%1` and `%2`), which correspond to `197` and `233`. since `197` is not greater than `233`, it will follow the control flow to label `%15`.

3. **calculating the average**:
   - in the branch labeled `%15`, the function calculates the sum of the two integers: `22 = 197 + 233`.
   - it then checks if this sum is greater than `1`. since `430` is greater than `1`, it goes to label `%36`.

4. **division and rounding**:
   - at label `%36`, it divides the sum by `2` to get the average: `average = 430 / 2 = 215`.
   - the result of the division is stored in a variable.

5. **conversion to string**:
   - the function then prepares to convert the average (215) to a string representation in binary format. the binary representation of `215` is `11010111`.

6. **final result**:
   - the function constructs a `std::string` containing the binary representation of `215`, which is `11010111`.

7. **assertion check**:
   - the assertion checks if the result of `rounded_avg(197, 233)` is equal to the string `""11010111""`.
   - since the function correctly computes the average and converts it to the expected binary string, the assertion should pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (rounded_avg(7, 5) == ""-1"");",fail,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (rounded_avg(7, 5) == ""-1"");` based on the provided llvm ir code for the function `rounded_avg`, we need to break down the llvm ir code and understand what the function is doing.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**: the function `rounded_avg` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local void @_z11rounded_avgb5cxx11ii(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* noalias sret(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"") align 8 %0, i32 %1, i32 %2)
   ```
   this indicates that the function takes a reference to a `std::string` as its first argument (to hold the result) and two integers as the second and third arguments.

2. **control flow**: the function starts by comparing the two integers:
   ```llvm
   %7 = icmp sgt i32 %1, %2
   br i1 %7, label %8, label %15
   ```
   if `7 > 5`, it will branch to label `%8`, otherwise to label `%15`.

3. **branching logic**:
   - **label `%8`**: this block handles the case where the first integer is greater than the second. it sets up a string with a specific value.
   - **label `%15`**: this block handles the case where the first integer is not greater than the second. it initializes a different string.

4. **string construction**:
   - in label `%8`, it appears to store a value (12589) in a specific part of the string structure, which likely corresponds to the string representation of the average.
   - in label `%15`, it initializes the string with a different value.

5. **final result**: the function eventually returns a string representation of the average of the two integers. given the input values `7` and `5`, the average would be `(7 + 5) / 2 = 6`. however, the rounding logic and how the string is constructed based on the average is crucial.

6. **assertion check**: the assertion checks if the result of `rounded_avg(7, 5)` equals `""-1""`. given the average of `7` and `5` is `6`, the function should not return `""-1""`.

### conclusion
based on the analysis, the function `rounded_avg` does not return `""-1""` when called with the arguments `7` and `5`. instead, it should return a string representation of the average, which is `""6""`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (rounded_avg(5, 1) == ""-1"");",fail,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (rounded_avg(5, 1) == ""-1"");` based on the provided llvm ir code for the function `rounded_avg`, we need to understand what the function is doing and what its expected output is.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**: 
   the function `rounded_avg` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local void @_z11rounded_avgb5cxx11ii(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* noalias sret(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"") align 8 %0, i32 %1, i32 %2)
   ```
   this indicates that the function takes a reference to a `std::string` (to store the result) and two integers as parameters.

2. **function logic**:
   - the function starts by comparing the two integers `%1` and `%2` (which correspond to the inputs `5` and `1`).
   - it checks if `5 > 1`, which is true, so it enters the first branch of the conditional.
   - inside this branch, it performs some operations to store values in the `std::string` object passed as the first argument.
   - the function appears to calculate an average based on the two integers, but the exact logic is obscured by the complexity of the llvm ir.

3. **key operations**:
   - the function computes the sum of the two integers (`%22 = add nsw i32 %2, %1`), which results in `6`.
   - it then checks if this sum is greater than `1` and continues processing.
   - the function eventually calls `vsnprintf`, which suggests it formats a string based on the computed average.

4. **expected output**:
   - the assertion checks if the output of `rounded_avg(5, 1)` is equal to the string `""-1""`.
   - given that the function calculates an average, we need to determine what the average of `5` and `1` is. the average is `(5 + 1) / 2 = 3`.
   - the function seems to be designed to return a string representation of the average, but the assertion expects `""-1""`.

5. **conclusion**:
   - since the average of `5` and `1` is `3`, and the assertion checks for `""-1""`, the assertion will fail.
   - the function does not seem to have any logic that would lead to a return value of `""-1""` for the inputs `5` and `1`.

"assert (rounded_avg(5, 5) == ""101"");",fail,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (rounded_avg(5, 5) == ""101"");` based on the provided llvm ir code for the function `rounded_avg`, we need to understand what the function is doing and what its output is when called with the arguments `5` and `5`.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function signature**: 
   the function `rounded_avg` is defined as:
   ```llvm
   define dso_local void @_z11rounded_avgb5cxx11ii(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string""* noalias sret(%""class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"") align 8 %0, i32 %1, i32 %2)
   ```
   this indicates that it takes a reference to a `std::string` (as the first argument) and two integers (the second and third arguments).

2. **control flow**:
   - the function starts by comparing the two integers `%1` and `%2` (which correspond to the inputs `5` and `5`).
   - the comparison `icmp sgt i32 %1, %2` checks if `5 > 5`, which is false. therefore, the control flow will go to the label `%15`.

3. **handling the else case**:
   - in the block starting with label `%15`, the function prepares to compute the average of the two integers.
   - it calculates `add nsw i32 %2, %1`, which results in `5 + 5 = 10`.
   - then, it checks if `10 > 1` (which is true) and proceeds to compute the average.

4. **calculating the average**:
   - the average is computed as `sdiv i32 %43, 2`, where `%43` is the sum of the two integers (which is `10`).
   - thus, `10 / 2 = 5`.

5. **formatting the output**:
   - the function then calls `vsnprintf` to format the output string. the formatted string is built based on the average value calculated.
   - the average value `5` is converted to a string and stored in the `std::string` object.

6. **final output**:
   - the formatted string that is produced by the function is `""5""`, not `""101""`.

### conclusion
the assertion `assert (rounded_avg(5, 5) == ""101"");` is checking if the output of `rounded_avg(5, 5)` is equal to `""101""`. since the actual output is `""5""`, the assertion fails.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
