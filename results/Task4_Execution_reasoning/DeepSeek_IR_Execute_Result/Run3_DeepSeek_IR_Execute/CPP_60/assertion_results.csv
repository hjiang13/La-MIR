assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the assertion `sum_to_n(1) == 1` passes or fails based on the provided LLVM IR code. Let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` is doing.

Looking at the LLVM IR code, the function is named `_Z8sum_to_ni`, which I think is the mangled name for `sum_to_n`. The function takes an `i32` argument, which is a 32-bit integer. Let me break down the code step by step.

First, the function starts by adding 1 to the input value `%0` and storing it in `%2`. So, if the input is 1, `%2` becomes 2. Then, it multiplies `%2` by `%0`, which would be 2 * 1 = 2, and stores that in `%3`. Next, it performs a signed division of `%3` by 2, so 2 / 2 equals 1, which is stored in `%4`. Finally, the function returns `%4`, which is 1.

Wait, but the assertion is checking if `sum_to_n(1)` equals 1. According to this calculation, it does. So the assertion should pass.

But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The function seems to be calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n*(n+1)/2. For n=1, that's 1*(1+1)/2 = 1, which matches the assertion.

I don't see any issues here. The code correctly computes the sum, and the assertion should hold true.

The function `sum_to_n` correctly computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. For `n=1`, the result is 1, which satisfies the assertion.

assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,pass,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the assertion sum_to_n(6) == 21 passes or fails based on the provided LLVM IR code. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

Looking at the function name, sum_to_n, I'm guessing it's calculating the sum of integers from 1 to n. The formula for that sum is n*(n+1)/2. So for n=6, the sum should be 6*7/2 = 21, which matches the assertion.

Now, let's look at the LLVM IR code to see if it's implementing this correctly. The function is defined as @_Z8sum_to_ni, which I think is the mangled name for sum_to_n taking an integer.

The function takes an i32 parameter %0. The first instruction is %2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1. So that's adding 1 to the input, which would be n+1. Then %3 is the product of %2 and %0, so that's n*(n+1). Next, %4 is the result of dividing %3 by 2 using signed division. Finally, it returns %4.

Putting it all together, the function computes (n*(n+1))/2, which is exactly the formula for the sum of the first n integers. So when n is 6, it should return 21.

I don't see any issues with the code. The operations are correct, and the division is using sdiv, which is signed division, but since the result is positive, it shouldn't cause any problems. Also, the nsw (no signed wrap) attribute is used, which means it's assuming that the addition and multiplication don't cause overflow. For n=6, that's definitely not a problem.

So the function should correctly return 21 when given 6 as input, making the assertion pass.

The function `_Z8sum_to_ni` correctly computes the sum of the first `n` integers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. For `n=6`, this results in 21, so the assertion passes.

assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,pass,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the assertion sum_to_n(11) == 66 passes or fails based on the provided LLVM IR code. Let me start by understanding what the function is doing.

Looking at the LLVM IR code, the function is named @_Z8sum_to_ni, which I think is the mangled name for sum_to_n. It takes an i32 parameter %0, which is the input n. The function is supposed to compute the sum from 1 to n.

Let me break down the code step by step. The first instruction is %2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1. So that's adding 1 to n. Then, %3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0, which multiplies (n+1) by n. Next, %4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2, which divides that product by 2. Finally, it returns %4.

Wait, that formula (n*(n+1))/2 is exactly the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. So the function is correctly implementing sum_to_n.

Now, the assertion is sum_to_n(11) == 66. Let me compute that manually. 11*12 is 132, divided by 2 is 66. So the function should return 66 when given 11.

But wait, I should check if there's any overflow or issues with the data types. The function uses i32, which is a 32-bit integer. Let's see: 11 is small, so 11*12 is 132, which is well within the range of i32 (which can hold up to around 2 billion). So no overflow here.

Also, the operations are using nsw (no signed wrap), which means that if there were an overflow, it would be undefined behavior, but since 11 is small, that's not a problem here.

So putting it all together, the function correctly computes the sum, and for n=11, it returns 66. Therefore, the assertion should pass.

The function `sum_to_n` correctly computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `(n*(n+1))/2`. For `n=11`, the calculation is `11*12/2 = 66`, which matches the assertion.

assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,pass,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the assertion sum_to_n(30) == 465 passes or fails based on the given LLVM IR code. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

Looking at the function name, it's called sum_to_n, which suggests it's summing numbers up to n. The function takes an i32 parameter, which is a 32-bit integer, and returns an i32 as well.

Now, let me look at the LLVM IR code step by step. The function is defined as @_Z8sum_to_ni, which I think is the mangled name for sum_to_n. The function has some attributes like mustprogress, nofree, etc., but I can ignore those for now.

The code inside the function is:

%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1
%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0
%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2
ret i32 %4

So, let's break this down. %0 is the input parameter, which is n. 

First, %2 is calculated by adding 1 to %0. So that's n + 1.

Then, %3 is the product of %2 and %0, which is (n + 1) * n.

Next, %4 is the result of dividing %3 by 2 using signed division. So that's (n*(n+1))/2.

Finally, the function returns %4.

Wait a minute, that formula (n*(n+1))/2 is the sum of the first n natural numbers. So sum_to_n(n) should compute 1 + 2 + ... + n, which is exactly what this formula does.

Now, the assertion is sum_to_n(30) == 465. Let's compute that.

Using the formula: (30 * 31)/2 = 930 / 2 = 465. So the result should indeed be 465.

But wait, I should check if there's any possible issue with integer overflow or the operations used. The function uses 'nsw' which stands for 'no signed wrap', meaning that the operation doesn't wrap around on overflow. But since 30 is a small number, 30*31 is 930, which is well within the 32-bit integer range (since 2^31 is 2,147,483,648). So no overflow occurs here.

Also, the division is a signed division, but since the result is positive, it doesn't matter. So the function should correctly return 465 when given 30 as input.

Therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

The function computes the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula (n*(n+1))/2. For n=30, this correctly results in 465.

assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the assertion sum_to_n(100) == 5050 passes or fails based on the given LLVM IR code. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called _Z8sum_to_ni, which I think is the mangled name for sum_to_n. It takes an i32 parameter, which is a 32-bit integer, and returns an i32. The function is supposed to compute the sum of the first n natural numbers. The formula for that is n*(n+1)/2. So for n=100, the sum should be 100*101/2 = 5050, which matches the assertion.

Looking at the LLVM IR code, let's break it down step by step. The function starts by adding 1 to the input parameter %0, which is n. So %2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1. That gives us n+1.

Next, it multiplies %2 by %0, which is n*(n+1). So %3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0. Then, it performs a signed division by 2, so %4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2. Finally, it returns %4.

Wait, but I should check the arithmetic to make sure there's no overflow or issues with the operations. Let's compute it for n=100. 100 + 1 is 101, multiplied by 100 gives 10100. Divided by 2 is 5050, which is correct. So the function should return 5050 when given 100.

I should also consider the data types. All operations are on i32, and 100 is within the range of i32. The multiplication of 100 and 101 is 10100, which is 0x2774 in hex. Since i32 can handle up to around 2 billion, this is well within the limit, so no overflow occurs here.

The division is a signed division, but since 10100 is even, it should divide cleanly without any issues. So the result is exactly 5050.

Therefore, the function should correctly compute the sum, and the assertion should pass.
</think>

The function `_Z8sum_to_ni` correctly computes the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula n*(n+1)/2. For n=100, it calculates 100*101/2 = 5050 without overflow or division issues. Thus, the assertion passes.
