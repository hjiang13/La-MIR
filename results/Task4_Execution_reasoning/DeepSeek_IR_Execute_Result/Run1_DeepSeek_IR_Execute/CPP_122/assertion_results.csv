"assert (add_elements({1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99}, 3) == -4);",pass,"<think>
Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the assertion `add_elements({1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99}, 3) == -4` passes or fails based on the provided LLVM IR code. 

First, I need to understand what the `add_elements` function does. Looking at the IR code, the function takes a vector of integers and an integer `%1`, which in this case is 3. The function is supposed to add 99 to each element in the vector, but only if the element is less than 199 after adding 99. Then, it sums all the elements that meet this condition and returns the total.

Wait, no, looking closer, the code seems to be adding 99 to elements and checking if the result is less than 199. If it is, the original element is added to the sum. So for each element `x` in the vector, if `x + 99 < 199`, then `x` is included in the sum.

Let me break it down step by step.

The vector passed is `{1, -2, -3, 41, 57, 76, 87, 88, 99}`. Let's compute `x + 99` for each element and check if it's less than 199.

1. 1 + 99 = 100 < 199 → include 1.
2. -2 + 99 = 97 < 199 → include -2.
3. -3 + 99 = 96 < 199 → include -3.
4. 41 + 99 = 140 < 199 → include 41.
5. 57 + 99 = 156 < 199 → include 57.
6. 76 + 99 = 175 < 199 → include 76.
7. 87 + 99 = 186 < 199 → include 87.
8. 88 + 99 = 187 < 199 → include 88.
9. 99 + 99 = 198 < 199 → include 99.

Wait, all elements when added to 99 give a result less than 199. So all elements are included. Now, summing all of them:

1 + (-2) + (-3) + 41 + 57 + 76 + 87 + 88 + 99.

Let me calculate this:

1 -2 = -1
-1 -3 = -4
-4 +41 = 37
37 +57 = 94
94 +76 = 170
170 +87 = 257
257 +88 = 345
345 +99 = 444.

So the sum should be 444. But the assertion expects -4. That's a big discrepancy. So why is the function returning -4?

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the function's logic. Let me look at the IR code again.

Looking at the IR, the function uses SIMD instructions to process the vector in chunks of 4 elements. It adds 99 to each element and checks if the result is less than 199. If so, it includes the original element in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the function is only processing the first 3 elements because the second argument is 3. Oh, wait, the function's second argument is `i32 %1`, which is the number of elements to process. So in the assertion, it's 3, meaning only the first 3 elements are considered.

Ah, that's a crucial point. So the function adds 99 to each of the first 3 elements and checks if each is less than 199. Then, it sums those elements that meet the condition.

So the first three elements are 1, -2, -3.

1 +99 = 100 <199 → include 1.
-2 +99 =97 <199 → include -2.
-3 +99=96 <199 → include -3.

Sum: 1 + (-2) + (-3) = -4.

That matches the assertion's expected result of -4. So the function should return -4, making the assertion pass.

Wait, but earlier I thought the function processes the entire vector. But looking at the IR code, the loop seems to iterate based on the value of `%1`, which is 3. So it's only processing the first 3 elements. That makes sense now.

So the function correctly sums the first 3 elements, giving -4, which matches the assertion. Therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

The function `add_elements` processes the first 3 elements of the vector, adding 99 to each and summing those that meet the condition. The sum is -4, matching the assertion.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (add_elements({111,121,3,4000,5,6}, 2) == 0);",pass,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the assertion `add_elements({111,121,3,4000,5,6}, 2) == 0` passes or fails based on the provided LLVM IR code. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand what the function `add_elements` is supposed to do. From the function name and the parameters, it seems like it's adding elements to a vector, but the specifics aren't clear. The function takes a vector of integers and an integer, and returns an integer. The assertion is checking if the result is zero when the vector is `{111,121,3,4000,5,6}` and the integer is 2.

Looking at the LLVM IR code, the function is named `@_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi`, which I think is the mangled name for `add_elements`. The function is decorated with several attributes like `mustprogress`, `nofree`, etc., which probably relate to optimization and safety.

The function starts by comparing the input integer `%1` (which is 2 in our case) with 0. Since 2 is greater than 0, it branches to label 4.

At label 4, it gets the element pointer of the vector. The vector's data is accessed through a series of getelementptr instructions. It loads the pointer to the data, which is the actual array inside the vector.

Then, it checks if `%1` (2) is less than 8. Since 2 is less than 8, it branches to label 83. Wait, no, looking again, the code says `br i1 %8, label %83, label %9`. So if `%8` is true (which it is, because 2 < 8), it goes to label 83.

Wait, but label 83 is part of the code that seems to handle the case when the input is less than 8. Let me see what label 83 does.

At label 83, it's a phi node that initializes some variables. Then it branches to label 88. Label 88 seems to be a loop that processes elements one by one because the vector size is small (less than 8 elements). 

In the loop at label 88, it gets each element, adds 99 to it, checks if the result is less than 199, and if so, adds the original value to the sum; otherwise, it adds 0. So for each element, if (element +99) <199, then include it in the sum.

Wait, let me parse that. The code in the loop (label 88) does:

- Load the current element.
- Add 99 to it.
- Check if the result is less than 199.
- If yes, select the original element; else, 0.
- Add this to the running total.

So the function is summing all elements in the vector where (element +99) <199, which simplifies to element <100.

So for each element in the vector, if the element is less than 100, it's added to the sum; otherwise, it's not.

Now, let's apply this to the vector {111,121,3,4000,5,6} with the second argument being 2. Wait, but the function's second argument is an integer, and in the code, it's used to determine the loop count or condition. Wait, no, looking back, the function's second argument is %1, which is 2 in the assertion. But in the code, the function seems to process the entire vector regardless of %1, except for the initial branch based on whether %1 is greater than 0.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the code.

The function starts by checking if %1 > 0. If yes, proceed. Then, it checks if %1 <8. Since 2 is less than 8, it goes to label 83, which then goes to label 88.

In label 88, it's a loop that iterates over each element of the vector, processing one by one. The loop variable %89 starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches %7, which is the value of %1 (2) converted to i64. Wait, no, %7 is zext i32 %1 to i64, which is 2. So the loop runs from 0 to 1 (since it's <2), processing two elements.

Wait, that can't be right because the vector has 6 elements. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the loop condition.

Wait, in the loop at label 88, the condition is whether %97 (which is %89 +1) equals %7 (which is 2). So the loop runs while %89 is less than 2. So it processes elements 0 and 1, i.e., the first two elements of the vector.

Wait, that would mean that only the first two elements are processed, and the rest are ignored. But that doesn't make sense because the function is supposed to process the entire vector. Or perhaps the function is designed to process only a certain number of elements based on the second argument.

Wait, the function's second argument is 2 in the assertion. So perhaps it's adding elements up to the second argument's value. Or maybe it's processing the first %1 elements.

Looking back, the loop in label 88 starts with %89 = 0, and each iteration increments by 1, until %89 reaches %7, which is 2. So it processes elements 0 and 1, i.e., the first two elements of the vector.

So in the vector {111,121,3,4000,5,6}, the first two elements are 111 and 121.

Now, for each of these elements, the function checks if (element +99) <199. Let's compute:

For 111: 111 +99 = 210, which is not less than 199. So it's not added.

For 121: 121 +99 = 220, also not less than 199. So not added.

So the sum would be 0 + 0 = 0.

Hence, the function returns 0, which matches the assertion.

Wait, but what about the other elements? The function only processes the first two because the second argument is 2. So the function is summing the first N elements where N is the second argument, but only if they meet the condition.

So in this case, since both 111 and 121 are >=100, their contributions are 0. So the total is 0, which makes the assertion pass.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the function's name is `add_elements`, which suggests it's adding elements to the vector, but the code seems to be summing elements based on a condition. Alternatively, perhaps the function is summing elements that meet a certain condition, but only for the first N elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is processing all elements, but the loop in label 88 is only for when the vector size is small, and the other part (label 16 onwards) is for when the vector is larger and can be processed in chunks of 4 elements using SIMD.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the function has two parts: one for small vectors (size <8) and another for larger vectors, processing them in SIMD blocks.

In the case where the vector size is less than 8, it processes each element individually in the loop at label 88. Otherwise, it processes them in groups of 4 using vector instructions.

But in our case, the vector has 6 elements, which is more than 8? No, 6 is less than 8. So the code would take the label 83 path, leading to label 88, and process each element up to the value of %1, which is 2.

Wait, but that would mean only the first two elements are processed. But the vector has 6 elements, so why isn't the loop processing all of them?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the role of %1. Let me check the function signature again. The function is declared as `i32 @_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi(%""class.std::vector""* nocapture readonly %0, i32 %1)`. So the second argument is an integer, perhaps indicating how many elements to process or a condition based on that.

Wait, perhaps the function is designed to process the first %1 elements of the vector, but only if they meet the condition. So in the assertion, %1 is 2, so it processes the first two elements.

In that case, as calculated earlier, both 111 and 121 are >=100, so their contributions are 0. So the sum is 0, making the assertion pass.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is processing all elements, but the code is structured to handle small and large vectors differently. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial check is whether %1 >0. Since it is, it proceeds. Then, it checks if %1 <8. Since 2<8, it goes to label 83, which then goes to label 88. The loop in label 88 runs from 0 to %1-1, i.e., 0 and 1, processing the first two elements.

So the function is summing the first %1 elements that meet the condition (element <100). In this case, the first two elements are 111 and 121, both >=100, so sum is 0.

Therefore, the assertion `add_elements({111,121,3,4000,5,6}, 2) == 0` would evaluate to true, so the assertion passes.

Wait, but what if the function is supposed to process all elements regardless of %1? Then the analysis would be different. But looking at the code, the loop in label 88 is controlled by %1, so it's processing the first %1 elements.

Alternatively, perhaps %1 is the number of elements in the vector. But in the function, the vector is passed as a parameter, so the function should know its size. But in the code, it's not accessing the vector's size; instead, it's using %1 as the loop count.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the function's second argument is an integer, not necessarily the size of the vector. So perhaps the function is designed to process the first %1 elements of the vector, regardless of the vector's actual size.

In that case, in the assertion, it's processing the first 2 elements of the vector, which are 111 and 121. Both are >=100, so their contributions are 0. So the sum is 0, making the assertion pass.

But I'm a bit confused because the function's name suggests adding elements, but the code seems to be summing based on a condition. Maybe the function is supposed to count how many elements meet a certain condition, but in this case, it's summing their values if they meet the condition.

Wait, looking at the code again, in the loop at label 88, it's adding the element to the sum only if (element +99) <199, which is equivalent to element <100. So for each element in the processed range, if it's less than 100, it's added to the sum; otherwise, 0 is added.

In the assertion, the first two elements are 111 and 121, both >=100, so they contribute 0 each. So the total sum is 0, which matches the assertion.

Therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

The function processes the first two elements of the vector, checking if each is less than 100. Since both are 111 and 121, which are not less than 100, their contributions are zero. Thus, the sum is zero, making the assertion true.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (add_elements({11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 125);",pass,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine whether the assertion `add_elements({11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 125` passes or fails based on the provided LLVM IR code. Let me try to understand what the function `add_elements` is doing.

First, looking at the function signature: it takes a `std::vector<int>` and an `int`, and returns an `int`. The function is named `add_elements`, so I'm guessing it adds something to the elements of the vector and returns a sum or count.

Looking at the IR code, the function starts with an `icmp sgt` on `%1` (which is the second argument, the `int`). So if `%1` is greater than 0, it branches to label 4, else to label 86. Label 86 seems to be the exit point where it returns `%87`, which is initialized to 0. So if `%1` is 0 or negative, the function returns 0.

In the assertion, `%1` is 4, which is greater than 0, so the function proceeds to label 4.

At label 4, it gets the element pointer of the vector. The vector's data is accessed via `%5 = getelementptr ...`, which seems to be accessing the underlying array. Then it loads the pointer into `%6`.

Next, it checks if `%1` (4) is less than 8. Since 4 < 8, it branches to label 83. Wait, no, the code says `br i1 %8, label %83, label %9`. So if `%8` is true (4 < 8), it goes to 83, else to 9. So in this case, it goes to label 83.

Wait, no, looking again: label 4 is where it starts after the initial check. Then it computes `%7 = zext i32 %1 to i64`, which is 4 extended to 64 bits. Then `%8 = icmp ult i32 %1, 8` which is true because 4 < 8. So it branches to label 83.

Label 83 is a phi node that seems to handle the case where the loop isn't entered. It initializes `%84` to 0 and `%85` to 0, then branches to label 88.

Label 88 is a loop. It loads the element at `%91`, adds 99 to it, checks if it's less than 199. If so, it keeps the value; else, it uses 0. Then it adds this to `%90` and increments `%97` by 1. It loops until `%97` equals `%7` (which is 4).

So in this case, the loop runs 4 times. Each time, it takes an element from the vector, adds 99, checks if it's less than 199, and if so, adds it to the sum.

Wait, but the vector in the assertion has 9 elements: {11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9}. So when the function is called with this vector and 4, it will process the first 4 elements.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The function's second argument is `n`, which in the assertion is 4. So the function is supposed to add elements up to `n` times or process `n` elements.

Looking at the loop in label 88: it starts with `%89` as 0 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `%7` which is 4. So it will loop 4 times, processing 4 elements.

Each iteration, it takes the i-th element (starting from 0), adds 99, and if the result is less than 199, it adds the original element to the sum. Wait, no: the code does `add i32 %92, 99` into `%93`, then checks if `%93` is less than 199. If yes, it selects `%92` (the original value), else 0. Then it adds this to `%90`.

Wait, no: the code is `%95 = select i1 %94, i32 %92, i32 0`. So if the condition is true (i.e., `%93` is less than 199), it takes `%92` (the original value), else 0. Then `%96 = add nsw i32 %95, %90` accumulates this into the sum.

Wait, but in the assertion, the function is supposed to return the sum of elements after adding 99, but only if the result is less than 199. Or maybe it's counting how many elements satisfy that condition.

Wait, no, looking at the code, it's adding the original value if the condition is met. So for each element in the first `n` elements, if (element +99) <199, then add the element to the sum. Otherwise, add 0.

So the sum is the sum of elements where element +99 <199, which simplifies to element <100.

So for each of the first `n` elements, if the element is less than 100, add it to the sum.

In the assertion, the vector is {11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9}, and `n` is 4. So the first 4 elements are 11,21,3,90.

Check each:

11: 11 <100 → add 11.

21: 21 <100 → add 21.

3: 3 <100 → add 3.

90: 90 <100 → add 90.

Sum: 11+21=32; +3=35; +90=125.

So the sum is 125, which matches the assertion.

Therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

The function processes the first `n` elements of the vector, adding each element to the sum if it is less than 100. For the given input, the sum is 125, so the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (add_elements({111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 24);",pass,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the assertion `add_elements({111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 24` passes or fails based on the provided LLVM IR code. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what the `add_elements` function is supposed to do. From the function name, it seems like it's adding elements to a vector, but looking at the code, it's more about processing the elements in some way. The function takes a vector of integers and an integer, and returns an integer.

Looking at the LLVM IR code, the function starts by checking if the input `i32 %1` (which is the second argument, 4 in the assertion) is greater than 0. If not, it branches to label 86, which seems to be the exit point. So, since 4 is positive, it proceeds.

Next, it gets the element pointer of the vector. The vector's data is accessed through a series of getelementptr instructions. It loads the data pointer into `%6`, which is the underlying array of the vector.

Then, it checks if `%1` (4) is less than 8. Since 4 is less than 8, it branches to label 83. Wait, no, looking again, the code after label 4 checks if %1 is less than 8. If so, it goes to label 83, else to label 9. So for 4, it goes to label 83.

Wait, no, the code after label 4 is:

%8 = icmp ult i32 %1, 8
br i1 %8, label %83, label %9

So if %1 is less than 8, it goes to 83, else to 9. Since 4 < 8, it goes to 83.

Label 83 is a phi node that seems to handle the case where the loop is not entered. It initializes some variables and then branches to label 88.

Label 88 is a loop that processes each element of the vector. It uses a getelementptr to access each element, adds 99 to it, checks if the result is less than 199, and if so, adds the original value to the sum.

Wait, let me see. The loop in label 88 increments the index each time. For each element, it does:

%92 = load i32, i32* %91, align 4, !tbaa !8
%93 = add i32 %92, 99
%94 = icmp ult i32 %93, 199
%95 = select i1 %94, i32 %92, i32 0
%96 = add nsw i32 %95, %90

So, for each element, it adds 99, checks if it's less than 199. If yes, it takes the original value (before adding 99), else 0. Then adds this to the running total.

So the function is summing all elements in the vector where (element +99) < 199, which simplifies to element < 100.

Wait, because (element +99) < 199 → element < 100. So any element less than 100 contributes its value to the sum; otherwise, it contributes 0.

Now, the vector in the assertion is {111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9}. Let's list each element and see if it's less than 100.

- 111: 111 >=100 → contributes 0
- 21: 21 <100 → contributes 21
- 3: 3 <100 → contributes 3
- 4000: 4000 >=100 → contributes 0
- 5: contributes 5
- 6: contributes 6
- 7: contributes 7
- 8: contributes 8
- 9: contributes 9

Adding these up: 21 +3 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9 = let's calculate:

21+3=24; 24+5=29; 29+6=35; 35+7=42; 42+8=50; 50+9=59.

Wait, that's 59. But the assertion expects 24. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount:

21 +3 =24; then 5+6=11, 7+8=15, 9=9. So 24 +11=35, +15=50, +9=59. Yes, 59.

But the assertion says the result should be 24. So why is that?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the condition. Let me check the code again.

The condition is `icmp ult i32 %93, 199`, which is checking if (element +99) is less than 199. So element +99 <199 → element <100. So elements less than 100 contribute their value.

Wait, but in the vector, the elements are 111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9.

So 21,3,5,6,7,8,9 are all less than 100. Their sum is 21+3+5+6+7+8+9= 21+3=24, 5+6=11, 7+8=15, 9=9. 24+11=35, +15=50, +9=59.

So the function should return 59, but the assertion expects 24. So the assertion would fail.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the code again.

Wait, in the code, the loop starts at label 88, and the index starts at 0. For each element, it's adding 99 and checking if it's less than 199. So yes, the condition is correct.

Wait, but the function is called with the vector and 4 as arguments. The second argument is 4, but in the code, the function uses it to determine how many elements to process? Or perhaps it's the number of elements to add.

Wait, looking back, the function's parameters are a vector and an integer. The code seems to process all elements of the vector, not just up to the given integer. Because in the loop, it's using %7, which is the zext of %1 (4) to i64. So the loop runs while the index is less than %7, which is 4.

Wait, no, looking at the loop condition in label 88:

%97 = add nuw nsw i64 %89, 1
%98 = icmp eq i64 %97, %7
br i1 %98, label %86, label %88

So %7 is the zext of %1 (4) to i64, which is 4. So the loop runs while %97 (which starts at 0 and increments each iteration) is not equal to 4. So it runs for 0,1,2,3 → 4 iterations.

So the function is processing the first 4 elements of the vector.

Ah, that's a crucial point I missed earlier. So the function is adding elements only for the first %1 elements, which is 4 in this case.

So the vector is {111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9}, and the function processes the first 4 elements: 111,21,3,4000.

Now, for each of these:

111: 111 +99 =210 → 210 >=199 → contributes 0
21: 21+99=120 <199 → contributes 21
3: 3+99=102 <199 → contributes 3
4000: 4000+99=4099 >=199 → contributes 0

So sum is 21+3=24. Which matches the assertion.

So the function returns 24, which is what the assertion expects. Therefore, the assertion passes.

Wait, but earlier I thought the loop was processing all elements, but no, it's processing the first %1 elements, which is 4. So only the first four elements are considered.

So the correct sum is 21+3=24. Therefore, the assertion passes.
</think>

The function processes the first four elements of the vector. Among these, 21 and 3 meet the condition, summing to 24. Thus, the assertion passes.

### final result

"assert (add_elements({1}, 1) == 1);",pass,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the assertion `assert (add_elements({1}, 1) == 1);` passes or fails based on the provided LLVM IR code. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the function `@_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi` which seems to be the `add_elements` function. The function takes a vector of integers and an integer, and returns an integer.

Looking at the IR code, the function starts by comparing the input integer `%1` with 0. If it's greater than 0, it proceeds; otherwise, it goes to label 86. Since in our case, the input is 1, which is greater than 0, we'll go into the loop.

Next, it gets the element pointer of the vector. The vector is initialized with `{1}`, so the pointer `%6` should point to the first element, which is 1.

Then, it checks if `%1` is less than 8. Since 1 is less than 8, it goes to label 83. Wait, no, looking again, the code after label 4 checks if `%1` is less than 8, and if so, it goes to label 83. Otherwise, it goes to label 9. So for `%1` =1, it goes to label 83.

Wait, no, let me recheck. The code after label 4 is:

%8 = icmp ult i32 %1, 8
br i1 %8, label %83, label %9

So if %1 is less than 8, go to 83, else to 9. Since 1 <8, it goes to 83.

Label 83 is a phi node, which suggests it's a loop or some kind of merge point. It initializes some variables and then proceeds to label 88.

In label 88, it's a loop that increments `%89` each time. It loads the element from the vector at position `%89`, adds 99 to it, checks if it's less than 199, and if so, adds it to the sum.

Wait, but the vector has only one element, so when `%89` is 0, it's accessing the first element (1), adds 99 to get 100, which is less than 199, so it adds 1 to the sum. Then `%97` increments to 1, and since it's equal to `%7` (which is 1), it breaks out of the loop.

So the sum would be 1, which is what the assertion expects. Therefore, the assertion should pass.

Wait, but let me make sure. The function is supposed to add elements, but in the code, it's adding 99 to each element and checking if it's less than 199. So for each element in the vector, if (element +99) <199, then it's counted. So for the vector {1}, 1+99=100 <199, so it's counted once. So the function returns 1, which matches the assertion.

So the assertion should pass.

The function `add_elements` processes each element in the vector, adding 99 and checking if the result is less than 199. For the input `{1}` and `1`, it correctly counts 1, so the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
