assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"To analyze the given assertion, let's break down the LLVM IR code for the `_Z8sum_to_ni` function, which corresponds to the `sum_to_n` function in the assertion statement.

### Step 1: Understand the Function Signature
The function `_Z8sum_to_ni` takes one `i32` (32-bit integer) argument `%0` and returns an `i32` value.

### Step 2: Analyze the Function Body
The function body consists of four instructions:

1. `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`: Adds 1 to the input `%0` and stores the result in `%2`. The `nsw` flag indicates that the addition is known to not overflow.
2. `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`: Multiplies the result `%2` with the original input `%0` and stores the result in `%3`. Again, the `nsw` flag indicates that the multiplication is known to not overflow.
3. `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`: Divides the result `%3` by 2 and stores the result in `%4`. This is a signed division.
4. `ret i32 %4`: Returns the result `%4` as the output of the function.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Assertion
The assertion statement is `assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);`. To evaluate this, we need to substitute the input `1` into the function and check if the output matches the expected value `1`.

### Step 4: Substitute Input and Evaluate
Substituting `1` into the function, we get:

1. `%2 = add nsw i32 1, 1` => `%2 = 2`
2. `%3 = mul nsw i32 2, 1` => `%3 = 2`
3. `%4 = sdiv i32 2, 2` => `%4 = 1`

The output of the function is indeed `1`, which matches the expected value in the assertion statement.

### Final Result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,pass,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the LLVM IR code provided for the `_Z8sum_to_ni` function. This function takes an integer `i32 %0` as input and returns an integer `i32`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`: This line adds 1 to the input integer `%0` and stores the result in `%2`. The `nsw` keyword indicates that the addition is performed with no signed wrap, meaning that the result will not wrap around if it exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an `i32`.

2. `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`: This line multiplies the result from step 1 (`%2`) with the original input integer `%0` and stores the result in `%3`. Again, the `nsw` keyword is used to indicate that the multiplication is performed with no signed wrap.

3. `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`: This line divides the result from step 2 (`%3`) by 2 and stores the result in `%4`. The `sdiv` keyword indicates that the division is performed as a signed division.

4. `ret i32 %4`: This line returns the result from step 3 (`%4`) as the output of the function.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

`assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);`

To evaluate this assertion, we need to execute the `_Z8sum_to_ni` function with the input `6` and check if the output is equal to `21`.

Here's the step-by-step execution of the function with input `6`:

1. `%2 = add nsw i32 6, 1` => `%2 = 7`

2. `%3 = mul nsw i32 7, 6` => `%3 = 42`

3. `%4 = sdiv i32 42, 2` => `%4 = 21`

4. `ret i32 21`

As we can see, the output of the function with input `6` is indeed `21`, which matches the expected value in the assertion statement.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,pass,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the LLVM IR code provided for the function `sum_to_n`. This function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`, which is a well-known formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works based on the LLVM IR code:

1. **%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1**: This line adds 1 to the input `n` (`%0`). The `nsw` keyword indicates that this operation does not wrap around in case of overflow, but since we're dealing with a small input (11), this is not a concern here. The result is stored in `%2`.

2. **%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0**: This line multiplies the result from step 1 (`%2`) by the original input `n` (`%0`). This effectively calculates `n * (n + 1)`. The result is stored in `%3`.

3. **%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2**: This line divides the result from step 2 (`%3`) by 2. This completes the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. The result is stored in `%4`.

4. **ret i32 %4**: This line returns the final result (`%4`) as the output of the function.

Given the input `11`, let's calculate the result manually:

1. `%2 = 11 + 1 = 12`
2. `%3 = 12 * 11 = 132`
3. `%4 = 132 / 2 = 66`

Therefore, `sum_to_n(11)` indeed equals `66`.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,pass,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the LLVM IR code provided for the `_Z8sum_to_ni` function, which corresponds to the `sum_to_n` function in the assertion. The function takes an integer `i32 %0` as input and returns an integer `i32`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`: This line adds 1 to the input integer `%0` and stores the result in `%2`. The `nsw` keyword indicates that the addition is performed with no signed wrap, meaning that the result will not wrap around if it exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an `i32`.

2. `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`: This line multiplies the result from step 1 (`%2`) with the original input integer `%0` and stores the result in `%3`. Again, the `nsw` keyword is used to prevent signed wrapping.

3. `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`: This line divides the result from step 2 (`%3`) by 2 and stores the result in `%4`. The `sdiv` keyword indicates that this is a signed division operation.

4. `ret i32 %4`: Finally, the function returns the result from step 3 (`%4`) as an `i32`.

Now, let's apply this function to the input value `30` from the assertion:

1. `%2 = add nsw i32 30, 1` => `%2 = 31`

2. `%3 = mul nsw i32 31, 30` => `%3 = 930`

3. `%4 = sdiv i32 930, 2` => `%4 = 465`

Therefore, the function `sum_to_n(30)` returns `465`, which matches the expected value in the assertion.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the LLVM IR code provided for the `_Z8sum_to_ni` function, which corresponds to the `sum_to_n` function in the assertion statement.

### Understanding the LLVM IR Code

The LLVM IR code defines a function `_Z8sum_to_ni` that takes an `i32` (32-bit integer) as input and returns an `i32` value. The function has several attributes, but the ones relevant to our analysis are `mustprogress`, `norecurse`, `nosync`, `nounwind`, `readnone`, and `uwtable`, which collectively imply that this function does not have side effects, does not recurse, and always progresses and returns.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:

1. `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`: Adds 1 to the input `%0` and stores the result in `%2`. The `nsw` flag means ""no signed wrap,"" indicating that the operation does not wrap around in case of overflow.

2. `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`: Multiplies the result from step 1 (`%2`) by the original input (`%0`) and stores the result in `%3`. Again, the `nsw` flag is used.

3. `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`: Divides the result from step 2 (`%3`) by 2 and stores the result in `%4`. This is a signed division.

4. `ret i32 %4`: Returns the result from step 3 as the output of the function.

### Analyzing the Assertion

The assertion statement is `assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);`. To verify this assertion, we need to calculate `sum_to_n(100)` using the steps outlined in the LLVM IR code and compare the result with `5050`.

1. `%2 = add nsw i32 100, 1` results in `%2 = 101`.
2. `%3 = mul nsw i32 101, 100` results in `%3 = 10100`.
3. `%4 = sdiv i32 10100, 2` results in `%4 = 5050`.

Therefore, `sum_to_n(100)` indeed equals `5050`, which matches the expected value in the assertion statement.

### Final Result

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
