"assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));",pass,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the behavior of the `rolling_max` function as represented in the provided LLVM IR code. The `rolling_max` function appears to take a vector (in this case, a `std::vector<int>`) as input and returns another vector.

The assertion in question is `assert(issame(rolling_max({}), {}));`. This assertion checks if the result of applying `rolling_max` to an empty vector is the same as an empty vector.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can evaluate this assertion based on the LLVM IR code:

1. **Understanding the Input**: The input to the `rolling_max` function is an empty vector. In the context of the LLVM IR, this means that the pointers representing the beginning and end of the vector's data will be the same or imply an empty range.

2. **Behavior of `rolling_max` on Empty Vector**: Looking at the LLVM IR, the function starts by checking if the input vector is empty (through a comparison of pointers in `%11 = icmp eq i32* %9, %10`). If the vector is empty, the function branches to label `%12`, which leads to the function returning without modifying the output vector. This implies that if the input vector is empty, the output vector will also be empty.

3. **Assertion Evaluation**: The `issame` function is not explicitly defined in the provided LLVM IR, but based on its usage in the assertion, it presumably checks for equality between two vectors. Given that `rolling_max` returns an empty vector when given an empty vector as input, the assertion `assert(issame(rolling_max({}), {}));` should hold true.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the `rolling_max` function's behavior on an empty vector, the assertion should pass.

"assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));",pass,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the behavior of the `rolling_max` function as represented by the provided LLVM IR code. The function appears to take a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector that represents the rolling maximum of the input vector.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the `rolling_max` function operates based on the LLVM IR code:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing the result vector with zeros and setting up pointers to the beginning and end of the input vector.

2. **Loop Setup**: It then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the input vector. The loop maintains several pointers and indices to keep track of the current maximum value and the position within the vectors.

3. **Maximum Value Update**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current element of the input vector is greater than the current maximum. If it is, the maximum value is updated.

4. **Result Vector Update**: The function then checks if the result vector needs to be reallocated to accommodate more elements. If reallocation is necessary, it calculates the new size, allocates memory, and copies the existing elements to the new memory location.

5. **Storing Maximum Value**: After ensuring there is enough space, it stores the current maximum value in the result vector.

6. **Loop Continuation**: The loop continues until all elements of the input vector have been processed.

7. **Cleanup and Return**: After the loop, the function performs any necessary cleanup (like deallocating memory if certain conditions are met) and returns the result vector.

Given this understanding of the `rolling_max` function, let's analyze the assertion:

```c
assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));
```

The `rolling_max` function applied to the input `{1, 2, 3, 4}` would indeed produce the output `{1, 2, 3, 4}` because each element is the maximum of all elements seen so far. The `issame` function presumably checks if two vectors are identical.

Therefore, the assertion should pass because the expected output matches the actual output of the `rolling_max` function for the given input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function operates based on the LLVM IR code:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing the result vector and setting up pointers for the input and output vectors.

2. **Loop Setup**: It then enters a loop that iterates over the elements of the input vector.

3. **Maximum Calculation**: Inside the loop, it calculates the maximum value seen so far by comparing the current element with the previously found maximum. If the current element is larger, it updates the maximum value.

4. **Memory Management**: The function also handles memory allocation and deallocation for the output vector as necessary, ensuring it has enough space to store the rolling maximum values.

5. **Result Update**: After calculating the maximum for the current position, it updates the result vector with this maximum value.

6. **Loop Continuation**: The loop continues until all elements in the input vector have been processed.

7. **Cleanup and Return**: After the loop, the function performs any necessary cleanup (like deallocating memory if required) and returns the result vector containing the rolling maximum values.

Given the assertion `assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));`, let's apply the logic of the `rolling_max` function:

- The input vector is `{4, 3, 2, 1}`.
- The expected output is `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

Applying the `rolling_max` logic:

1. The first element is `4`, which is the maximum so far, so the result vector starts with `{4}`.
2. The second element is `3`, which is less than `4`, so the maximum remains `4`, and the result vector becomes `{4, 4}`.
3. The third element is `2`, again less than `4`, so the result vector updates to `{4, 4, 4}`.
4. The fourth element is `1`, also less than `4`, leading to a final result vector of `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

This matches the expected output provided in the assertion.

"assert (issame(rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3}) ,{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}));",pass,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the functionality of the `rolling_max` function as represented in the provided LLVM IR code. The assertion checks if the result of `rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3})` is equal to `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`.

### Understanding the `rolling_max` Function

The `rolling_max` function appears to calculate the maximum value seen so far in a rolling window across the input vector. The LLVM IR code is complex, but we can infer its behavior from the context and known patterns of vector operations.

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing the result vector and setting up pointers for the input and output vectors.

2. **Looping Through the Input Vector**: It then enters a loop that iterates over each element in the input vector.

3. **Finding the Maximum**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current element is greater than the previously stored maximum. If it is, the function updates the maximum value.

4. **Storing the Maximum**: The maximum value seen up to each point is stored in the corresponding position in the output vector.

5. **Handling Vector Reallocation**: There are also parts of the code dedicated to handling vector reallocation when necessary, ensuring there is enough space to store the results.

### Evaluating the Assertion

Given the input `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}`, let's manually compute the expected output based on the described behavior:

1. The first element is `3`, so the maximum seen so far is `3`.
2. The second element is `2`, which is less than `3`, so the maximum remains `3`.
3. The third element is `3`, which is equal to the current maximum, so the maximum remains `3`.
4. The fourth element is `100`, which is greater than `3`, so the maximum becomes `100`.
5. The fifth element is `3`, which is less than `100`, so the maximum remains `100`.

Therefore, the expected output for the input `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}` is indeed `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`.

### Final Result

- **Assertion Result**: **pass**"
