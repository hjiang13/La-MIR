"assert (add_elements({1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99}, 3) == -4);",pass,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the LLVM IR code provided and how it implements the `add_elements` function. The function takes a vector of integers and an integer as arguments and returns an integer result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the `add_elements` function works based on the provided LLVM IR code:

1. **Initial Checks**: The function first checks if the second argument (`%1`) is greater than 0. If not, it jumps to the return statement and returns 0.

2. **Vector Preparation**: It then loads the vector's internal data pointer (`%6`) and calculates various indices and loop counts (`%7`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`) based on the second argument (`%1`).

3. **Loop Unrolling and Vector Operations**: The function enters a loop that processes the vector in chunks of 8 elements (due to loop unrolling). Inside the loop, it performs the following operations:
   - Loads two sets of 4 integers from the vector.
   - Adds 99 to each of these integers.
   - Checks if the results are less than 199. If so, it keeps the original value; otherwise, it uses 0.
   - Accumulates these values.

4. **Final Calculations**: After the loop, it performs additional calculations to handle any remaining elements that were not processed in the loop due to loop unrolling. It then sums up all the accumulated values.

5. **Return Statement**: Finally, the function returns the total sum.

Given the assertion `assert (add_elements({1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99}, 3) == -4);`, let's analyze what the function would do:

- The function will only consider the first 3 elements of the vector (`1`, `-2`, `-3`) because the second argument is `3`.
- It will add `99` to each of these elements, resulting in `100`, `97`, and `96`.
- Since all these results are less than `199`, it will sum up the original values (`1 + (-2) + (-3)`).
- The sum of these values is `-4`.

Therefore, the assertion is correct because `add_elements({1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99}, 3)` indeed returns `-4`.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (add_elements({111,121,3,4000,5,6}, 2) == 0);",pass,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the behavior of the `add_elements` function as defined in the provided LLVM IR code. The function takes a vector of integers and an integer as arguments. The LLVM IR code is quite complex due to its low-level nature, but we can deduce its functionality by examining key parts of the code.

The function appears to iterate over the elements of the vector, adds 99 to each element, and then checks if the result is less than 199. If it is, the original element is added to a running sum; otherwise, 0 is added. This process seems to be vectorized, meaning it operates on multiple elements simultaneously, which complicates the control flow but improves performance.

Given the assertion `assert (add_elements({111,121,3,4000,5,6}, 2) == 0);`, let's break down what should happen according to the function's logic:

1. The function will iterate over the first two elements of the vector (111 and 121) since the second argument is 2.
2. For each element, it will add 99 and check if the result is less than 199.
   - For 111, 111 + 99 = 210, which is not less than 199, so 0 is added to the sum.
   - For 121, 121 + 99 = 220, which is also not less than 199, so 0 is added to the sum again.

Based on this analysis, the function should return 0 because neither of the first two elements, when incremented by 99, results in a value less than 199, leading to 0 being summed in both cases.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (add_elements({11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 125);",fail,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the functionality of the `add_elements` function in the provided LLVM IR code. The function takes a vector of integers and an integer as arguments and returns an integer value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function's logic:

1.  The function first checks if the second argument (`%1`) is greater than 0. If not, it returns 0.
2.  It then loads the address of the first element of the vector (`%6`) and calculates the number of elements to process (`%7`).
3.  The function uses a loop to process the elements in chunks of 8 (or less for the remaining elements). Inside the loop, it performs the following operations:

    *   Loads 8 elements (or less) from the vector.
    *   Adds 99 to each element.
    *   Checks if the result is less than 199. If true, it keeps the original value; otherwise, it sets the value to 0.
    *   Accumulates the results.
4.  After the loop, the function reduces the accumulated values to a single integer using the `llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32` intrinsic.
5.  Finally, the function returns the reduced value.

Now, let's apply this logic to the given assertion:

```c
assert (add_elements({11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 125);
```

Here's how the function would process the input:

1.  The second argument (`4`) is greater than 0, so the function proceeds.
2.  It loads the address of the first element of the vector (`11`) and calculates the number of elements to process (`4`).
3.  The function processes the first 4 elements (`11`, `21`, `3`, `90`):

    *   Adds 99 to each element: `110`, `120`, `102`, `189`.
    *   Checks if the results are less than 199: `110`, `120`, `102`, `189` (all true).
    *   Accumulates the results: `110 + 120 + 102 + 189 = 521`.
4.  The function reduces the accumulated value to a single integer using the `llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32` intrinsic. However, since the accumulated value is already a single integer (`521`), the reduction operation doesn't change the value.
5.  The function returns the reduced value (`521`).

Comparing the returned value (`521`) with the expected value in the assertion (`125`), we can see that they don't match.

### final result

-   **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (add_elements({111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 24);",pass,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the behavior of the `add_elements` function as defined in the provided LLVM IR code. The function takes a vector of integers and an integer as arguments. It appears to perform some operations on the elements of the vector based on the second argument and returns an integer result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the `add_elements` function operates based on the LLVM IR code:

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the second argument (`%1`) is greater than 0. If not, it jumps to the return block (`label %86`) with a result of 0.

2. **Vector Operations**: If the second argument is greater than 0, it performs several vector operations. It loads elements from the vector, adds some values to them (specifically, 99), and then checks if the results are less than 199. If they are, it selects those elements; otherwise, it selects 0. These operations are done in a loop that iterates over the vector in steps of 16 (based on the vector width and the loop increment).

3. **Reduction and Return**: After the loop, it performs a vector reduction operation to sum up the selected elements and returns this sum.

Given the assertion statement `assert (add_elements({111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 24);`, let's analyze it:

- The second argument is 4, which means the function will operate on the first 4 elements of the vector `{111, 21, 3, 4000}`.
- For each of these elements, it adds 99 and checks if the result is less than 199. 
  - For 111, 111 + 99 = 210, which is not less than 199, so it selects 0.
  - For 21, 21 + 99 = 120, which is less than 199, so it selects 21.
  - For 3, 3 + 99 = 102, which is less than 199, so it selects 3.
  - For 4000, 4000 + 99 = 4099, which is not less than 199, so it selects 0.
- The sum of the selected elements is 21 + 3 = 24.

Based on this analysis, the assertion should pass because the function's return value matches the expected result of 24.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (add_elements({1}, 1) == 1);",fail,"To analyze the given assertion, we need to understand the behavior of the `add_elements` function as defined in the provided LLVM IR code.

The `add_elements` function takes two parameters: a vector of integers and an integer. The function appears to add 99 to each element of the vector that is less than 199, and then sums up the resulting values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function's behavior:

1. The function first checks if the second parameter (`%1`) is greater than 0. If not, it returns 0.
2. It then loads the vector's data and calculates the number of elements to process.
3. The function uses a loop to process the elements in chunks of 8 (or less, if there are fewer than 8 elements remaining). For each chunk, it:
	* Loads the elements into a vector register.
	* Adds 99 to each element.
	* Compares the resulting values to 199 and selects only those that are less than 199.
	* Accumulates the selected values in a running sum.
4. After processing all chunks, the function reduces the final sum to a single value using the `llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32` intrinsic.
5. If there are any remaining elements that were not processed in chunks (i.e., the vector length is not a multiple of 8), the function processes them individually and adds their contributions to the final sum.

Now, let's analyze the given assertion:

```c
assert (add_elements({1}, 1) == 1);
```

In this case, the input vector contains a single element with value 1, and the second parameter is 1.

Here's what happens when we call `add_elements` with these inputs:

1. The function checks that the second parameter (1) is greater than 0, so it proceeds.
2. It loads the vector's data, which consists of a single element with value 1.
3. Since there is only one element, the function processes it individually:
	* It adds 99 to the element, resulting in 100.
	* It compares 100 to 199 and selects the value since it's less than 199.
	* It accumulates the selected value (100) in the running sum.
4. The function reduces the final sum to a single value, which is simply 100.
5. Since there are no remaining elements, the function returns the final sum, which is 100.

However, the assertion expects the result to be 1, not 100. Therefore, the assertion will fail.

                - **assertion result**: **fail**"
