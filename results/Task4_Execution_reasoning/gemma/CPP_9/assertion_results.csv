"assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));",pass,"Let's analyze the LLVM IR code and the assertion statement.

**Understanding the Code**

The LLVM IR code defines a function called `rolling_max`. This function seems to be designed to calculate the rolling maximum of a vector of integers.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input:** The function takes a vector of integers (`std::vector<int>`) as input.

2. **Logic:** The code iterates through the input vector, comparing each element to the current maximum. If an element is greater than the current maximum, it becomes the new maximum.

3. **Output:** The function returns a new vector containing the rolling maximum values.

**Analyzing the Assertion**

The assertion statement `assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));` checks if calling `rolling_max` with an empty vector results in an empty vector.

**Reasoning**

The `rolling_max` function, when given an empty input vector, should logically return an empty vector as there are no elements to calculate the maximum from.

**Conclusion**

Based on the logic of the `rolling_max` function, the assertion `assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));` should **pass**.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));",pass,"Let's analyze the LLVM IR code and the assertion statement to determine if the assertion holds true.

**Understanding the Code**

The LLVM IR code defines a function called `rolling_max`. This function takes a vector of integers as input and appears to calculate the rolling maximum of the input vector. It iterates through the input vector, keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far and appending it to a new vector.

**Analyzing the Assertion**

The assertion statement checks if the output of `rolling_max` for the input vector `{1, 2, 3, 4}` is equal to the same vector `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

**Reasoning**

Since the input vector is already in ascending order, the rolling maximum at each position will be the element itself. Therefore, the `rolling_max` function should indeed return the same vector as the input.

**Conclusion**

Based on the logic of the `rolling_max` function and the nature of the input vector, the assertion should pass.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));",pass,"Let's analyze the LLVM IR code and the assertion statement.

**Understanding the Code**

The LLVM IR code defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector containing the rolling maximum of the input vector.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input:** The function takes a vector of integers (`std::vector<int>`) as input.

2. **Logic:** The function iterates through the input vector and maintains a current maximum value. For each element in the input vector, it compares the element with the current maximum and updates the maximum if the element is larger. The updated maximum is then added to the output vector.

3. **Output:** The function returns a new vector of integers containing the rolling maximum values.

**Analyzing the Assertion**

The assertion statement checks if the `rolling_max` function produces the expected output for a specific input.

- **Input:** The input vector is `{4, 3, 2, 1}`.
- **Expected Output:** The expected output vector is `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

**Reasoning**

The `rolling_max` function should return a vector where each element is the maximum value encountered so far in the input vector.

- For the input `{4, 3, 2, 1}`, the rolling maximums are:
    - First element: 4
    - Second element: 4 (maximum of 4 and 3)
    - Third element: 4 (maximum of 4, 3, and 2)
    - Fourth element: 4 (maximum of 4, 3, 2, and 1)

Therefore, the expected output `{4, 4, 4, 4}` is correct.

**Final Result**

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3}) ,{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}));",pass,"Let's analyze the provided LLVM IR code and the assertion statement.

**Understanding the Code**

The LLVM IR code defines a function called `rolling_max`. This function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector containing the rolling maximum values.

Here's a breakdown of the key parts:

* **Input:** The function takes a `std::vector<int>` as input, which we'll refer to as `input_vector`.
* **Output:** It returns a new `std::vector<int>`, which we'll call `output_vector`.
* **Logic:** The function iterates through the `input_vector`. For each element, it compares the element with the current maximum value seen so far. If the element is greater than the current maximum, it updates the maximum value. The current maximum value is then appended to the `output_vector`.

**Analyzing the Assertion**

The assertion statement checks if the output of `rolling_max` for a specific input matches the expected output.

* **Input:** `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}`
* **Expected Output:** `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`

**Reasoning**

Let's step through the input vector and see how the `rolling_max` function would process it:

1. **3:** The initial maximum is 3.
2. **2:** 2 is less than 3, so the maximum remains 3.
3. **3:** 3 is equal to the current maximum, so the maximum remains 3.
4. **100:** 100 is greater than 3, so the maximum is updated to 100.
5. **3:** 3 is less than 100, so the maximum remains 100.

Therefore, the expected output `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}` is indeed the correct rolling maximum for the given input.

### Final Result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
