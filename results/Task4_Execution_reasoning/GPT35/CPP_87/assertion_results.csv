assert (issame(get_row({,unknown,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `get_row` that takes a `std::vector` as input and returns another `std::vector`.
2. the function `get_row` performs various operations on the input vector to extract a row based on the provided index.
3. the function contains memory operations, comparisons, and branching logic to handle different cases.
4. the function also calls other functions like `llvm.memset`, `_znwm`, `_zst20__throw_length_errorpkc`, and `_zdlpv`.
5. the function has a complex control flow with multiple phi nodes and branching based on conditions.
6. the function ends with a return statement.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **n/a** (the assertion statement is incomplete and cannot be evaluated without the complete condition)"

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `get_row` that takes a `std::vector` as input and returns another `std::vector`.
2. the function contains complex memory operations and comparisons related to vectors and their elements.
3. the assertion statement seems incomplete and lacks the closing parenthesis and curly braces.

assert (issame(get_row({,unknown,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `get_row` that takes a `std::vector` as input and returns a modified `std::vector`.

"assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `get_row` that takes a vector as input and returns a modified vector.
2. the assertion statement calls the `get_row` function with an empty vector `{}` and the integer `1`.
3. the expected result of the assertion is to check if the output of `get_row({}, 1)` is equal to an empty vector `{}`.

"assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `get_row` that takes a vector of integers and an integer as input parameters.
2. the function `get_row` retrieves a row from the input vector based on the provided index.
3. the assertion statement calls the `get_row` function with a vector containing one element `{1}` and the index `2`.
4. since the index `2` is out of bounds for the input vector `{1}`, the expected result should be an empty vector `{}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) , {{2, 2}}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z7get_rowst6vectoris_iisaiieesais1_eei` that takes a vector of vectors and an index as input and returns a new vector based on the input index.
2. the assertion statement calls the `get_row` function with a vector of vectors `{{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}` and index `3`, expecting the result to be `{{2, 2}}`.
3. we need to analyze the llvm ir code to understand how the `get_row` function works and determine if the expected result matches the actual result.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
