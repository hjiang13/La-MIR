1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z15order_by_pointsst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a vector of integers and orders them based on their values.
2. the assertion statement is comparing the result of calling `order_by_points` on the input `{1, 11, -1, -11, -12}` with the expected output `{-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}`.
3. to analyze the assertion, we need to understand the logic of the `order_by_points` function based on the llvm ir code provided.

1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z15order_by_pointsst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a `std::vector` as input and returns a modified `std::vector`.
2. the assertion statement `assert (issame(order_by_points({}) , {}));` is checking if calling `order_by_points` with an empty `std::vector` returns an empty `std::vector`.
3. to analyze this assertion, we need to understand the implementation of the `order_by_points` function and how it handles empty vectors.
