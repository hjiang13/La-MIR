"assert (issame(count_up_to(5) , {2,3}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z11count_up_toi` which takes an integer input and returns a vector.
2. the function seems to perform some operations on the input integer and the vector.
3. the assertion statement is comparing the output of `count_up_to(5)` with the vector `{2, 3}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z11count_up_toi` that takes an integer argument and returns a `std::vector` object.
2. the function initializes the vector with a size of 2 if the input integer is greater than 2.
3. it then performs various operations like memory allocation, copying, and comparisons based on the input integer.
4. the function eventually returns without modifying the vector if the input integer is not greater than 2.
