assert (fibfib(2) == 1);,fail,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z6fibfibi` which seems to be a fibonacci function.
2. the function takes an integer argument `%0` and calculates the fibonacci number at that position.
3. the function initializes an array of size 100 to store intermediate fibonacci values.
4. the function then calculates the fibonacci number recursively and stores the intermediate values in the array.
5. finally, the function returns the fibonacci number at the given position.

assert (fibfib(1) == 0);,fail,"### thinking process
1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z6fibfibi` which seems to be a fibonacci function.
2. the function allocates an array of 100 integers and performs various operations on it to calculate fibonacci numbers.
3. the assertion statement `assert (fibfib(1) == 0);` is checking if the fibonacci number at index 1 is equal to 0.

assert (fibfib(10) == 81);,fail,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z6fibfibi` that seems to implement a fibonacci sequence calculation.
2. the function takes an integer parameter `%0` and calculates the fibonacci number at that position.
3. the function uses an array of size 100 to store intermediate fibonacci numbers.
4. the function has multiple basic blocks and uses phi nodes to handle different cases.
5. the function seems to have a loop structure for calculating fibonacci numbers.
6. the assertion statement is comparing the result of calling `fibfib(10)` with the expected value of `81`.
