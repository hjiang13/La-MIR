1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z19filter_by_substringst6vectorinst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeesais5_ees5_` that takes a vector of strings and a substring as input.
2. the function filters the input vector by checking if each string contains the given substring.
3. the function performs various operations like memory allocation, string comparison, and copying.
4. the provided assertion statement calls the function with an empty vector and the substring ""john"" and checks if the result is an empty vector.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"

1. the given llvm ir code defines a function `_z19filter_by_substring` that takes a vector of strings and a substring to filter by.
2. the function iterates over the input vector and filters out strings that contain the given substring.
3. the filtered strings are stored in a new vector that is returned as the output.
4. the assertion statement checks if the output of calling `filter_by_substring` with a specific input matches the expected output.

1. the given llvm ir code defines a function `_z19filter_by_substringst6vectorinst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeesais5_ees5_` that filters a vector of strings based on a substring.
2. the function takes a vector of strings and a substring as input and returns a new vector containing only the strings that contain the given substring.
3. the provided assertion statement calls the `filter_by_substring` function with a vector of strings {""grunt"", ""trumpet"", ""prune"", ""gruesome""} and the substring ""run"".
4. the expected result of the assertion is a new vector containing only the strings ""grunt"" and ""prune"" because they contain the substring ""run"".
