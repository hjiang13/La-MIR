1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z10prod_signsst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a vector of integers as input and performs certain operations on the elements of the vector.
2. the function calculates the product of signs of adjacent elements in the vector.
3. the function returns the final calculated value.

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z10prod_signsst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as input and performs some calculations on the elements of the vector.
2. the function seems to calculate the product of signs of consecutive elements in the vector.
3. the function uses llvm intrinsics like `llvm.abs.i32` and `llvm.umax.i64` for absolute value and maximum operations.
4. the assertion statement calls the function `prod_signs` with a vector `{1, 1, 1, 2, 3, -1, 1}` and expects the result to be `-10`.
