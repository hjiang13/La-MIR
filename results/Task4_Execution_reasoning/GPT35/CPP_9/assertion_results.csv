1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z11rolling_maxst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a `std::vector` as input and performs some operations on it.
2. the assertion statement is calling the `rolling_max` function with an empty vector and checking if the output matches an empty vector.
3. since the llvm ir code is quite complex and involves memory operations, it is difficult to directly determine the behavior of the `rolling_max` function without a detailed analysis of the code.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z11rolling_maxst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as input and returns another `std::vector<int>` as output.
2. the function seems to be performing some operations on the input vector to find the rolling maximum.
3. the llvm ir code contains memory operations, comparisons, and branching logic to handle different cases.
4. the function implementation is complex and involves memory allocation, copying, and comparison operations.

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z11rolling_maxst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as input and returns a modified `std::vector<int>` with rolling maximum values.
2. the function implementation involves memory operations, comparisons, and conditional branching.
3. the function seems to handle the calculation of rolling maximum values for the input vector.
4. the assertion statement calls the `rolling_max` function with input `{4, 3, 2, 1}` and checks if the output matches `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

2. the function seems to be calculating the rolling maximum of the input vector.
3. the assertion statement is comparing the result of calling `rolling_max` function with a specific input vector to an expected output vector.
