1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z11total_matchst6vectorinst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeesais5_ees7_` that takes two `std::vector<std::string>` arguments and returns a `std::vector<std::string>`.
2. the function performs various operations on the input vectors and returns a new vector.
3. the assertion statement `assert (issame(total_match({}, {}) , {}));` is checking if calling the `total_match` function with empty vectors returns an empty vector.
