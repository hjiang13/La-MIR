assert (fib4(5) == 4);,fail,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z4fib4i` which seems to be a fibonacci function.
2. the function takes an integer argument and calculates the fibonacci number at that position.
3. the function seems to be using a loop to calculate fibonacci numbers.
4. the assertion statement is checking if the fibonacci number at position 5 is equal to 4.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z4fib4i` which seems to be a fibonacci function.
2. the function takes an integer parameter and calculates the fibonacci number at that position.
3. the function uses a 100-element array to store intermediate results.
4. the function has multiple basic blocks and uses phi nodes for control flow.
5. the function seems to be calculating fibonacci numbers iteratively.

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z4fib4i` which seems to be a fibonacci function.
2. the function takes an integer argument `%0` and calculates the fibonacci number at that position.
3. the function uses a 100-element array to store intermediate fibonacci numbers.
4. the function has multiple basic blocks with phi nodes to handle different cases of fibonacci calculations.
5. the final result is stored in the array and returned.

assert (fib4(12) == 386);,fail,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z4fib4i` which seems to be a fibonacci function.
2. the function takes an integer input `%0` and calculates the fibonacci number at that position.
3. the function uses a fixed-size array of size 100 to store intermediate fibonacci values.
4. the function has multiple basic blocks with phi nodes to handle the fibonacci calculation.
5. the function returns the fibonacci number at the input position.
