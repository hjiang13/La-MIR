"assert (max_fill({{0,0,1,0}, {0,1,0,0}, {1,1,1,1}}, 1) == 6);",fail,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z8max_fillst6vectoris_iisaiieesais1_eei` that takes a vector as input and performs certain operations on it.
2. the function seems to involve vector operations and calculations based on the llvm ir code.
3. the assertion statement `assert (max_fill({{0,0,1,0}, {0,1,0,0}, {1,1,1,1}}, 1) == 6)` is comparing the result of calling `max_fill` function with a specific input to the expected output of 6.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z8max_fillst6vectoris_iisaiieesais1_eei` that takes a `std::vector` as input and performs some calculations.
2. the function seems to involve vector operations and loops to calculate the maximum fill value based on the input vector and a given integer.
3. the function uses llvm intrinsics like `llvm.umax.i64` and `llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32` for calculations.
4. the assertion statement is calling the `max_fill` function with a specific input vector `{{0,0,1,1}, {0,0,0,0}, {1,1,1,1}, {0,1,1,1}}` and an integer `2`, expecting the result to be `5`.
