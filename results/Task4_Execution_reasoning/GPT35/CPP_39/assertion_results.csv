assert (prime_fib(1) == 2);,fail,"### thinking process
1. the given llvm ir code defines a function `_z9prime_fibi` which seems to be a prime fibonacci number generator.
2. the function takes an integer input `%0` and returns an integer value.
3. the function contains a loop that calculates the prime fibonacci number based on the input.
4. the loop condition seems to be checking if the fibonacci number is less than the input `%0`.
5. the loop calculates the next fibonacci number and checks if it is a prime number.
6. the loop continues until the fibonacci number reaches the input value.
7. the function returns the last calculated fibonacci number.
