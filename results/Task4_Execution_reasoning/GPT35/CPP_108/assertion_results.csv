1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z10count_numsst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as input.
2. the function seems to iterate over the elements of the vector and performs some arithmetic operations.
3. the assertion statement is calling the function `count_nums` with a vector `{1, 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5}` and expects the result to be `6`.

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z10count_numsst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as input.
2. the function performs some arithmetic operations on the elements of the vector.
3. the assertion statement is comparing the result of calling the `count_nums` function with a vector `{1, 6, 9, -6, 0, 1, 5}` to the value `5`.
4. we need to analyze the llvm ir code to understand how the function `count_nums` processes the input vector and determine if the result matches the expected value of `5`.
