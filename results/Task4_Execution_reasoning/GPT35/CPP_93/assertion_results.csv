"assert (encode(""TEST"") == ""tgst"");",fail,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z6encodenst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceee` that takes a `std::__cxx11::basic_string` as input and encodes it.
2. the function seems to be encoding the input string by shifting the characters by 2 positions.
3. the assertion statement compares the result of encoding the string ""test"" with the expected encoded string ""tgst"".

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z6encodenst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceee` that takes a `std::__cxx11::basic_string` as input and performs some operations on it.
2. the function seems to encode the input string by shifting the characters based on their position in the alphabet.
3. the assertion statement is comparing the result of encoding the string ""mudasir"" using the function with the expected encoded string ""mwdcskr"".

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z6encodenst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceee` which seems to be encoding a string.
2. the function takes two parameters, one input string and one output string.
3. the function seems to be converting vowels to consonants based on the provided constant string `aeiouaeiou`.
4. the function then replaces the characters in the input string with the corresponding encoded characters.
5. the assertion statement is comparing the output of the `encode` function with the expected encoded string.

1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z6encodenst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceee` that takes a `std::__cxx11::basic_string` as input and encodes it.
2. the function seems to be encoding the input string based on some logic.
3. the assertion statement is comparing the encoded output of the input string ""i dont know what to write"" with the expected encoded string ""k dqnt knqw whct tq wrktg"".
4. we need to analyze the llvm ir code to understand how the encoding is done and verify if the encoded output matches the expected output.
