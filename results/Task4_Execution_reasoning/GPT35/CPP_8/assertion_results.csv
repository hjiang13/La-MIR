1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z11sum_productst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as input and performs some operations on it.
2. the assertion statement calls the `sum_product` function with an empty vector and checks if the result is equal to `{0, 1}`.

"assert (issame(sum_product({1, 1, 1}), {3, 1}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the given llvm ir code defines a function `_z11sum_productst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as input and performs some operations on it.
2. the function calculates the sum and product of elements in the input vector and returns a new `std::vector<int>` with the sum and product as elements.
3. the function involves vector operations and memory manipulation.

"assert (issame(sum_product({100, 0}),{100, 0}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z11sum_productst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a vector as input and performs some operations on it.
2. the assertion statement `assert (issame(sum_product({100, 0}),{100, 0}));` is checking if the result of calling `sum_product` function with input `{100, 0}` is equal to `{100, 0}`.
3. to analyze this assertion, we need to understand the logic implemented in the llvm ir code for the `sum_product` function.

1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z11sum_productst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as input and calculates the sum and product of the elements in the vector.
2. the function performs various arithmetic operations on the elements of the vector using llvm ir instructions.
3. the function then stores the calculated sum and product in a new `std::vector<int>` and returns it.

"assert (issame(sum_product({10}) ,{10, 10}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z11sum_productst6vectoriisaiiee` that takes a vector as input and performs some operations on it.
2. the assertion statement calls the `sum_product` function with a vector containing a single element `10` and checks if the result matches `{10, 10}`.
