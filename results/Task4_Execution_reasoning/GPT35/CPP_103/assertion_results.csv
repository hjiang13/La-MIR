1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z11rounded_avgb5cxx11ii` that takes two integers as input and returns a `std::__cxx11::basic_string` object.
2. the function calculates the average of the two input integers and rounds it to the nearest integer.
3. the rounded average is then converted to a string and returned.
4. the assertion statement is checking if calling `rounded_avg(1, 5)` returns the string ""11"".
