"assert (issame(tri(3) , {1, 3, 2, 8}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the given llvm ir code defines a function `_z3trii` which takes an integer and a vector as input.
2. the function performs various operations like memory allocation, comparison, branching, and element insertion based on the input integer.
3. the function seems to be manipulating the vector based on the input integer.
4. the function does not have any explicit return value, so it might be modifying the input vector in place.
