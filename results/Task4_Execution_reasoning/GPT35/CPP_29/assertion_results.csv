1. the provided llvm ir code defines a function `_z16filter_by_prefixst6vectorinst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeesais5_ees5_` that takes a vector of strings and a prefix string as input.
2. the function filters the vector by keeping only the strings that start with the given prefix.
3. the assertion statement calls the `filter_by_prefix` function with an empty vector and the prefix ""john"" and checks if the result is an empty vector.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

1. the given llvm ir code defines a function `_z16filter_by_prefixst6vectorinst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeesais5_ees5_` which takes a vector of strings and a prefix string as input and filters out the strings in the vector that start with the given prefix.
2. the function allocates memory for a new vector to store the filtered strings.
3. it then iterates over the input vector, checks if each string starts with the prefix, and copies the matching strings to the new vector.
4. the function also handles memory management for the created strings.
5. the given assertion statement tests the function by passing a vector of strings and a prefix, expecting the function to return a vector containing only the strings that start with the prefix.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
