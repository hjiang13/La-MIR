"assert (abs(triangle_area(3, 4, 5)-6.00)<0.01);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z13triangle_areafff` that calculates the area of a triangle given three sides.
2. the function uses floating-point arithmetic operations and a call to the `pow` function to calculate the area.
3. the assertion statement compares the absolute difference between the calculated area using the function `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` and the expected value `6.00` with a tolerance of `0.01`.
