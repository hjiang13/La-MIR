1. the llvm ir code defines a function `_z18fruit_distributionnst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeei` that takes a string and an integer as arguments.
2. the function seems to parse the string to extract numbers and then perform some calculations.
3. the provided assertion statement calls the `fruit_distribution` function with the string ""5 apples and 6 oranges"" and the integer 19, expecting the result to be 8.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"

1. the given llvm ir code defines a function `_z18fruit_distributionnst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeei` which takes a string and an integer as input.
2. the function seems to be manipulating strings and performing some calculations based on the input string.
3. the function contains a lot of memory allocation and manipulation operations using llvm ir instructions.
4. the function uses various other functions like `strtol`, `_znst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaicee9_m_createermm`, and `_znst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaicee14_m_replace_auxemmmc`.
5. the function calculates some values based on the input string and returns a result.

1. the llvm ir code provided defines a function `_z18fruit_distributionnst7__cxx1112basic_stringicst11char_traitsicesaiceeei` which takes a `basic_string` object and an integer as input.
2. the function seems to be manipulating the input string to extract information about fruit distribution.
3. the function then performs some calculations and returns a result.
