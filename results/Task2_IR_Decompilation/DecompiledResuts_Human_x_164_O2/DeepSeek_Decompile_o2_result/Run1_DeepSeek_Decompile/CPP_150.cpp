Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C or C++ that I can run. Let me start by understanding what the IR is doing.

Looking at the function _Z6x_or_yiii, which I think translates to x_or_y with three integer arguments. The function takes three i32 parameters: %0, %1, %2.

The first part checks if %0 is greater than 1. It then checks if %0 is less than 4. If it is, it goes to label 7, else to 12. Label 7 is a phi block, which suggests a loop or conditional merge. 

In block 7, it's using the phi values from %5 and %17. It then checks if %8 is 1, and based on that, selects between %2 and %1 to return.

Block 12 seems to handle cases where %0 is 4 or more. It uses phi again for %13 and %14. It calculates the remainder of %0 divided by %13, checks if it's zero, and then selects a value. It increments %13 and squares %18, checking if it's greater than %0. If so, it goes back to 7, else loops again.

Putting it together, I think the function is trying to find if %0 is a prime number. If yes, return %1, else return %2. The loop in block 12 increments %13 from 2 upwards, checking divisibility. If a divisor is found, it returns 0, which in block 7 would make it choose %2. If no divisors up to sqrt(%0) are found, it returns %1.

So, the C++ code would look like checking if %0 is prime. If it's 1 or less, return %2. For 2, return %1. For 3, return %1. For 4 and above, check for factors. If any found, return %2; else, return %1.

Wait, but in the IR, for numbers below 4, it's handled in block 7. So numbers 2 and 3 are primes, returning %1. Numbers 4 and above go into the loop.

I need to translate this logic into C++. The function x_or_y takes three ints: a, b, c. It returns b if a is prime, else c. So the code would be something like:

if (a <= 1) return c;
if (a is 2 or 3) return b;
then check divisors from 2 up to sqrt(a). If any divide a, return c; else return b.

So the C++ function should implement this logic.
</think>

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into a C++ function, we analyze the logic and translate it into a function that checks if a given number is prime and returns one of two values based on the result.

**Decompiled C++ Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int x_or_y(int a, int b, int c) {
    if (a <= 1) {
        return c;
    }
    if (a == 2 || a == 3) {
        return b;
    }
    if (a % 2 == 0 || a % 3 == 0) {
        return c;
    }

    int i = 5;
    int w = 2;
    while (i * i <= a) {
        if (a % i == 0) {
            return c;
        }
        i += w;
        w = 6 - w; // Alternate between 2 and 4 (5, 7, 11, 13, etc.)
    }

    return b;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    std::cout << x_or_y(7, 7, 0) << std::endl;  // Output: 7 (7 is prime)
    std::cout << x_or_y(8, 8, 0) << std::endl;  // Output: 0 (8 is not prime)
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `x_or_y` takes three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It returns `b` if `a` is a prime number and `c` if `a` is not prime.
- The code first handles edge cases for numbers less than or equal to 3.
- It then checks divisibility starting from 5, using a step to efficiently check potential factors.
- The `main` function demonstrates example usage of `x_or_y`.

This code can be compiled and run directly to test the functionality.
