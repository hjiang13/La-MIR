Alright, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me look at the provided IR code and see what it does.

First, I see that the module is named after a C++ file, so the original code is probably C++. The function defined here is `_Z3addii`, which looks like a C++ function name. Using a C++ name demangler, this should translate to `add(int, int)`. So, the function takes two integers and returns an integer.

Looking at the function body, there's an addition instruction: `%3 = add nsw i32 %1, %0`. This adds the two arguments and stores the result in `%3`. Then, `ret i32 %3` returns this result. So, the function is simply adding the two input integers.

I also notice the function attributes like `mustprogress`, `nofree`, etc., which suggest that the function is optimized and doesn't have any side effects. The target is x86-64 Linux, so the generated code should be compatible with that.

Putting this together, the C++ function should be straightforward. It should take two integers, add them, and return the sum. The function name after demangling is `add`, so the source code would have a function named `add` that does exactly that.

I'll write the C++ code accordingly, including the necessary includes and a `main` function to test it if needed. The function is self-contained, so it should compile and run without issues.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code back into C++ source code, we can analyze the IR and reconstruct the original function. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Function**: The IR defines a function `@_Z3addii` which, when demangled, corresponds to `add(int, int)` in C++.

2. **Analyze the Function Body**:
   - The function takes two `i32` (32-bit integer) arguments.
   - It performs an addition of the two arguments using `add nsw i32 %1, %0`, where `nsw` indicates "no signed wrap" (overflow is not wrapped).
   - The result is stored in `%3` and then returned.

3. **Reconstruct the C++ Function**: Based on the IR, the function adds two integers and returns their sum.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 10); // Example usage
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `add` function takes two integers `a` and `b`, adds them, and returns the result.
- The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `add` function by adding 5 and 10 and printing the result.

This code can be compiled and run directly to test the functionality.
