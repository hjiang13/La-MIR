Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the IR is doing.

Looking at the function `_Z3fibi(i32 %0)`, which seems to be a C++ function named `fib` taking an integer argument. The function starts by allocating an array of 1000 integers. It initializes the first two elements to 0 and 1, which suggests it's calculating Fibonacci numbers.

There are conditional checks based on the input value. If the input is less than 2, it returns 0 or 1 directly. For higher values, it enters loops to compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively, storing each result in the array.

The loops use several variables to track indices and values, updating the array elements as they go. After computing, the function loads the result from the array based on the input value and returns it.

I notice there's a lot of optimization in the IR, like loop unrolling and variable increments, which suggests the original code might have been optimized. However, to make it readable, I'll translate it into a straightforward iterative approach with necessary optimizations.

So, I'll write a C++ function that initializes an array, fills it with Fibonacci numbers up to the given index, and returns the appropriate value. I'll include the necessary headers and ensure the code is clean and readable.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code that corresponds to the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>

using namespace std;

int32_t fib(int32_t n) {
    int32_t fib_array[1000];
    fib_array[0] = 0;
    fib_array[1] = 1;

    if (n < 2) {
        return fib_array[n];
    }

    for (int32_t i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        fib_array[i] = fib_array[i-1] + fib_array[i-2];
    }

    return fib_array[n];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `fib` takes an integer `n` and returns an integer. It calculates the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach.

2. **Array Initialization**: An array `fib_array` of size 1000 is used to store Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number.

3. **Base Cases**: If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns `fib_array[n]` directly, as these are the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence.

4. **Iterative Calculation**: For values of `n` greater than 1, the function iterates from 2 to `n`, computing each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding numbers and storing it in the array.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the nth Fibonacci number from the array.

This code provides a clear and efficient way to compute Fibonacci numbers using an iterative approach, which is both time and space efficient compared to a naive recursive implementation.
