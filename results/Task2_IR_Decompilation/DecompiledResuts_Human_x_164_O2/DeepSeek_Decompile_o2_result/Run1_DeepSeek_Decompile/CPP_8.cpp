Okay, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++. Let me see what's going on here.

The function is called _Z11sum_productSt6vectorIiSaIiEE, which I think translates to sum_product(std::vector<int>). It takes two vectors, one as output and one as input.

Looking at the IR, it starts by getting the size and data pointers from the input vector. Then it calculates the difference between size and data, which might be the number of elements. If they're equal, it goes to label 91, which seems to handle the case where the vector is empty.

If not empty, it calculates the number of elements divided by 4, but at least 1. Then it checks if it's less than 8, but that part might not be executed. It looks like there's some loop unrolling or vectorization happening.

There are these phi nodes and loops, which probably handle processing the vector in chunks, maybe using SIMD instructions. The code is loading 4 elements at a time, performing some operations like addition and multiplication, and accumulating the results.

After processing all chunks, it calculates the sum and product. Then it constructs a new vector to return, initializing it with the sum and product.

Putting it all together, the function seems to compute the sum and product of all elements in the input vector and return a new vector containing these two values.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code, we analyze the operations and translate them back into C++ source code. The function appears to compute the sum and product of elements in a vector and return these results in a new vector.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> sum_product(const vector<int>& input) {
    int sum = 0;
    int product = 1;

    for (int num : input) {
        sum += num;
        product *= num;
    }

    return {sum, product};
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function `sum_product` takes a `const vector<int>&` as input.
- It initializes `sum` to 0 and `product` to 1.
- It iterates over each element in the input vector, updating `sum` and `product` accordingly.
- Finally, it returns a new vector containing the computed sum and product.

This code captures the essence of the operations performed in the provided LLVM IR.
