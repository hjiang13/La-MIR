Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code and I need to decompile it back to C++ source code. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with LLVM IR, but I'll give it a shot. Let me start by reading through the code carefully.

The function is named @_Z7any_intfff, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Maybe I can demangle it to understand what it's supposed to be. Using a demangler, it becomes "any_intfff", which probably stands for a function that checks if any of the three floats are integers. That makes sense because the function returns an i1, which is a boolean.

Looking at the code, the function takes three float arguments: %0, %1, %2. The first thing it does is call llvm.round.f32 on each of them. So for each float, it's rounding it and then comparing it to the original value using fcmp une, which checks if the rounded value is not equal to the original. If they're not equal, that means the original float wasn't an integer because rounding it changed its value.

So, for each float, it's checking if it's not an integer. Then it uses select instructions to see if any of them are non-integers. If any of the three floats isn't an integer, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

Wait, but looking more closely, the function has some additional logic. After checking the rounded values, there's a section where it adds pairs of floats and checks if the sum equals the third float. That part is a bit confusing. Maybe it's handling some edge cases where the sum of two floats equals another, which could indicate some relationship between them, but I'm not entirely sure how that ties into determining if any of them is an integer.

Let me try to map this out. The function first checks each float individually. If any of them isn't an integer, it returns true. If all three are integers, it then checks if the sum of any two equals the third. If that's the case, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

So putting it all together, the function returns true if any of the floats isn't an integer, or if the sum of any two equals the third. That makes sense as a way to check for certain properties of the floats.

Now, to translate this into C++. The function will take three floats as arguments and return a bool. For each float, I'll round it and check if it's different from the original. If any of them are different, return true. Then, if all are integers, check if any pair sums to the third and return true if so. Otherwise, return false.

I think that's the logic. Let me try writing that in C++. I'll use the std::round function for rounding and then perform the comparisons. After handling the rounding checks, I'll add the sum checks between each pair.

I need to make sure I handle all possible cases without missing any. Testing each condition step by step should cover everything the IR is doing. Once I've written the code, I'll review it to ensure it accurately reflects the IR's logic.

To decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the logic and translate it step by step. Here's the C++ code that corresponds to the provided IR:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

bool any_int(float a, float b, float c) {
    bool a_is_not_int = std::round(a) != a;
    bool b_is_not_int = std::round(b) != b;
    bool c_is_not_int = std::round(c) != c;

    if (a_is_not_int || b_is_not_int || c_is_not_int) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check if any two numbers sum to the third
    bool ab_eq_c = (a + b) == c;
    bool ac_eq_b = (a + c) == b;
    bool bc_eq_a = (b + c) == a;

    return ab_eq_c || ac_eq_b || bc_eq_a;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `any_int` takes three `float` arguments and returns a `bool`.
2. **Rounding Check**: For each input float (`a`, `b`, `c`), we round the value and compare it to the original. If any rounded value differs from the original, it indicates that the float is not an integer, and we return `true`.
3. **Sum Check**: If all floats are integers, we then check if the sum of any two floats equals the third. If any such condition is met, we return `true`.
4. **Return**: If none of the checks pass, the function returns `false`.

This C++ code accurately reflects the logic present in the provided LLVM IR.
