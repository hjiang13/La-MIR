Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C or C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code is doing.

Looking at the IR, the function is named @_Z8sum_to_ni and it takes an i32 parameter, which is an integer. The function has several attributes like mustprogress, nofree, etc., which probably indicate optimizations or constraints.

Inside the function, there are a few operations. First, %2 is calculated by adding 1 to %0, which is the input parameter. Then, %3 is the product of %2 and %0. Next, %4 divides %3 by 2 using signed division. Finally, the function returns %4.

So, putting this together, the function computes (n * (n + 1)) / 2, which is the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. 

To write this in C++, I'll define a function sum_to_n that takes an integer n and returns the sum. The expression is straightforward: return n * (n + 1) / 2;.

I should also consider any possible issues, like integer overflow, but since the problem doesn't specify handling that, I'll keep it simple. The function is concise and should work as intended.

To convert the provided LLVM IR code back into C++ source code, we analyze the operations performed in the function and translate them into equivalent C++ code.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The IR defines a function `@_Z8sum_to_ni` taking an `i32` (32-bit integer) parameter.
   - The C++ equivalent is a function `sum_to_n` that takes an `int` parameter `n`.

2. **Operations Inside the Function:**
   - **Addition:** `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1` corresponds to `n + 1`.
   - **Multiplication:** `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0` corresponds to `(n + 1) * n`.
   - **Division:** `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2` corresponds to `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`.
   - **Return:** `ret i32 %4` returns the computed sum.

3. **Translation:**
   - The operations compute the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - The function returns this sum.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
int sum_to_n(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```

You can save this to a `.cpp` file and compile it with a C++ compiler to use the function.
