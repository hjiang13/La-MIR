Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

Looking at the function definition, it's a function called _Z4fib4i, which I think is the mangled name for a function like fib(int). The function returns an i32 and takes an i32 argument.

The function starts by allocating space for 100 integers, which is probably a fixed-size array. It uses alloca, so it's on the stack. Then it stores some initial values, maybe the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence.

There's a conditional check comparing the input %0 with 4. If it's less than 4, it branches to label 34, which seems to handle the base cases by loading a value from the array and returning it.

If the input is 4 or more, it goes to label 6. Here, it increments the input, stores a 2 in the array at position 4, and checks if the new value is 5. If so, it goes to label 34; otherwise, it proceeds to label 10.

Label 10 seems to handle different cases based on whether the input is even or odd, determined by checking the least significant bit. If even, it goes to label 14; otherwise, it goes to label 17.

In label 17, there are phi nodes, indicating the start of a loop. It's calculating Fibonacci numbers iteratively, loading values from the array, adding them, and storing the result back.

Label 38 seems to be part of another loop, possibly handling a different part of the calculation, maybe for even indices. It also uses phi nodes and similar operations to update values in the array.

Looking at the store and load operations, the function is filling up the array with Fibonacci numbers up to the given index and then returning the nth Fibonacci number.

Putting it all together, the function initializes an array, fills it using iterative loops for both even and odd cases, and returns the appropriate value. The array is probably used to memoize the Fibonacci numbers for efficiency.

So, the C++ code should declare an array of 100 integers on the stack, initialize it with base values, and then fill it up using loops based on whether the input is even or odd. Finally, it returns the nth Fibonacci number from the array.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can observe that the function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with memoization.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>

using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    int fib_array[100]{};
    fib_array[0] = 0;
    fib_array[1] = 0;
    fib_array[2] = 2;

    if (n < 4)
        return fib_array[n];

    fib_array[4] = 2;
    if (n == 5)
        return 2;

    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        for (int i = 6; i <= n; i += 2) {
            fib_array[i] = fib_array[i - 2] + fib_array[i - 4] + fib_array[i - 1];
        }
    } else {
        for (int i = 7; i <= n; i += 2) {
            fib_array[i] = fib_array[i - 2] + fib_array[i - 4] + fib_array[i - 1];
        }
    }

    return fib_array[n];
}
```

This code initializes an array to store Fibonacci values, handles base cases, and iteratively computes the Fibonacci number based on whether the input is even or odd.
