Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR is doing.

Looking at the IR, the function is called _Z10choose_numii, which seems to be a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find it translates to "choose_num(int, int)". So the function takes two integers and returns an integer.

The IR starts with an icmp instruction comparing %1 and %0. If %1 is less than %0, it branches to label 12, otherwise proceeds to label 4.

At label 4, it checks if %1 equals %0. If so, it computes the remainder of %1 divided by 2. Then it checks if this remainder is 1. If both conditions are true (%1 equals %0 and the remainder is 1), it branches to label 12. Otherwise, it goes to label 9.

At label 9, it sign-extends the result of the remainder check (which is a boolean) to an i32, adds it to %1, and then branches to label 12.

The phi node at label 12 combines the possible values. If coming from label 2 or 4, it returns -1. If from label 9, it returns the result of the add instruction.

Putting this together, the function seems to return -1 if %1 is less than %0, or if %1 equals %0 but is even. Otherwise, it returns %1 plus whether it's odd (which would be 1 if odd, 0 if even).

So in C++, the function would check if a is less than b, return -1. If a equals b, check if it's odd. If so, return a + 1, else -1. Otherwise, return b + (b mod 2).

Wait, but looking back, when a equals b, the function returns a + 1 only if a is odd. Otherwise, it returns -1.

So the function can be written as:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) return -1;
    if (b == a) {
        if (b % 2 == 1) return b + 1;
        else return -1;
    }
    return b + (b % 2);
}

Wait, but in the IR, when b is greater than a, it doesn't check for equality again. So perhaps the initial condition is if b is not less than a, and not equal, then proceed to the else case.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is:

if (b < a) return -1;
else if (b == a) {
    if (b is odd) return b + 1;
    else return -1;
}
else {
    if (b is odd) return b + 1;
    else return b;
}

Wait, no, looking at the IR again, when b > a, it doesn't go into the equality check. So perhaps the function is:

if (b < a) return -1;
if (b == a) {
    if (b is odd) return b + 1;
    else return -1;
}
else {
    if (b is odd) return b + 1;
    else return b;
}

But wait, in the else case (b > a), the function returns b + (b mod 2). Since b mod 2 is 1 if odd, 0 if even. So it's effectively adding 1 if odd, else 0. So it's returning b if even, b +1 if odd.

But in the case where b equals a, it only adds 1 if odd, else returns -1.

So the function can be written as:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a)
        return -1;
    else if (b == a) {
        if (b % 2 == 1)
            return b + 1;
        else
            return -1;
    } else {
        if (b % 2 == 1)
            return b + 1;
        else
            return b;
    }
}

Alternatively, it can be simplified.

But perhaps the initial translation is accurate.

To decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we need to understand the logic and structure of the IR. The function `_Z10choose_numii` is a mangled C++ function name, which translates to `choose_num(int, int)`. 

Here is the C++ source code that corresponds to the provided IR:

```cpp
int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a)
        return -1;
    if (b == a) {
        if (b % 2 == 1)
            return b + 1;
        else
            return -1;
    } else {
        if (b % 2 == 1)
            return b + 1;
        else
            return b;
    }
}
```

This function follows the logic outlined in the IR:
1. If `b` is less than `a`, it returns `-1`.
2. If `b` is equal to `a`, it checks if `b` is odd. If so, it returns `b + 1`; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
3. If `b` is greater than `a`, it checks if `b` is odd. If so, it returns `b + 1`; otherwise, it returns `b`.

You can save this code in a `.cpp` file and compile it with a C++ compiler to run it directly.
