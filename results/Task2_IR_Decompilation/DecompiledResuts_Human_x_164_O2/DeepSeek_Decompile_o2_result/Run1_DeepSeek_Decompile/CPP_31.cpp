Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot. Let me start by looking at the IR code provided.

The function is called `_Z8is_primex(i64 %0)`, which I think in C++ would be `bool is_prime(long long x)`. That makes sense because it's checking if a number is prime.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by comparing the input `x` with 2. If `x` is less than 2, it returns false. That's straightforward because primes are greater than 1.

Next, it checks if `x` is less than 4. If so, it returns true. Wait, that can't be right because 2 and 3 are primes, but what about 1? Oh, no, because the first check already handles numbers less than 2, which includes 1. So numbers 2 and 3 would pass the second check and return true, which is correct.

Now, the loop part is a bit tricky. It initializes a variable `i` to 2. Then in the loop, it computes `x % i`. If the remainder is 0, it's not a prime. If not, it increments `i` by 1 and loops again. But the loop doesn't just increment `i` by 1 each time; it seems to have some optimization.

Wait, the loop uses `phi` to get the next value of `i`. The phi node combines two possibilities: the previous `i` incremented by 1, and starting from 2. So the loop increments `i` by 1 each time. That makes sense because you're checking each number up to the square root of `x`.

The condition in the loop checks if `i` squared is greater than `x`. If it is, then `x` is a prime. Otherwise, it continues the loop. So the loop runs while `i` squared is less than or equal to `x`.

Putting it all together, the function:

1. Returns false if `x` is less than 2.
2. Returns true if `x` is 2 or 3.
3. Checks divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root of `x`.
4. If any `i` divides `x`, it's not prime; otherwise, it is.

So translating this into C++, the function should handle these cases. I think the decompiled code should look something like the response I wrote earlier. I just need to make sure all the conditions are correctly placed and the loop is properly structured.

The provided LLVM IR code defines a function `is_prime` that checks whether a given number is prime. Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_prime(long long x) {
    if (x < 2)
        return false;
    if (x < 4)
        return true;
    
    long long i = 2;
    while true {
        long long rem = x % i;
        if (rem == 0)
            return false;
        long long i_squared = (i + 1) * (i + 1);
        if (i_squared > x)
            return true;
        i++;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << is_prime(2) << std::endl;  // true
    std::cout << is_prime(3) << std::endl;  // true
    std::cout << is_prime(4) << std::endl;  // false
    std::cout << is_prime(5) << std::endl;  // true
    std::cout << is_prime(6) << std::endl;  // false
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code defines a function `is_prime` that checks for primality by testing divisibility up to the square root of the input number. The `main` function provides example usage.
