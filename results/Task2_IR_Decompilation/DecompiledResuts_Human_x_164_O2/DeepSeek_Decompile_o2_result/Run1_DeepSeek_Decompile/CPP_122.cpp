<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on LLVM IR, but I'll give it a shot. Let me look at the code provided and see what I can make of it.

First, the code defines a function called @Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi, which I think is a C++ mangled name. I remember that in C++, when you have function names that are mangled, they can be demangled to get the original function name. Let me try to demangle that.

The function starts with "_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi". Using a demangler, I think this translates to "add_elements(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int>>)" with an int return type. So the function is probably something like int add_elements(std::vector<int> &vec, int n). That makes sense because the parameters are a vector and an integer.

Looking at the function, it begins by checking if the integer %1 (which is the second parameter, let's say n) is greater than 0. If not, it branches to label 86, which seems to be the exit point, returning 0. So the function returns 0 when n is not positive.

Next, there's a bunch of setup where it gets the element pointer of the vector. The vector's data is accessed through a series of getelementptr instructions, loading the pointer to the data. So %6 is the pointer to the vector's data.

Then, there's a check if n is less than 8. If so, it goes to label 83, which seems to be the scalar part of the loop, handling the remaining elements that don't fill a full SIMD vector. Otherwise, it proceeds to handle the main loop.

The main loop seems to be vectorized, using 4-wide SIMD vectors (<4 x i32>). It's loading elements from the vector's data, adding 99 to them in chunks of 4 using SIMD instructions. It checks if the result is less than 199. If so, it keeps the original value; otherwise, it zeros it out. This is done in two parts, probably handling different parts of the 4-wide vectors.

There's a phi node at label 55 that accumulates the results from both the main loop and the scalar loop. After processing all elements, it uses llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32 to sum up the 4-wide vector into a single integer, which is then added to the total sum.

The scalar loop at label 88 increments each element one by one, adding 99 and checking if it's less than 199, similar to the vector part.

Putting this all together, the function seems to iterate over the elements of the vector, add 99 to each element if it's less than 100 (since adding 99 would make it 199 or less), and return the sum of all such elements.

So, the C++ code should create a vector, iterate through each element, add 99 if the element is less than 100, accumulate the sum of these elements, and return the sum. The vector is passed by reference, but in the IR, it's read-only, so in C++ it should be a const reference.

Wait, but the function is modifying the vector elements. Oh, because in the IR, it's loading and storing back the modified values. So in C++, the vector should be passed as a non-const reference.

But looking back, the function's parameter is a const pointer? Wait, no, in the IR, the vector is loaded as read-only, but in the code, it's actually being modified. Hmm, maybe I need to check that again.

Wait, the function is declared as:

define dso_local i32 @_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi(%"class.std::vector"* nocapture readonly %0, i32 %1)

So the vector is read-only. But in the code, it's modifying the elements. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the function is supposed to be modifying the vector, so perhaps the IR is incorrect, or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

But in the code, the IR is loading the data, modifying it, and storing it back. So in the C++ code, the vector should be passed by non-const reference. So perhaps the function signature should be int add_elements(std::vector<int>& vec, int n), not const.

But the IR has the vector as readonly, which might mean that the function doesn't modify it. That's confusing. Maybe the function is supposed to read the elements, add 99 to them, but not modify the original vector? Or perhaps it's a bug, and the vector should be modifiable.

Wait, looking at the IR, it's storing the modified values back into the vector's data. So in C++, the vector must be passed as a non-const reference. So the function should take a std::vector<int>& as the first parameter.

So putting it all together, the C++ code would look something like this:

#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int add_elements(vector<int>& vec, int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (vec[i] < 100) {
            vec[i] += 99;
            sum += vec[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

Wait, but in the IR, the condition is checking if (vec[i] + 99) < 199, which simplifies to vec[i] < 100. So yes, that's correct.

But in the code, the vector is accessed directly via pointers, and the loop is unrolled and vectorized. So the C++ code I wrote is the scalar version, but the IR is optimized with SIMD. However, the decompiled code doesn't need to include SIMD; the compiler will handle that.

So the final C++ code should be as I wrote, with the function taking a non-const reference to the vector and an integer n. It iterates through the first n elements, adds 99 to those less than 100, and sums them up.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we first analyze the function's structure and operations. The function `add_elements` takes a `std::vector<int>` and an integer `n`, iterates through the vector's elements, and modifies them based on certain conditions. The IR indicates the use of SIMD optimizations for performance, but the decompiled C++ code can be written in a straightforward manner without explicit SIMD instructions, allowing the compiler to handle optimizations.

Here's the decompiled C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int add_elements(vector<int>& vec, int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (vec[i] < 100) {
            vec[i] += 99;
            sum += vec[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This code defines a function `add_elements` that accepts a reference to a `vector<int>` and an integer `n`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the vector, adding 99 to each element if it is less than 100, and accumulates the sum of these modified elements. The function then returns the total sum.

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Parameters**: The function takes a `vector<int>` by reference and an integer `n` indicating the number of elements to process.
2. **Loop Through Elements**: A `for` loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, checking each element.
3. **Condition Check**: If an element is less than 100, it is incremented by 99.
4. **Sum Accumulation**: The modified value (after adding 99) is added to the sum.
5. **Return Sum**: The accumulated sum is returned as the result.

This C++ code captures the essence of the operations performed in the provided LLVM IR, abstracting away the low-level optimizations into a clear, readable function.
