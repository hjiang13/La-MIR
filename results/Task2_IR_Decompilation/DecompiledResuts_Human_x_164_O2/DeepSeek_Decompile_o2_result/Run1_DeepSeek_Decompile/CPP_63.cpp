Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code that I need to decompile into C++ source code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the function signature. The function is named @_Z6fibfibi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, that should translate to something like "fib(int)". So the function takes an integer and returns an integer.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by allocating a block of memory for 100 integers. That's the %2 = alloca [100 x i32] line. Then it bitcasts this to an i8* and calls llvm.lifetime.start to manage the memory lifetime. So in C++, this would probably be a local array or a dynamically allocated array.

Next, there are some initial stores. It's storing 0, 0, and 1 into the first few elements of the array. So that's like initializing the first three elements for a Fibonacci sequence, I suppose. Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1) = 0, Fib(2) = 1.

Then there's an ICMP instruction checking if the input %0 is less than 3. So if the input is less than 3, it branches to label 31, otherwise it goes to label 8. So for n < 3, it just returns the stored value.

Label 8 starts the main logic. It increments the input by 1, checks if it's equal to 4, and branches accordingly. There's a loop involved here, as indicated by the !llvm.loop hint.

Looking deeper, there are two main loops it seems. One starting at label 13 and another at label 35. The first loop seems to handle even indices, and the second loop handles odd indices, maybe? Or perhaps they're handling different parts of the Fibonacci calculation.

In label 13, it checks if the loop variable is even or odd using %14 = and i64 %10, 1. Then it either branches to label 19 or 16. Label 16 seems to adjust the indices for the next iteration, maybe for odd numbers.

Label 19 is where the main Fibonacci calculation happens. It loads values from the array, adds them, and stores the result. So for each step, it's computing Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2), which makes sense for Fibonacci.

Then, in label 35, it's doing similar operations but perhaps for the other part of the index. It's updating the indices and storing the new values. This might be handling the next set of even or odd indices.

Finally, after all the loops, it loads the value from the array based on the original input and returns it.

Putting this all together, the function is preallocating an array to store Fibonacci numbers up to the 100th element. It initializes the first few, then uses a loop to compute each subsequent number by summing the previous two. Depending on whether the current index is even or odd, it uses different parts of the loop to handle the calculations, possibly for optimization.

In C++, this would translate to a function that initializes an array, fills it iteratively, and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The use of an array suggests that it's using dynamic programming to store intermediate results, which is efficient for multiple calls but might be overkill if only a single value is needed. However, given the IR, this seems to be the approach taken.

I also notice that the function uses some bitwise operations and loop optimizations, possibly to handle even and odd indices differently, which might be a way to optimize the loop by reducing the number of iterations or improving cache utilization.

So, the final C++ code should have a function that initializes an array of 100 integers, sets the base cases, then fills the rest using a loop, and returns the appropriate value based on the input.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we'll follow the logic and structure observed in the IR. The function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with an array to store intermediate values.

Here is the C++ source code corresponding to the given IR:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fib(int n) {
    int fib_array[100];
    
    fib_array[0] = 0;
    fib_array[1] = 0;
    fib_array[2] = 1;
    
    if (n < 3) {
        return fib_array[n];
    }
    
    fib_array[3] = 1;
    
    for (int i = 4; i <= n; ++i) {
        fib_array[i] = fib_array[i-1] + fib_array[i-2];
    }
    
    return fib_array[n];
}

int main() {
    int result = fib(10); // Example usage
    std::cout << "Fibonacci number: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `fib` takes an integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

2. **Array Initialization**: An array `fib_array` of size 100 is allocated to store Fibonacci numbers up to the 100th element.

3. **Base Cases**: The first three elements are initialized to handle cases where `n` is 0, 1, or 2.

4. **Early Return**: If `n` is less than 3, the function returns the corresponding pre-stored value directly.

5. **Iterative Calculation**: For `n` greater than or equal to 3, the function iterates from 4 to `n`, computing each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding ones and storing it in the array.

6. **Return Result**: The function returns the nth Fibonacci number from the array.

7. **Main Function**: An example `main` function demonstrates how to use `fib` and print the result.

This code efficiently computes the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming to store intermediate results, optimizing both time and space complexity.
