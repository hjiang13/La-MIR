Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code, and I need to decompile it back into C or C++ code. Let's see what I can do. I'm not super familiar with LLVM IR, but I know it's a low-level representation, kind of like assembly but for the compiler. 

Looking at the code, I see a function definition: define dso_local zeroext i1 @_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni(i32 %0). The name seems mangled, probably because it's C++. The function returns an i1, which is a boolean, and takes an i32, which is a 32-bit integer. 

The function starts with %2 = and i32 %0, 1. That looks like it's taking the input and doing a bitwise AND with 1. So it's checking the least significant bit. If the result is 0, that means the number is even. 

Then %3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0. That's checking if the result of the AND is equal to zero, which would mean the original number is even. So %3 is true if the number is even, false otherwise.

Next, %4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7. That's checking if the input is greater than 7. So %4 is true if the number is 8 or higher.

Finally, %5 = and i1 %4, %3. This is a logical AND between %4 and %3. So %5 is true only if both conditions are met: the number is even and greater than 7.

The function returns %5, which is the result of that AND operation.

Putting this together, the function returns true if the input is an even number greater than 7. So in C++, this would be a function that takes an integer and returns a bool. 

The mangled name @_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni suggests that the original function was named is_equal_to_sum_even, and it's taking an integer as an argument. 

So the C++ code would look something like:

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int a) {
    return (a > 7) && (a % 2 == 0);
}

I think that's it. Let me double-check. The IR does the bitwise AND with 1 and checks if it's zero, which is the same as checking if the number is even. Then it checks if it's greater than 7, and returns true only if both are true. Yep, that makes sense.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Function Signature**: The IR defines a function `@_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni` that takes an `i32` (32-bit integer) and returns an `i1` (boolean).

2. **Understand the Operations**:
   - **Bitwise AND**: `%2 = and i32 %0, 1` checks if the least significant bit is 0, determining if the number is even.
   - **Equality Check**: `%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0` verifies if the result is zero (even).
   - **Greater Than Check**: `%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7` checks if the number is greater than 7.
   - **Logical AND**: `%5 = and i1 %4, %3` combines both conditions.

3. **Construct the C++ Function**: The function returns `true` if the input is even and greater than 7.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int a) {
    return (a > 7) && (a % 2 == 0);
}
```

**Answer:**

The decompiled C++ function is:

```cpp
bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int a) {
    return (a > 7) && (a % 2 == 0);
}
```
