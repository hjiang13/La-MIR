Alright, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++. Let me start by looking through the provided code to understand what it's doing.

The function is named `_Z6x_or_yiii`, which suggests it's a C++ function because of the name mangling. If I demangle it, it probably becomes something like `x_or_y(int, int, int)`.

Looking at the parameters, it takes three `i32` arguments, which are 32-bit integers. The function returns an `i32` as well.

The function starts with two comparisons: `icmp sgt i32 %0, 1` which checks if the first argument is greater than 1, and `icmp slt i32 %0, 4` to see if it's less than 4. Based on this, it branches to label 7 or 12.

In label 7, there's a phi node for `%8` which suggests some loop or conditional logic. It uses `zext` to zero-extend a boolean to a byte. There's an AND operation and a comparison to check if the result is zero, leading to a select instruction that chooses between `%2` and `%1` based on the comparison.

Label 12 seems more complex. There's another phi node for `%13` and `%14`. It computes the remainder of `%0` divided by `%13`, checks if it's zero, and then selects between 0 and `%14`. It increments `%13` and computes its square, then checks if the square exceeds `%0`. Depending on that, it branches back to label 7 or continues looping.

Putting this together, it looks like the function is checking if the first argument (`%0`) is greater than 1 and less than 4. If so, it does something, else it proceeds to a loop where it's checking divisibility and maybe counting or checking conditions until a certain point.

I think the function is implementing a loop that checks for some condition related to the first argument, possibly similar to a factorial or iterative calculation, and returns either the second or third argument based on certain checks.

To write the C++ code, I'll start by setting up the function with the correct parameters. Then, I'll translate the logical flow: first checking if `x` is between 1 and 4, and if not, entering a loop that increments a counter, checks remainders, and updates based on some condition until the square of the counter exceeds `x`.

I'll need to handle the select instructions by using conditional operators in C++. The loop will continue until the square of `i` is greater than `x`, and in each iteration, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`, updating a flag accordingly.

Finally, after the loop, the function returns `y` if the flag is zero, otherwise `z`. This seems to align with the logic in the IR, where the return value is selected based on the conditions checked during the loop.

Here is the C++ source code that corresponds to the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int x_or_y(int x, int y, int z) {
    if (x > 1 && x < 4) {
        return (y & 1) ? y : z;
    } else {
        int i = 2;
        char flag = 0;
        while (true) {
            if (x % i == 0) {
                flag = 0;
            } else {
                flag = 1;
            }
            i++;
            if (i * i > x) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return (flag == 0) ? z : y;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << x_or_y(5, 10, 20) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `x_or_y` takes three integers as parameters and returns an integer.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - If `x` is greater than 1 and less than 4, the function performs a bitwise AND on `y` with 1.
   - If the result is non-zero, it returns `y`; otherwise, it returns `z`.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - For other values of `x`, the function enters a loop starting with `i = 2`.
   - It checks if `x` is divisible by `i`. If it is, `flag` is set to 0; otherwise, `flag` is set to 1.
   - The loop continues until `i * i` exceeds `x`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - After exiting the loop, if `flag` is 0, the function returns `z`; otherwise, it returns `y`.

This C++ code captures the logic present in the provided LLVM IR, handling both the initial condition and the loop structure appropriately.
