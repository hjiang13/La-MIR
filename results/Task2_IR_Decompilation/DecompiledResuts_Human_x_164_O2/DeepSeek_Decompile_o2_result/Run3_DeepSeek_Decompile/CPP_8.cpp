Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing. The function in question is `_Z11sum_productSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which I recognize as a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find that it translates to `sum_product(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int>>)`. So, this function takes a vector and returns another vector.

Looking at the IR code, the function has two parameters: one is the output vector `%0`, and the other is the input vector `%1`. The function starts by getting the size and data pointers from the input vector. It calculates the size by subtracting the data pointer from the end pointer, which gives the number of elements. 

Next, there's a check if the size is zero. If it is, the function skips to label 91, which seems to handle the case where the output vector is initialized with default values, setting the product sum to zero. 

If the size isn't zero, the code calculates the loop count by dividing the size by 4, ensuring it's at least 1. It then checks if this loop count is less than 8. If it is, it proceeds to a loop that processes elements in blocks of 4 using SIMD instructions. Otherwise, it uses a different approach, possibly for larger sizes.

In the SIMD loop, it loads four elements at a time, performs multiplication and addition operations, and accumulates the results. After processing all possible blocks of 4, it handles any remaining elements that don't fit into a block of 4 using scalar operations.

Once all elements are processed, the function calculates the final sum and product. It then initializes the output vector with these values.

The IR code uses several LLVM intrinsics for vector operations, like `llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32` and `llvm.vector.reduce.mul.v4i32`, which reduce a vector to a scalar by summing or multiplying all elements, respectively.

Putting this all together, the C++ function takes a vector of integers, computes the sum of all elements, the product of the first four elements, and returns a new vector containing these two values. If the input vector is empty, it returns a vector with zeros.

I need to make sure I handle the vector initialization correctly, especially in the case where the input is empty. Also, I should ensure that the scalar loop correctly processes any leftover elements after the SIMD processing. The use of `noxop` and `nounroll` attributes in the loops might be important for optimization, so I'll keep those in mind, though in C++ they translate to compiler directives or pragmas.

Finally, I'll structure the code to first handle the empty case, then process in SIMD for efficiency, and fall back to scalar for leftovers. The result is a vector with the sum as the first element and the product as the second.

The provided LLVM IR code appears to be a function called `sum_product` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as input and returns another `std::vector<int>`. The function computes some product and sum of the vector elements, likely returning these values in the resulting vector.

Here is the decompiled C++ code that matches the provided IR:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> sum_product(const vector<int>& input) {
    vector<int> result;
    
    if (input.empty()) {
        result.resize(2);
        return result;
    }

    size_t size = input.size();
    int sum = 0;
    int product = 1;

    // SIMD loop for vectorization
    size_t loop_count = (size + 3) / 4;  // Divide size by 4, round up
    loop_count = max(loop_count, size_t(1));  // Ensure at least one iteration

    for (size_t i = 0; i < loop_count; ++i) {
        // Process elements in blocks of 4
        int a = input[i * 4];
        int b = input[i * 4 + 1];
        int c = input[i * 4 + 2];
        int d = input[i * 4 + 3];
        
        sum += a + b + c + d;
        product *= a * b * c * d;
    }

    // Handle remaining elements
    size_t remainder = size % 4;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < remainder; ++i) {
        int val = input[loop_count * 4 + i];
        sum += val;
        product *= val;
    }

    result.push_back(sum);
    result.push_back(product);
    
    return result;
}
```

This C++ code should match the behavior of the provided LLVM IR. The function `sum_product` computes the sum and product of the elements in the input vector and returns these values in a new vector. The code includes optimizations for SIMD processing and handles edge cases such as empty input vectors.
