Alright, I need to figure out how to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by carefully examining the IR code provided.

First, I notice that the module is named 'CPP_92.cpp', which suggests it's a C++ file. The function defined is `_Z7any_intfff`, which when demangled, likely translates to a function named `any_int` that takes three floats as arguments and returns a bool. 

Looking at the function attributes, it's marked as `mustprogress`, `nofree`, `nosync`, `nounwind`, `readnone`, `uwtable`, and `willreturn`. These attributes indicate that the function doesn't modify memory, doesn't have synchronization points, and doesn't unwind the stack, which simplifies decompilation.

The function starts by rounding each of the three float arguments using `llvm.round.f32`. It then compares the rounded value with the original using `fcmp une`, which checks if the two values are not equal. 

So, the first part of the code checks if rounding `a`, `b`, or `c` changes their values. If any of them change when rounded, the function returns `true`. If none of them change, it proceeds to check if any two of them sum up to the third.

For example, if `a + b == c`, `a + c == b`, or `b + c == a`, then it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Putting this together, the function `any_int` returns `true` if any of the three floats, when rounded, is an integer, or if any two of them sum up to the third. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

I'll structure the C++ code accordingly, implementing these checks step by step. I'll make sure to include the necessary headers and handle the function parameters correctly.

Finally, I'll test the code with some sample inputs to ensure it behaves as expected based on the IR code's logic.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code that can be run directly, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Function Logic**:
   - The function `_Z7any_intfff` (which likely decodes to `any_int`) takes three `float` parameters and returns a `bool`.
   - It checks if any of the floats, when rounded, are integers.
   - If not, it checks if any two floats sum up to the third.

2. **Implement the Logic in C++**:
   - Use `std::round` to round each float.
   - Compare the rounded value with the original to check for integer values.
   - Check all combinations of the sum of two floats against the third.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

bool any_int(float a, float b, float c) {
    // Check if rounding changes the value (i.e., not an integer when rounded)
    bool a_rounded = std::round(a) != a;
    bool b_rounded = std::round(b) != b;
    bool c_rounded = std::round(c) != c;

    // If any of the rounded values are not equal to the original, return true
    if (a_rounded || b_rounded || c_rounded) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check if any two numbers sum up to the third
    if ((a + b == c) || (a + c == b) || (b + c == a)) {
        return true;
    }

    // If none of the conditions are met
    return false;
}
```

3. **Explanation**:
   - **Rounding Check**: Each float is rounded and compared to the original. If any differ, it means the original wasn't an integer after rounding.
   - **Sum Check**: Verifies if any combination of two floats sums exactly to the third, indicating an integer relationship.

4. **Usage**:
   - Include `<cmath>` for `std::round`.
   - Call `any_int` with three float arguments to test the conditions.

You can now compile and run this C++ code to mimic the behavior described by the original LLVM IR.
