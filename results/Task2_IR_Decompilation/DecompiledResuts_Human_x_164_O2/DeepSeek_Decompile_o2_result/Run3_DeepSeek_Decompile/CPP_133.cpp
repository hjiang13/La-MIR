Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the IR code is doing.

Looking at the function definition, it's `_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`, which when demangled translates to `sum_squares(std::vector<float>)`. So the function takes a vector of floats and returns an integer.

The IR begins by getting elements from the vector. It loads the start and end iterators, which are pointers to the first and last elements. The code calculates the distance between these pointers to determine the number of elements.

Next, there's a loop setup. It calculates the number of iterations, handling both small and large loops. For small loops (fewer than 4 elements), it processes each element individually. For larger loops, it processes elements in pairs to optimize performance.

Inside the loop, each element is loaded, and `llvm.ceil.f32` is called to get the ceiling of the float value. The squared value is then added to a running total, which is accumulated into an integer result.

After processing all elements, the function returns the total sum of squares as an integer.

To translate this into C++, I'll create a function `sum_squares` that takes a `const std::vector<float>&`. I'll loop through each element, apply `std::ceil`, square it, and accumulate the result.

I also notice that the IR uses two different loop strategies, but in C++, it's more efficient to use a standard range-based for loop for simplicity and readability unless specific optimizations are needed.

So, putting it all together, the C++ code will loop through each float in the vector, compute the ceiling, square it, and sum these squared values, returning the total as an integer.

The provided LLVM IR code appears to implement a function `sum_squares` that takes a `std::vector<float>` and computes the sum of squares of the ceiling of each element. Here's the equivalent C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

int sum_squares(const std::vector<float>& v) {
    int result = 0;
    for (float x : v) {
        float ceiled = std::ceil(x);
        result += static_cast<int>(ceiled * ceiled);
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The C++ function `sum_squares` matches the IR's `sum_squares` function, taking a `const std::vector<float>&` as input and returning an `int`.

2. **Loop Through Elements**: The function iterates over each element in the vector using a range-based for loop.

3. **Ceiling Calculation**: For each element `x`, the code computes the ceiling using `std::ceil`.

4. **Square and Accumulate**: The ceiling value is squared, and the result is added to the running total `result`.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, the accumulated sum is returned as an integer.

This C++ code should compile and run correctly, producing the same output as the original IR code.
