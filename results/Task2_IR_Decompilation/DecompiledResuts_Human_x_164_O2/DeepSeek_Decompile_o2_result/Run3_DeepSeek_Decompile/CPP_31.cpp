Alright, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the function is doing.

Looking at the function signature, it's a function called `is_prime` that takes an `i64` and returns an `i1`, which is a boolean. So, it's checking if a number is prime.

The function starts by checking if the input is less than 2. If it is, it returns false because primes are greater than 1.

Next, it checks if the input is less than 4. If it is, it returns true because 2 and 3 are primes.

Then, there's a loop that starts at 2 and increments by 1 each time. Inside the loop, it calculates the remainder of the input divided by the loop variable. If the remainder is zero, it might be a composite number, but it doesn't immediately return false. Instead, it checks if the square of the loop variable is greater than the input. If it is, then the number is prime.

The loop continues until it either finds a divisor or determines that the number is prime.

I notice some optimizations here, like checking up to the square root of the number, which makes the function more efficient.

Now, translating this into C++, I'll structure it with the same logic. The function will handle edge cases first, then loop through potential divisors, checking divisibility and the square condition.

I'll make sure to include the correct function signature and return the appropriate boolean values based on the conditions.

After writing the code, I'll double-check to ensure it behaves the same as the IR code, handling all cases correctly.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code that corresponds to the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_prime(long long x) {
    if (x < 2)
        return false;
    if (x < 4)
        return true;
    
    long long i = 2;
    while (true) {
        long long rem = x % i;
        if (rem == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        long long sq = (i + 1) * (i + 1);
        if (sq > x) {
            return true;
        }
        i++;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << is_prime(2) << std::endl;   // true
    std::cout << is_prime(3) << std::endl;   // true
    std::cout << is_prime(4) << std::endl;   // false
    std::cout << is_prime(5) << std::endl;   // true
    std::cout << is_prime(6) << std::endl;   // false
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
The decompiled code implements a function `is_prime` that checks whether a given number is prime. The function:
1. Handles small values directly (x < 4).
2. Uses a loop to check for factors up to sqrt(x).
3. Returns true if no factors are found, indicating the number is prime.

The code includes an example `main` function to demonstrate usage. To use this code, simply compile and run it.
