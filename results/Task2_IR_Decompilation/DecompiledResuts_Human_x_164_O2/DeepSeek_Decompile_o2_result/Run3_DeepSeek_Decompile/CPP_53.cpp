Okay, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me look at the code provided.

The IR starts with some module information and target details, which I can ignore for now. The main part is the function definition: `_Z3addii`. I remember that in C++, when functions are compiled, they get mangled names. I think `_Z3addii` might be a mangled name. Let me try to demangle it.

Using a C++ name demangler, `_Z3addii` translates to `add(int, int)`. So the function is called `add` and takes two integers as parameters.

Looking at the function body, there's only one instruction: `%3 = add nsw i32 %1, %0`. This adds the two arguments and returns the result. The `nsw` flag means "no signed wrap", which implies that the addition doesn't wrap around in a way that would cause a signed integer overflow.

So the function is straightforward: it takes two integers, adds them, and returns the sum. There's no error checking or handling for overflow beyond the `nsw` flag, which suggests that the function assumes the addition won't cause a problematic overflow.

Putting this together, the C++ function should look like:

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

I don't see any other functions or complex structures in the provided IR, so this should be the complete source code.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Function**: The IR defines a function `_Z3addii`, which is a mangled C++ name. Demangling it reveals `add(int, int)`.

2. **Understand the Function Body**: The function adds two 32-bit integers (`i32`) and returns the result. The `nsw` flag indicates no signed wrap, suggesting the addition shouldn't cause a signed integer overflow.

3. **Translate to C++**: The function takes two `int` parameters, adds them, and returns the sum.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

You can save this code into a `.cpp` file and compile it normally.
