Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code that can be run directly. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. It defines a function named `_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which seems to be a C++ function. The name suggests it's counting numbers in a vector.

The function takes a `std::vector<int>` as an argument. In the IR, I see it's using `%"class.std::vector"` which confirms it's a vector. The function is supposed to return an `i32`, which is an integer.

Looking at the code, it starts by getting pointers to the vector's data. There's a check whether the end pointer equals the begin pointer. If they're equal, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the length by subtracting the begin pointer from the end, right-shifting by 2 (maybe dividing by 4 since it's a 32-bit integer), and taking the maximum with 1 using `llvm.umax.i64`.

Then, it loops through each element in the vector. For each element, it checks if it's greater than 0. If not, it goes into a loop where it processes negative numbers. It seems to be summing the digits of the absolute value of the number. It does this by repeatedly taking the remainder when divided by 10 and then dividing the number by 10 until it's 0. During this process, it accumulates the sum of the digits.

If the number is positive, it just adds 1 to the count. Otherwise, after processing the digits, it compares the sum of the digits with the original absolute value. If the sum is greater, it increments the count.

I think the function is counting how many numbers in the vector are "nice" based on some criteria, possibly involving their digits.

To translate this into C++, I'll need to:

1. Start with the function signature: `int count_nums(const std::vector<int>& nums)`.
2. Handle the edge case where the vector is empty by returning 0.
3. Initialize a count variable to 0.
4. Loop through each number in the vector.
5. For each number, if it's positive, increment count.
6. If it's negative, calculate the sum of its digits and compare it with the absolute value of the number. If the sum is greater, increment count.
7. Return the total count.

I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to handle the digit summing correctly for negative numbers by working with their absolute values.

I should test the code to ensure it behaves as expected, especially handling both positive and negative numbers properly. The loop for digit summing should correctly accumulate each digit without leaving any remainders.

Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I'll decompile it into C++ source code.

Here's the decompiled C++ function:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int count_nums(const vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) {
        return 0;
    }

    int count = 0;
    const int* begin = nums.data();
    const int* end = begin + nums.size();

    for (const int* p = begin; p < end; ++p) {
        int num = *p;
        if (num > 0) {
            count++;
        } else {
            int sum = 0;
            int temp = -num; // Work with absolute value
            while (temp > 0) {
                sum += temp % 10;
                temp /= 10;
            }
            if (sum > -num) { // Compare sum with original absolute value
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

This C++ function:
1. Checks if the vector is empty and returns 0 if true.
2. Initializes a count variable.
3. Iterates over each element in the vector.
4. For positive numbers, increments the count.
5. For negative numbers, calculates the sum of their digits and increments the count if the sum is greater than the absolute value of the number.
6. Returns the total count.

You can use this function by including the necessary headers and creating a `main` function to test it with sample data.
