Alright, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's start by looking through the IR to understand what it's doing.

First, I see the function definition for _Z11count_upperNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE. That's a mangled C++ name, so I'll demangle it. It translates to something like "int count_upper(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, ...>)".

Looking at the IR, the function starts by allocating a new string and initializing it with "AEIOU\00". It copies this string into the new string object. Then, it gets the length of the input string from the function argument.

The code then checks if the length is zero. If it is, it returns 0. If not, it starts processing the string. It uses some SIMD operations, specifically SSE, to check characters in the string. It loads the string data, processes it in chunks, and counts the occurrences of the uppercase vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'.

The loop continues until all characters are processed, and then it returns the count. The IR uses several helper functions like llvm.lifetime.start and llvm.memcpy for memory management and copies.

Putting this together, the C++ code would create a string initialized with "AEIOU", then iterate over each character in the input string, checking if it's one of these vowels and counting it. I can write this using standard C++ string operations.

I also notice that the IR uses some optimizations, but in the decompiled code, I can achieve the same functionality with a simple loop and conditional checks. So, the final code will loop through each character, compare against the vowels, and increment the count accordingly.

The input is a C++ function named `count_upper` that takes a `std::string` as an argument and returns the number of uppercase vowels ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') in the string.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int count_upper(const string& s) {
    string vowels = "AEIOU";
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        if (vowels.find(s[i]) != string::npos) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

You can save this code into a `.cpp` file and compile it with a C++ compiler to run it.
