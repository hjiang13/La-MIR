Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C or C++ source code. Let's start by looking at the IR code provided.

The function defined is `_Z15truncate_numberf(float %0)`. From the name, it seems like it's a C++ function because of the prefix. The function takes a float and returns a float.

Looking at the body of the function:
1. `%2 = fptosi float %0 to i32`: This converts the input float into a 32-bit integer. This effectively truncates the decimal part because converting a float to an integer truncates towards zero.
2. `%3 = sitofp i32 %2 to float`: This converts the integer back to a float. So now we have the truncated value as a float.
3. `%4 = fsub float %0, %3`: This subtracts the truncated float from the original input float. This would give the fractional part that was removed during truncation.
4. `ret float %4`: Returns the fractional part.

Putting this together, the function takes a float, truncates it to an integer, subtracts that from the original to get the fractional part, and returns it.

So in C++, the function would take a float, cast it to an int to truncate, subtract that from the original, and return the result.

I should write the C++ function accordingly. The function name in IR is `_Z15truncate_numberf`, which suggests that the original function is `float truncate_number(float)`. 

Wait, actually, in C++, the function would be something like `float truncate_number(float x)`. Inside, it does `return x - static_cast<float>(static_cast<int>(x));`

I should make sure to include the function signature correctly. Since the IR uses `float`, the C++ function should also use `float`.

So the complete function would be:

float truncate_number(float x) {
    return x - static_cast<float>(static_cast<int>(x));
}

I don't think any additional includes or namespaces are needed since it's a standalone function.

I should also check if there are any compiler-specific attributes or optimizations needed, but from the IR, it seems like it's a straightforward function without any special attributes beyond what's standard.

So, the final code should be a C++ file with this function defined.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Function Behavior**: The IR code defines a function that truncates a floating-point number and returns the fractional part after truncation.

2. **Translate IR Instructions**:
   - Convert the float input to an integer to truncate the decimal part.
   - Convert the integer back to a float.
   - Subtract this truncated float value from the original input to get the fractional part.
   - Return the fractional part.

3. **Construct the C++ Function**: Using the above understanding, the function `float truncate_number(float x)` is created to replicate the IR's functionality.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

float truncate_number(float x) {
    return x - static_cast<float>(static_cast<int>(x));
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    float x = 3.14159f;
    float fractional_part = truncate_number(x);
    cout << "Fractional part of " << x << " is " << fractional_part << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The function `truncate_number` takes a `float` as input.
- It casts the input to `int`, which truncates the decimal part.
- It then casts the `int` back to `float` and subtracts this from the original input to obtain the fractional part.
- The `main` function demonstrates how to use `truncate_number` with an example value and prints the result.

This code can be compiled and run directly to test the functionality.
