Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the IR code is doing.

Looking at the function definition, it's a void function that returns a vector. The function name seems to be _Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE, which when demangled, probably relates to a rolling maximum calculation on a vector.

The function takes two vector arguments: one as an output (sret) and one as input. It initializes the output vector by zeroing its memory with memset. Then it accesses various elements of the input vector, likely its size, capacity, and data pointers.

There's a loop starting at label 13. It loads elements from the input vector, compares them to find the maximum, and updates the output vector's data. There's also memory management involved with reallocating space if needed, using new and delete.

The function handles cases where the output vector might need to be reallocated to accommodate more elements, using memmove to shift data and throwing exceptions for length errors.

Putting this together, the function seems to implement a rolling maximum where each element in the output is the maximum of the previous elements in the input up to that point.

So, the C++ code should take two vectors: one for input and one for output. It initializes the output vector, iterates through the input, keeps track of the current maximum, and updates the output accordingly, handling memory as needed.

The provided LLVM IR code is a C++ function named `rolling_max` that takes two `std::vector<int>` arguments. The function calculates the rolling maximum of the input vector and stores the result in the output vector. Below is the decompiled C++ source code that matches the provided IR:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // for std::max

void rolling_max(std::vector<int>& result, const std::vector<int>& input) {
    // Initialize the result vector by zeroing its memory
    memset(&result.front(), 0, sizeof(int) * result.capacity());
    
    // Get pointers to the input vector's internal data
    const int* input_data = input.data();
    const int* input_end = input_data + input.size();

    // Get pointers to the result vector's internal data
    int* result_data = result.data();
    int* result_end = result_data + result.capacity();

    // Initialize the current maximum to the first element
    int current_max = input_data[0];
    result_data[0] = current_max;

    // Iterate through the input vector starting from the second element
    for (size_t i = 1; input_data + i < input_end;) {
        // Update the current maximum
        current_max = std::max(current_max, input_data[i]);
        result_data[i] = current_max;

        // Check if we've reached the end of the result's allocated space
        if (result_data + i >= result_end) {
            // If so, allocate new space for the result vector
            size_t new_capacity = result.capacity() * 2;
            int* new_data = new int[new_capacity];

            // Copy existing data to the new memory location
            memcpy(new_data, result_data, sizeof(int) * result.size());

            // Update the result vector's internal pointers
            delete[] result_data;
            result_data = new_data;
            result_end = result_data + new_capacity;

            // Update the result vector's size and capacity
            result.resize(new_capacity);
        }

        i++;
    }
}
```

This C++ code defines a function `rolling_max` that calculates the rolling maximum of an input vector and stores the result in an output vector. The function initializes the output vector, iterates through the input vector, updates the current maximum, and handles memory reallocation if necessary. You can use this function in your C++ program by including the appropriate headers and ensuring that the input and output vectors are properly initialized.

To use this function, you would typically call it like this:

```cpp
int main() {
    std::vector<int> input = {1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6};
    std::vector<int> result(input.size());

    rolling_max(result, input);

    // Use the result as needed
    return 0;
}
```

This code assumes that the input vector is non-empty and that the result vector has enough capacity to store the rolling maximum values. If you need to handle empty input vectors or other edge cases, you may need to add additional checks and error handling.
