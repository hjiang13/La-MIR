Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. The user provided the IR, and I need to figure out what it's doing. Let me start by looking at the function name: @_Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. 

Hmm, I remember that in C++, when you have a function name like this, it's been mangled. So I think I can demangle it to understand what's going on. Using a demangler, I find that this function is probably called rolling_max and takes a vector of integers and returns a vector of integers. So the function signature would be something like vector<int> rolling_max(vector<int> &input).

Looking at the IR, the function starts by taking two vector pointers: %0 and %1. It uses a tail call to memset, which zeros out the first vector, I think. Then it loads some pointers from the vectors, probably getting the start, end, and capacity.

There's an icmp eq checking if %9 and %10 are equal. If they are, it returns. Otherwise, it proceeds. This might be checking if the input vector is empty. So if the input is empty, the output is also empty.

Then there's a phi node in block 13, which suggests a loop. It looks like it's iterating through the elements. It's loading elements from %14 and %15, which are probably the current and previous elements. It compares the current element with the maximum so far and updates %24 accordingly.

There are some memory management parts where it checks if there's enough space and reallocates if necessary. It uses functions like _Znwm, which is operator new, and _ZdlPv, which is operator delete. It also calls __throw_length_error, which suggests it's handling exceptions when the vector needs to reallocate but can't.

In block 50, it seems to be moving data into a new buffer if the current one is too small. It uses memmove to copy the data and updates the vector's pointers.

Putting this together, the function seems to compute a rolling maximum. It initializes the output vector, iterates through the input, keeps track of the maximum, and resizes the output vector as needed.

So translating this into C++, I'd write a function that takes a vector by reference, creates a result vector, iterates through each element, keeps track of the current max, and pushes it into the result, resizing if necessary. It should handle cases where the input is empty and manage memory properly to avoid reallocations when it can.

I think the C++ code would look something like this: create the result vector, check if the input is empty, then loop through each element, updating the current max and adding it to the result. If the result needs more space, reallocate and copy the data over. Finally, return the result vector.

The given LLVM IR code appears to be implementing a function called `rolling_max` that operates on a `std::vector<int>`. Based on the IR, I can decompile it to C++ source code. Here's the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stdexcept>

using namespace std;

vector<int> rolling_max(const vector<int>& input) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (input.empty()) {
        return result;
    }

    int current_max = input[0];
    result.reserve(input.size());
    result.push_back(current_max);

    for (size_t i = 1; i < input.size(); ++i) {
        if (input[i] > current_max) {
            current_max = input[i];
        }
        result.push_back(current_max);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `rolling_max` takes a `const vector<int>&` as input and returns a `vector<int>`.
2. **Empty Check**: If the input vector is empty, it returns an empty result vector immediately.
3. **Initialization**: It initializes `current_max` with the first element of the input vector and adds it to the result.
4. **Reserve Space**: It reserves space in the result vector to avoid reallocations.
5. **Iterate and Compute**: It iterates through the input vector starting from the second element, updating `current_max` whenever it encounters a larger value, and appends `current_max` to the result vector.
6. **Return Result**: Finally, it returns the result vector containing the rolling maximum values.

This code efficiently computes the rolling maximum using a single pass through the input vector, making it an O(n) time complexity solution.
