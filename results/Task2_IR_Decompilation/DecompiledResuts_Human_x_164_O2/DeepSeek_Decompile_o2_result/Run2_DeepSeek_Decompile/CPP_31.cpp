Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code is doing. The function is called _Z8is_primex, which I think is a mangled name. Demangling it, it should be "is_prime" with an i64 parameter. So the function is a primality test.

Looking at the IR, it starts by checking if the input is less than 2. If so, it returns false. Then it checks if it's less than 4, which would mean it's 2 or 3, so it returns true.

If the number is 4 or more, it enters a loop. The loop variable starts at 2 and increments each time. For each iteration, it computes the remainder of the number divided by the loop variable. If the remainder is zero, it checks if the square of the loop variable is greater than the number. If so, it returns false because it found a divisor. Otherwise, it continues looping.

I need to translate this logic into C++. The loop in the IR seems to be a while loop that continues until the loop variable squared exceeds the input number. Each iteration checks divisibility and updates the loop variable.

I should handle edge cases first: numbers less than 2 are not prime, 2 and 3 are prime. For numbers greater than 3, check divisibility starting from 2, then incrementing by 1 each time. If any divisor is found, return false; otherwise, return true.

Wait, but the IR uses a phi node, which suggests a loop that starts at 2 and increments. So in C++, I'll use a while loop that starts at 2 and goes up to sqrt(n). For each i, check if n % i == 0. If it is, and i squared is greater than n, then it's not prime. Otherwise, continue.

I think that's the correct approach. So the C++ code should look similar to a standard trial division method for checking primes, handling small cases first and then looping through possible divisors.

The given LLVM IR code defines a function `is_prime` that checks if a given integer is a prime number. Here's the equivalent C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_prime(long long x) {
    if (x < 2)
        return false;
    if (x < 4)
        return true;
    
    long long i = 2;
    while (true) {
        long long rem = x % i;
        if (rem == 0) {
            if (i * i > x)
                return false;
            else
                break;
        }
        i++;
        long long i_sq = i * i;
        if (i_sq > x)
            break;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << "Is 2 prime? " << is_prime(2) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is 4 prime? " << is_prime(4) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is 5 prime? " << is_prime(5) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is 15 prime? " << is_prime(15) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `is_prime` takes a `long long` integer `x` as input and returns a boolean.

2. **Immediate Checks:**
   - If `x` is less than 2, it's not prime.
   - If `x` is between 2 and 4 (inclusive), it is prime (since 2 and 3 are primes).

3. **Loop for Divisibility Check:**
   - Start with `i = 2`.
   - In each iteration, compute the remainder `rem = x % i`.
   - If `rem` is 0, check if `i * i` is greater than `x`. If true, `x` is not prime; otherwise, break the loop.
   - Increment `i` and continue until `i * i` exceeds `x`.

4. **Return Result:**
   - If no divisors are found, return `true` indicating `x` is prime.

5. **Main Function for Testing:**
   - Example usage of `is_prime` with several test cases.

This code effectively translates the LLVM IR into a readable and functional C++ program that checks for prime numbers using trial division up to the square root of the number.
