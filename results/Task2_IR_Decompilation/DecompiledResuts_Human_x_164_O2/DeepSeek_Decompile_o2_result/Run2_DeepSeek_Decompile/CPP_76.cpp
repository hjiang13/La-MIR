Alright, I need to decompile the provided LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the function definition. The function is `_Z15is_simple_powerii`, which suggests it's a C++ function. Using a demangler, I find it translates to `is_simple_power(int, int)`.

The function returns a `bool` and takes two `int` parameters. Let's look at the parameters: `%0` and `%1`. Based on the context, I'll name them `base` and `exponent`.

Looking at the IR, the function starts with two comparisons: `icmp sgt i32 %0, 0` and `icmp sgt i32 %0, 1`. This translates to checking if `base` is greater than 0 and greater than 1. If `base` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns false because the loop isn't entered.

If `base` is greater than 1, the code enters a loop. Inside the loop, there's a phi node for `i` and `current`. `i` starts at 0 and increments each iteration, while `current` starts at 1 and gets multiplied by `base` each time.

The loop continues as long as `current` is less than or equal to `exponent` and `i` is less than 99. If either condition fails, the loop exits. If `current` equals `exponent`, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

I need to structure the C++ code to reflect this logic. I'll use a `while` loop, increment `i`, and multiply `current` by `base` each iteration. The loop breaks if `current` exceeds `exponent` or `i` reaches 100.

Finally, after the loop, if `current` equals `exponent`, return true; else, return false.

I should also consider edge cases, like when `exponent` is 0, but since the initial check returns false for `base <= 1`, perhaps the function assumes `exponent` is positive. But looking at the loop, `exponent` can be 0, but the function would return false because `current` starts at 1 and `exponent` is 0, so `current` > `exponent` immediately, and the loop doesn't run.

Wait, in the initial check, if `base` is 0, the function returns false. What if `base` is 1? Then the initial check `base > 1` is false, so the function returns false. But 1^anything is 1, so if `exponent` is 1, it should return true. Hmm, perhaps the function doesn't handle `base` being 1 correctly. But according to the code, if `base` is 1, the initial check `base > 1` is false, so it returns false, which is incorrect. Maybe the function has a bug, but according to the provided IR, that's how it behaves.

I'll proceed with the code as per the IR, noting this potential issue.

The given code is in LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation). To convert this back to C++ source code, we'll analyze the IR and map it to C++ constructs.

### Analysis of the IR Code:
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function is `is_simple_power`, which takes two `int` arguments and returns a `bool`.
   - The parameters are `base` and `exponent`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function first checks if `base` is greater than 0. If not, it returns `false`.
   - Then it checks if `base` is greater than 1. If not, it returns `false`.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop initializes `current` to 1 and `i` to 0.
   - It multiplies `current` by `base` in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `current` is less than or equal to `exponent` and `i` is less than 99.
   - If `current` equals `exponent`, it returns `true`.
   - If the loop exits without finding a match, it returns `false`.

### Decompiled C++ Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_simple_power(int base, int exponent) {
    if (base <= 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (base <= 1) {
        return false;
    }

    int current = 1;
    int i = 0;

    while (true) {
        int next = current * base;
        if (next > exponent) {
            break;
        }
        if (i >= 99) {
            break;
        }

        current = next;
        i++;
    }

    return current == exponent;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << is_simple_power(2, 8) << std::endl;  // Output: true
    std::cout << is_simple_power(2, 9) << std::endl;  // Output: false
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function `is_simple_power` checks if `exponent` is a power of `base`.
- It handles edge cases where `base` is 0 or 1, returning `false` immediately.
- The loop multiplies `current` by `base` iteratively, checking against `exponent`.
- The loop exits if `current` exceeds `exponent` or if it has iterated 100 times (to prevent infinite loops).
- Finally, it checks if `current` equals `exponent` and returns the result accordingly.

This code should be compilable and runnable as a standalone C++ program.
