<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by looking at the IR code provided. 

First, I see that the function is named @_Z9fizz_buzzi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, that should translate to something like fizz_buzzi with an integer parameter. 

Looking at the function definition, it's a mustprogress, nofree, etc., which probably means it's a simple function without too many side effects. The function takes an i32 (integer) and returns an i32.

The IR starts with an icmp (integer compare) checking if the input is greater than 0. If it is, it branches to label 5; otherwise, it goes to label 3. Label 3 seems to be the exit point where it returns 0 or some value from %25.

In label 5, there are phi nodes for %6 and %7. Phi nodes mean we're dealing with loops. %6 seems to be the loop variable, starting at 0 and incrementing each time. %7 is the sum or the count of certain conditions.

Then, there are checks for whether %6 modulo 11 is not zero and modulo 13 is not zero. If both are true, it checks if %6 is zero. If that's the case, it goes to label 24; else, it continues to label 15.

In label 15, another loop: it checks the remainder of %16 (which is %6 from the previous loop) modulo 10. If it's equal to 7, it adds 1 to %17, which is the sum. Then it divides %16 by 10 and checks if it's less than 10. If so, it breaks out of the loop; else, continues.

Back in label 24, it increments %6 by 1 and checks if it's equal to the input %0. If yes, it exits to label 3; otherwise, loops back.

Putting this together, it seems like the function is counting numbers from 1 to n that are not divisible by 11 or 13, but also have a digit equal to 7. Each time such a number is found, it adds 1 to the count.

Wait, no, looking again, the condition is that if a number is divisible by both 11 and 13, then it's skipped, but if it's zero, maybe it's a special case. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, the condition in label 5 is checking if %6 is not divisible by 11 and not divisible by 13. So, if both conditions are true, then it proceeds. But then there's a select between whether to continue or not. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the logic here.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is summing 1 for each number that either is divisible by both 11 and 13 or has a digit equal to 7. Or maybe it's more like a modified FizzBuzz problem, where certain conditions add to the count.

Wait, the function returns an integer, so maybe it's counting how many numbers up to n meet a specific condition. Let me think about the loops.

In label 5, for each number starting from 0, it's checking if the number is not divisible by 11 and not by 13. If both are not zero, then it proceeds to check if the number is zero. If not, it goes into another loop where it checks each digit for being 7. Each time it finds a 7, it adds 1 to the sum.

Wait, no, in label 15, it's taking the current number, checking each digit by modulo 10, and if any digit is 7, it adds 1 to the sum. So for each number not divisible by 11 or 13, it checks each digit, and if any digit is 7, it increments the count.

But looking at the phi nodes and the variables, perhaps %4 is the total count. So the function is counting numbers up to %0 where the number is not divisible by 11 or 13, and has at least one digit equal to 7.

Wait, but the condition in label 5 is %9 and %11, which are checking that the number is not divisible by 11 and not divisible by 13. So, if a number is not divisible by either, then we check if any digit is 7. If so, we add 1 to the count.

So the function is: for each number from 1 to n, if the number is not divisible by 11 and not divisible by 13, then check if any digit is 7. If yes, increment the count. So the return value is the total count of such numbers.

Wait, but the initial check in label 5 is if the input is greater than 0. If not, return 0. Then for each number starting from 1, check if it's not divisible by 11 and not by 13. Then, for such numbers, check each digit for 7. Each occurrence adds 1 to the count.

So the C++ function would loop from 1 to n, for each i, check if i is not divisible by 11 and not by 13, then check each digit of i for 7, and count each occurrence.

Wait, but in the code, for each i (starting at 0, but seems to go up to n), if i is not divisible by 11 and 13, then in the inner loop, check each digit. So the count is the number of digits equal to 7 in numbers not divisible by 11 or 13.

But perhaps the function is returning the number of such numbers, not the number of digits. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is similar to FizzBuzz, but instead of printing, it's counting numbers that meet certain conditions. But in this case, the conditions are related to divisibility and digits.

Let me try to write a C++ function that does this. It should take an integer n, initialize a count to 0, loop from 1 to n, for each i, check if i is not divisible by 11 and not by 13. If so, then check each digit of i to see if any digit is 7. If yes, increment the count.

Wait, but in the code, the count is incremented by 1 for each such digit, not per number. So if a number has two 7s, it would add 2 to the count.

Wait, no, looking at the code, in label 15, for each digit, if it's 7, add 1 to the sum. So for a number with multiple 7s, it would add multiple times. So the function is counting the total number of 7 digits in numbers up to n that are not divisible by 11 or 13.

Alternatively, perhaps it's counting the numbers where either they are not divisible by 11 and 13, or their digits include 7. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The function starts with %0, which is n. It initializes %4 to 0. Then, for each i from 1 to n, it checks if i is not divisible by 11 and not by 13. If both are true, then it enters the inner loop to check each digit. For each digit that is 7, it adds 1 to the sum. So the total sum is the count of 7 digits in numbers from 1 to n that are not divisible by 11 or 13.

So, the function would look something like:

int fizz_buzzi(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i % 11 != 0 && i % 13 != 0) {
            int num = i;
            while (num > 0) {
                int digit = num % 10;
                if (digit == 7) {
                    count++;
                }
                num /= 10;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

Wait, but looking at the IR, the inner loop in label 15 seems to be checking each digit, and for each 7, it adds 1. So yes, that's what this code does.

I think that's the correct decompilation. So the function counts the number of 7 digits in numbers from 1 to n, but only for numbers not divisible by 11 or 13.
</think>

The provided LLVM IR code can be decompiled into the following C++ function. This function counts the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers from 1 to `n`, but only for numbers that are not divisible by 11 or 13.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fizz_buzzi(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i % 11 != 0 && i % 13 != 0) {
            int num = i;
            while (num > 0) {
                int digit = num % 10;
                if (digit == 7) {
                    count++;
                }
                num /= 10;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << "Result: " << fizz_buzzi(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `fizz_buzzi` that iterates through each number up to `n`, checks divisibility by 11 and 13, and counts the number of '7's in the digits of numbers that meet the criteria. The `main` function provides a simple interface to test it.
