Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I need to decompile some LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. The user provided the IR, and my task is to translate it into something that can be run directly. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by reading through the IR code to understand what it's doing. The function is named @_Z6fibfibi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, that would translate to "fib(int)" or something similar, so it's a Fibonacci function.

Looking at the function, it starts by allocating space for an array of 100 integers. That's done with the alloca instruction, which in C++ would be a local array, probably declared as int fibArray[100] or something like that. The bitcast and calls to llvm.lifetime.start and end suggest that the compiler is managing the lifetime of this stack-allocated array, which is standard practice.

Next, the function stores some initial values into the array. The first few stores set the 0th, 1st, and 2nd elements to 0, 0, and 1, respectively. So, in C++, that would be fibArray[0] = 0; fibArray[1] = 0; fibArray[2] = 1;. It looks like this is setting up the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence.

Then there's an icmp (integer compare) instruction checking if the input is less than 3. If it is, it branches to label 31, which seems to handle the return value. Otherwise, it proceeds to label 8.

At label 8, it increments the input by 1, checks if it's equal to 4, and branches accordingly. There's a loop involved here, as indicated by the !llvm.loop metadata. This suggests that the function is using some kind of loop to compute Fibonacci numbers beyond the base cases.

Looking deeper, there's a section that seems to handle even and odd indices separately. For even indices, it's computing fib(n) = fib(n-2) + fib(n-3), and for odd indices, it's using a different set of previous values. This might be an optimization to compute the Fibonacci numbers more efficiently without recursion.

I notice that there are multiple phi nodes, which in LLVM IR are used to represent the merging of values from different control flow paths. This suggests that the loop is using some variables that are updated each iteration, and those variables are being merged based on the path taken.

The function then loads values from the array, performs some additions, and stores the result back into the array. This is characteristic of an iterative approach to computing Fibonacci numbers, where each new value is based on previous ones stored in the array.

Finally, the function retrieves the value from the array based on the input index and returns it after ending the lifetime of the allocated array.

Putting this together, the function is implementing an iterative Fibonacci calculation with some optimizations, possibly using a technique called "fast doubling" or a similar method to compute the values efficiently. The array is used to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.

Now, to translate this into C++. I'll need to:

1. Declare a local array of 100 integers.
2. Initialize the base cases.
3. Handle the input being less than 3 by returning the appropriate value.
4. For larger inputs, use a loop to compute the Fibonacci numbers up to the given index, using the array to store intermediate values.
5. Return the computed Fibonacci number.

I should also ensure that the loop correctly handles both even and odd cases, updating the necessary variables each iteration to reflect the current state of the computation.

Let me sketch this out:

- Initialize fibArray with base cases.
- If n is 0 or 1, return 0.
- If n is 2, return 1.
- For n >=3, loop from 3 to n, computing each fibArray[i] based on previous values.
- Return fibArray[n].

Wait, but looking back at the IR, it seems to handle even and odd indices with different calculations, which might be an optimization. So perhaps the C++ code uses a similar approach, handling even and odd cases within the loop to compute the values more efficiently.

I think I have a good grasp now. The C++ code will declare the array, handle base cases, and then iterate, updating the array with each Fibonacci number, using the stored values to compute subsequent ones. The return statement will fetch the nth value from the array.

I should also consider the loop structure. The IR has multiple labels and branches, which in C++ would translate into loops and conditional statements. The phi nodes suggest that variables are being updated and used across iterations, so I'll need to ensure those variables are correctly managed in the C++ loop.

Putting it all together, the C++ function should look something like this:

- Declare the array.
- Initialize the first few elements.
- Check if the input is less than 3 and return immediately if so.
- Otherwise, loop from 3 to the input value, computing each Fibonacci number and storing it.
- Return the computed value.

I think that's the plan. Now, let me write the code accordingly, making sure to handle all the cases and optimize as the IR suggests.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we analyze the operations and translate them into equivalent C++ constructs. The function computes Fibonacci numbers using an iterative approach with optimizations for even and odd indices.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fib(int n) {
    int fibArray[100];
    fibArray[0] = 0;
    fibArray[1] = 0;
    fibArray[2] = 1;

    if (n < 3) {
        return fibArray[n];
    }

    int a = 0, b = 1, c, d = 1;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            c = a + b;
            fibArray[i] = c;
            a = d;
            b = c;
        } else {
            d = b + c;
            fibArray[i] = d;
            b = c;
            c = d;
        }
    }

    return fibArray[n];
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << "Fibonacci number: " << fib(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Array Initialization:** The function initializes a local array `fibArray` with base cases for Fibonacci numbers.
- **Base Case Handling:** Directly returns values for inputs less than 3.
- **Iterative Calculation:** Uses a loop to compute each Fibonacci number up to `n`, optimizing with separate handling for even and odd indices to reduce redundant calculations.
- **Main Function:** Provides a simple interface to test the `fib` function by taking user input and displaying the result.

This code efficiently computes the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative method with optimizations, mirroring the approach in the provided LLVM IR.
