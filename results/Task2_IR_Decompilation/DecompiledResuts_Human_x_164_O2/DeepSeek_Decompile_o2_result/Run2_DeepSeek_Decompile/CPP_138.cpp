Alright, I'm trying to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding the IR code step by step.

The function defined is `_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni`, which I think is a C++ function because of the naming convention. The function takes an integer `%0` as an argument and returns a boolean (`i1`).

Looking at the code inside the function:

1. `%2 = and i32 %0, 1`: This line is performing a bitwise AND between the input `%0` and 1. This effectively checks if the least significant bit of `%0` is 1, which determines if the number is odd or even.

2. `%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0`: This line compares `%2` with 0. If `%2` is 0, it means the least significant bit was 0, so the number is even. `%3` will be `true` (1) if even, `false` (0) otherwise.

3. `%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7`: This line checks if `%0` is greater than 7. `%4` will be `true` (1) if `%0` > 7, else `false` (0).

4. `%5 = and i1 %4, %3`: This line performs a logical AND between `%4` and `%3`. So, `%5` will be `true` only if both `%4` and `%3` are `true`, meaning the number is even and greater than 7.

Finally, `ret i1 %5` returns `%5` as the result of the function.

Putting this all together, the function returns `true` if the input is an even number greater than 7. So, the C++ function should take an `int` and return a `bool` with those conditions.

I should also consider the function's name. The IR function name `_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni` suggests it's checking if a number is even and perhaps part of a sum, but based on the logic, it's specifically checking if it's even and greater than 7.

Now, I'll write the C++ function accordingly, making sure to handle the conditions correctly.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we analyze the instructions and translate them into equivalent C++ logic. The function checks if the input integer is both even and greater than 7.

**Decompiled C++ Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int num) {
    bool is_even = (num & 1) == 0;
    bool is_greater_than_7 = num > 7;
    return is_even && is_greater_than_7;
}

int main() {
    int num;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> num;
    if (is_equal_to_sum_even(num)) {
        std::cout << "The number is even and greater than 7." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The number is either odd or 7 and below." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `is_equal_to_sum_even` that returns `true` if the input is even and greater than 7, and `false` otherwise. The `main` function demonstrates its usage by taking user input and displaying the result.
