I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a text-based representation of a program's assembly code, and it is not a standardized format. Therefore, I cannot decompile it without additional information or context.

If you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can help you with, please feel free to ask!
