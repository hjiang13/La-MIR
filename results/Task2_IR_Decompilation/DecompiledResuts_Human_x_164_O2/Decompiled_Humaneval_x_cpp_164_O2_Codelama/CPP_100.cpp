I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code. The code is not in a format that I can understand.

However, I can tell you that the code appears to be in the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) format, which is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program. It is used by the LLVM compiler infrastructure to represent the code being compiled.

To decompile the code, you would need to use a tool that can convert the IR code into a human-readable format, such as C or C++ source code. One such tool is the "llvm-dis" command, which is part of the LLVM toolchain. You can use it to disassemble the IR code and generate a textual representation of the code.

Here is an example of how you might use the "llvm-dis" command to decompile the provided IR code:
```
$ llvm-dis -o output.ll input.ll
```
This will generate a file called "output.ll" that contains the decompiled code. You can then use a text editor or IDE to view the code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
