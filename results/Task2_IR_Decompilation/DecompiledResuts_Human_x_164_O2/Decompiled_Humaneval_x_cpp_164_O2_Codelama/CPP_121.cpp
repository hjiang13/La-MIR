I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a valid format. The IR code should be in a human-readable format, such as the one generated by the `llvm-ir` tool. Additionally, the IR code should be a valid LLVM IR program, with all necessary metadata and declarations included.

If you have the IR code in a different format, you may need to use a tool such as `llvm-as` to assemble it into a valid LLVM IR program before attempting to decompile it. Alternatively, you can use a tool such as `llvm-dis` to disassemble the IR code into assembly code, which can then be decompiled using a tool such as `objconv`.

Please provide the IR code in a valid format, and I will be happy to help you with the decompilation.
