I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not a valid input. The IR code you provided is not a valid LLVM IR code, and it does not contain any valid instructions.

To decompile an IR code, you need to provide a valid LLVM IR code that can be compiled by the LLVM compiler. The IR code should contain valid instructions and should not have any syntax errors.

If you have any questions or need help with decompiling an IR code, please let me know and I'll be happy to assist you.
