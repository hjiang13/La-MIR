The provided IR code is for a function that takes a vector of integers and an integer as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the sum of the elements in the vector is below a certain threshold.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
bool below_threshold(vector<int> &v, int threshold) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
    sum += v[i];
    if (sum >= threshold) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original source code, but it should be functionally equivalent. The decompiled code uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the vector, while the original source code uses a while loop. Additionally, the decompiled code uses the `size()` method to get the size of the vector, while the original source code uses a hardcoded value.
