The provided IR code is a low-level representation of a C++ function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains correctly matched brackets. The function uses a loop to iterate through the characters of the input string and maintains a "level" variable to keep track of the current nesting level of brackets. If the level becomes negative at any point, it indicates that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, and the function returns false. If the level is non-zero at the end of the loop, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, and the function also returns false. If the level is zero at the end of the loop, it means that the brackets are correctly matched, and the function returns true.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool correct_bracketing(string brackets) {
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < brackets.length(); i++) {
        if (brackets[i] == '(') {
            level++;
        } else if (brackets[i] == ')') {
            level--;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    if (level != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ source code, but it is functionally equivalent. The decompiled code uses a for loop to iterate through the characters of the input string, while the original source code uses a while loop. Additionally, the decompiled code uses the `length()` method to get the length of the input string, while the original source code uses the `size()` method.
