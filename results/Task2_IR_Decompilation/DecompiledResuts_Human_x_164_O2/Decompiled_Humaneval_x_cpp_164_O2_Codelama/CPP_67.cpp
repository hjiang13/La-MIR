I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. Additionally, I am not able to perform decompilation of code as it is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the code and the compiler that generated it.

However, I can suggest some resources that may be helpful in decompiling the code:

1. The LLVM documentation provides a detailed explanation of the LLVM IR format and the tools that can be used to work with it.
2. The LLVM project provides a tool called "llvm-dis" that can be used to disassemble LLVM IR code into assembly code.
3. There are also several third-party tools available that can be used to decompile LLVM IR code, such as "llvm-decompile" and "llvm-decomp".

It's important to note that decompilation of code is a complex task and may not always produce accurate results, especially if the code has been optimized or obfuscated.
