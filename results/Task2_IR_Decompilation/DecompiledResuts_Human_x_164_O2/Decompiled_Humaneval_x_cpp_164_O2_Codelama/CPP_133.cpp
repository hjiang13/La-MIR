The provided IR code is a function named `_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` that takes a vector of floats as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be computing the sum of the squares of the elements in the input vector.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int sum_squares(std::vector<float> &input) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < input.size(); i++) {
    sum += input[i] * input[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code, as the IR code has been optimized and transformed by the compiler. However, the decompiled code should be functionally equivalent to the original C++ code.
