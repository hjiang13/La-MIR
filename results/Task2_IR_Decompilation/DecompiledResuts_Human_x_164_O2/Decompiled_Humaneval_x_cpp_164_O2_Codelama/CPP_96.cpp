I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in the correct format. The IR code should be in a human-readable format, with each instruction on a separate line and indented correctly. Additionally, the code should include the necessary metadata, such as the module ID and the target triple.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please let me know and I will do my best to help.
