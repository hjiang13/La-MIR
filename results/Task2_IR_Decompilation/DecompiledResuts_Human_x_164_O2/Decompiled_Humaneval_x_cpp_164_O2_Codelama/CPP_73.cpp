The provided IR code is for a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the smallest change in the vector that can be made to make it a valid bracket sequence.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int smallest_change(vector<int> &v) {
  int n = v.size();
  int i = 0;
  int j = 0;
  int count = 0;
  int min_count = INT_MAX;
  while (i < n) {
    if (v[i] == 1) {
      count++;
    } else {
      count--;
    }
    if (count < 0) {
      count = 0;
    }
    if (count > min_count) {
      min_count = count;
      j = i + 1;
    }
    i++;
  }
  return min_count;
}
```
This function iterates over the input vector and keeps track of the number of open brackets minus the number of closed brackets. If the count drops below 0, it resets the count to 0. If the count is greater than the current minimum count, it updates the minimum count and the corresponding index. Finally, it returns the minimum count.
