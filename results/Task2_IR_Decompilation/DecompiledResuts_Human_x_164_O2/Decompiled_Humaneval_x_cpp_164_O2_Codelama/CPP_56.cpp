The provided IR code is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets in the string are correctly matched. The function is implemented using a loop that iterates over the characters in the string and keeps track of the nesting level of the brackets. If the nesting level becomes negative at any point, the function returns false. If the loop completes and the nesting level is zero, the function returns true.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool correct_bracketing(string brackets) {
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < brackets.length(); i++) {
        if (brackets[i] == '(') {
            level++;
        } else if (brackets[i] == ')') {
            level--;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return level == 0;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code, as the IR code does not include the `using namespace std;` statement. However, the decompiled code is functionally equivalent to the original code.
