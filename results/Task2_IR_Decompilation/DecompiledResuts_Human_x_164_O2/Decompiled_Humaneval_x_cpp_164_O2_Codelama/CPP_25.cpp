I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. 

However, I can tell you that the IR code is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program. It is not a human-readable format, and it is not intended to be decompiled into C or C++ source code.

If you have access to the original source code, I would recommend using a decompiler to convert the compiled code back into its original form. However, if you do not have access to the original source code, you may be able to use a disassembler to convert the compiled code into assembly code, which could then be used as a starting point for reverse engineering the program.

It's important to note that decompilation and reverse engineering are complex processes that require a deep understanding of computer architecture, programming languages, and software engineering. It's not a task that can be easily accomplished, and it's not always possible to obtain the original source code from a compiled program.
