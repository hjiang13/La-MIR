The provided IR code is a function named `_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` that takes a single argument of type `class.std::__cxx11::basic_string`. The function returns an integer value.

Based on the IR code, the function appears to be a simple implementation of the `strlen` function, which returns the length of a null-terminated string. The function takes a single argument, which is a pointer to the first character of the string. The function then iterates through the string, incrementing a counter for each character until it reaches the null terminator. The function returns the value of the counter, which represents the length of the string.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the function:
```
int strlen(const char* str) {
    int len = 0;
    while (*str++) {
        len++;
    }
    return len;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original source code, but it is functionally equivalent. The decompiled code uses a `while` loop to iterate through the string, while the original source code uses a `for` loop. Additionally, the decompiled code uses the `const` keyword to indicate that the `str` parameter is a constant pointer, while the original source code does not include this keyword.
