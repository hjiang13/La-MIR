I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a low-level representation of a program, and it is not in a format that is easily readable by humans. Additionally, the code appears to be obfuscated, which makes it even more difficult to understand.

If you have access to the original source code, I would recommend using a decompiler to convert the code back into a human-readable format. However, if you do not have access to the original source code, you may need to use a disassembler to convert the code into assembly language, which can then be manually translated back into C or C++ code.

It's important to note that decompiling code can be a complex and time-consuming process, and it may not always be possible to accurately reconstruct the original source code. Additionally, decompiling code can raise legal and ethical concerns, as it may involve reverse-engineering proprietary software or intellectual property. Therefore, it's important to use decompilation tools responsibly and with the appropriate legal and ethical considerations in mind.
