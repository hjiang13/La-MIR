The provided IR code is a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the elements in the vector. The function is implemented using a loop that iterates over the elements of the vector and computes the sum of the squares.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <cstdint>
#include <vector>

int32_t sum_squares(std::vector<int32_t>* vec) {
  int32_t sum = 0;
  for (int32_t i = 0; i < vec->size(); i++) {
    sum += (*vec)[i] * (*vec)[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code, but it is functionally equivalent. The decompiled code uses a loop to iterate over the elements of the vector, while the original code uses a range-based for loop. Additionally, the decompiled code uses the `std::vector` class to represent the vector, while the original code uses a custom vector class.
