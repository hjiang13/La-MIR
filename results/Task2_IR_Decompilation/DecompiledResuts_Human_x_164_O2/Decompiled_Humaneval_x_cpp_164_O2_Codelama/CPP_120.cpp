I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code. It is not in a format that I can understand.

However, I can tell you that the IR code you provided is in a format called LLVM IR, which is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program. It is used by the LLVM compiler infrastructure to represent the code being compiled.

To decompile the IR code, you would need to use a tool that can understand LLVM IR and translate it into a higher-level language such as C or C++. One such tool is the LLVM Disassembler, which can be used to convert LLVM IR into assembly code.

Alternatively, you could use a tool such as the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) Viewer, which can be used to visualize the IR code and understand its structure.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, please let me know.
