I'm happy to help you with that! However, I need to clarify that the provided IR code is not a valid LLVM IR code. It appears to be a mix of LLVM IR and C++ code, which makes it difficult for me to decompile it accurately.

To decompile the provided code, I would need the original LLVM IR code that was used to generate the assembly code. Alternatively, if you have the C++ source code that was used to generate the assembly code, I can try to decompile that instead.

Please let me know if you have the original LLVM IR code or the C++ source code, and I'll do my best to help you with the decompilation.
