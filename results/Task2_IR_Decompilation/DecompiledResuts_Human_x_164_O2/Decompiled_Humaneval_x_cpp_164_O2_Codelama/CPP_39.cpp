The provided IR code is for a function that takes an integer as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be a prime number sieve, where the input integer is used to determine the number of iterations of the sieve.

Here is the decompiled C code for the function:
```
int prime_fib(int n) {
    int i, j, k, m;
    int a, b, c, d;

    a = 1;
    b = 2;
    c = 0;
    d = 0;

    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        j = a + b;
        k = j % 4;
        if (k == 0) {
            m = j / 4;
            c = c + m;
        }
        a = b;
        b = j;
    }

    return c;
}
```
The decompiled code is a prime number sieve that uses the Fibonacci sequence to generate prime numbers. The function takes an integer `n` as input, and it returns the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`.

The function starts by initializing the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to 1, 2, 0, and 0, respectively. These variables are used to store the current number being tested for primality, the next number in the Fibonacci sequence, the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`, and a temporary variable used in the sieve.

The function then enters a loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, the function calculates the next number in the Fibonacci sequence (`j = a + b`) and checks if it is divisible by 4 (`k = j % 4`). If `k` is 0, the function increments the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n` (`c = c + m`).

After the loop, the function returns the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`.

Note that the decompiled code is not the original C code that was used to generate the IR, but it is a valid C code that implements the same algorithm as the original code.
