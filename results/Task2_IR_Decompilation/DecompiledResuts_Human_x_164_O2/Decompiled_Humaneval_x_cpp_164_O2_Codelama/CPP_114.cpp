The provided IR code is a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the minimum sum of any subarray of the vector. The function is implemented using a divide-and-conquer approach, where the vector is recursively divided into smaller subarrays until the sum of each subarray is computed. The minimum sum is then returned.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <vector>

int minSubArraySum(std::vector<int> &nums) {
  if (nums.size() == 1) {
    return nums[0];
  }

  int mid = nums.size() / 2;
  int leftSum = minSubArraySum(std::vector<int>(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + mid));
  int rightSum = minSubArraySum(std::vector<int>(nums.begin() + mid, nums.end()));

  int minLeft = leftSum;
  int minRight = rightSum;
  for (int i = mid; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    minLeft = std::min(minLeft, leftSum + nums[i]);
    minRight = std::min(minRight, rightSum + nums[i]);
  }

  return std::min(minLeft, minRight);
}
```
The decompiled code is a recursive function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the minimum sum of any subarray of the vector. The function first checks if the size of the vector is 1, in which case the minimum sum is simply the value of the single element. Otherwise, the vector is divided into two smaller subarrays, and the minimum sum of each subarray is computed recursively. The minimum sum is then returned.

Note that the decompiled code uses the `std::min` function to compute the minimum of two values. This function is defined in the `<algorithm>` header file, which is not included in the decompiled code. To use this function, you will need to include the header file in your code.
