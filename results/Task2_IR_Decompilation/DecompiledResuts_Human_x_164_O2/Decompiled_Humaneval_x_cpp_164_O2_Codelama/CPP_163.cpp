The provided IR code is for a function that generates integers in a given range and stores them in a vector. The function takes three parameters: a vector, a start index, and an end index. The function then iterates over the range of integers from the start index to the end index, and for each integer, it checks if the vector is empty. If the vector is empty, it adds the integer to the vector. If the vector is not empty, it checks if the integer is less than the first element in the vector. If it is, it inserts the integer at the beginning of the vector. If it is not, it checks if the integer is greater than the last element in the vector. If it is, it appends the integer to the end of the vector. If it is not, it inserts the integer at the appropriate position in the vector.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
void generate_integers(vector<int>& vec, int start, int end) {
  for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    if (vec.empty()) {
      vec.push_back(i);
    } else if (i < vec[0]) {
      vec.insert(vec.begin(), i);
    } else if (i > vec[vec.size() - 1]) {
      vec.push_back(i);
    } else {
      int j = 0;
      while (j < vec.size() && vec[j] < i) {
        j++;
      }
      vec.insert(vec.begin() + j, i);
    }
  }
}
```
Note that the decompiled code may not be exactly the same as the original source code, as the IR code may have been optimized or transformed in various ways during the compilation process. However, the decompiled code should be functionally equivalent to the original source code.
