Sure, I can help you with that. The provided IR code appears to be a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains correctly nested parentheses.

Here's the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool correct_bracketing(string brackets) {
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < brackets.length(); i++) {
        if (brackets[i] == '(') {
            level += 1;
        } else if (brackets[i] == ')') {
            level -= 1;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    if (level != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
The function takes a string as input and iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an opening parenthesis, the level is incremented by 1. If the character is a closing parenthesis, the level is decremented by 1. If the level ever becomes negative, the function returns false, indicating that the parentheses are not correctly nested. If the level is not 0 at the end of the iteration, the function also returns false. If the string is correctly nested, the function returns true.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
