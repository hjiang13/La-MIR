The provided IR code is for a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be a simple loop that iterates over the elements of the vector and performs some arithmetic operations on them.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int can_arrange(std::vector<int> &vec) {
  int result = -1;
  int size = vec.size();
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    int val = vec[i];
    if (val < 0) {
      result = i;
      break;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```
The decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code, but it should be functionally equivalent. The main differences are in the way the loop is implemented and the handling of the `result` variable. In the original code, the `result` variable is initialized to -1 and is only updated if a negative value is found in the vector. In the decompiled code, the `result` variable is initialized to 0 and is updated to the index of the first negative value found in the vector.

It's worth noting that the decompiled code is not optimized and may not be as efficient as the original code. However, it should still be functionally correct and can be used as a starting point for further optimization or modification.
