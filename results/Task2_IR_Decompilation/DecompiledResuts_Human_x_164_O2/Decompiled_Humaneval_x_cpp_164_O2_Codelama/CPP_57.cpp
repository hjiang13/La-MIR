I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a valid format. The IR code should be in a human-readable format, with each instruction on a new line and indented correctly. Additionally, the code should include the necessary metadata, such as the module ID and the target triple.

If you are looking for a way to decompile LLVM IR code, you can use the `llvm-dis` tool, which is part of the LLVM project. This tool can take an LLVM IR file as input and produce an assembly file or a human-readable text file as output.

Here is an example of how to use `llvm-dis` to decompile an LLVM IR file:
```
llvm-dis -o output.s input.ll
```
This will produce an assembly file called `output.s` from the LLVM IR file `input.ll`.

Alternatively, you can use the `llvm-dis` tool with the `-S` option to produce a human-readable text file instead of an assembly file. For example:
```
llvm-dis -S -o output.txt input.ll
```
This will produce a text file called `output.txt` from the LLVM IR file `input.ll`.
