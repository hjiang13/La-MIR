I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in the correct format. The IR code should be in the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) format, which is a text-based representation of the assembly code.

If you have the IR code in a file, you can use the `llvm-dis` tool to disassemble it into assembly code. Here's an example command:
```bash
llvm-dis -o output.s input.ll
```
This will generate an assembly file called `output.s` from the IR code in `input.ll`.

Alternatively, you can use the `llc` tool to compile the IR code into assembly code. Here's an example command:
```bash
llc -o output.s input.ll
```
This will generate an assembly file called `output.s` from the IR code in `input.ll`.

Once you have the assembly code, you can use a disassembler to convert it into C or C++ source code. There are several disassemblers available, including `objdump` and `IDA Pro`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
