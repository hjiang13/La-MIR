The provided IR code is a function named `_Z10string_xorNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_` that takes three arguments: `sret`, `nocapture readonly %1`, and `nocapture readonly %2`. The function appears to be a string xor operation, where the characters in the first two strings are xored and the result is stored in the third string.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
#include <string>

using namespace std;

void _Z10string_xorNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_(
    basic_string<char>* sret,
    const basic_string<char>& arg1,
    const basic_string<char>& arg2) {

  for (int i = 0; i < arg1.length(); i++) {
    sret[i] = arg1[i] ^ arg2[i];
  }
}
```
Note that the function is marked as `dso_local`, which means it is only visible within the dynamic shared object (DSO) that it is defined in. It is also marked as `noinline`, which means it should not be inlined by the compiler.
