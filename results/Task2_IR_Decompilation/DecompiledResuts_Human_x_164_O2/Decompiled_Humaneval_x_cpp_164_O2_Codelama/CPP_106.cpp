I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code. The code is not in a format that I can understand.

However, I can tell you that the code appears to be in LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) format. If you would like me to try to decompile it, please provide me with the code in a format that I can understand, such as assembly language or machine code.

Alternatively, if you have the source code that generated the IR code, I can try to decompile the source code instead. Please provide me with the source code, and I will do my best to decompile it for you.
