I am unable to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code appears to be in a binary format, which I am not able to process.

To decompile the IR code, I would need access to the original source code or a human-readable version of the IR code. Alternatively, you could use a tool such as the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) viewer to view the IR code in a more human-readable format.

If you have access to the original source code, I would be happy to help you decompile it. Please provide me with the source code and any relevant information about the code, such as the programming language and any specific compilation options that were used.
