I am an expert in high-performance computation and decompilation. I can decompile the provided IR code into equivalent C or C++ source code.

The decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code is as follows:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int add(vector<int> &v) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
        sum += v[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
```
The decompiled code is in C++ and it defines a function called `add` that takes a vector of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all the elements in the vector.

It's worth noting that the decompiled code is not the original source code, but it is functionally equivalent to the original code. The decompiled code is a faithful representation of the original code, but it may not be identical to the original source code.
