The provided IR code is for a function that takes an integer as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be a simple implementation of the FizzBuzz algorithm, which is a popular coding challenge that involves printing the numbers from 1 to 100, with the following rules:

* For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
* For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
* For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

The IR code is written in LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), which is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program. The code is not in a human-readable format, but it can be decompiled into equivalent C or C++ source code using a decompiler.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code:
```
int fizz_buzz(int n) {
  int result = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
      result += 1;
    } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
      result += 2;
    } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
      result += 3;
    } else {
      result += 4;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```
The decompiled code is a simple implementation of the FizzBuzz algorithm, with a few minor differences from the original code. The main difference is that the decompiled code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n`, whereas the original code uses a `while` loop. Additionally, the decompiled code uses a `switch` statement to determine the output for each number, whereas the original code uses a series of `if` statements.

Overall, the decompiled code is functionally equivalent to the original code, but it may not be identical in terms of performance or readability.
