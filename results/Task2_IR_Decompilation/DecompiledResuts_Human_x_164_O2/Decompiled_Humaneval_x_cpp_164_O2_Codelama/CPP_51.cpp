Sure, I can help you with that. The provided IR code is for a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string has correct bracketing.

Here's the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool correct_bracketing(string brackets) {
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < brackets.length(); i++) {
        if (brackets[i] == '(') {
            level += 1;
        } else if (brackets[i] == ')') {
            level -= 1;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    if (level != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
The function iterates through the input string and keeps track of the nesting level of the brackets. If the nesting level becomes negative at any point, it means that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, and the function returns false. If the nesting level is non-zero at the end of the string, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, and the function also returns false. Otherwise, the function returns true.
