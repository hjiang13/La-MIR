I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is not in a standard format, and it appears to be missing important information such as the function signature and the data types of the variables.

If you could provide me with the IR code in a standard format, such as the LLVM IR format, I would be happy to try and decompile it for you.
