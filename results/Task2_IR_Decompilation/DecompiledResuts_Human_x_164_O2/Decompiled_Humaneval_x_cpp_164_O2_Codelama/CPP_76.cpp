The provided IR code is a function named `_Z15is_simple_powerii` that takes two 32-bit integer arguments and returns a 1-bit integer value. The function appears to be a simple loop that checks whether the first argument is a power of the second argument.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the function:
```
bool _Z15is_simple_powerii(int x, int y) {
    if (x <= 0 || y <= 0) {
        return false;
    }
    int i = 0;
    while (i < x) {
        if (y == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        y *= x;
        i++;
    }
    return false;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code may not be exactly the same as the original source code, as the IR code may have been optimized or transformed in various ways. However, the decompiled code should be functionally equivalent to the original code.
