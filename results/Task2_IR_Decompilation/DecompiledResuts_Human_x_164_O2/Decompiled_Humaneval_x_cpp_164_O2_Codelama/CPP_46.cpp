The provided IR code is a function named `_Z4fib4i` that takes an integer argument and returns an integer value. The function appears to be a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, with the first four values (0, 1, 1, and 2) hardcoded.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int fib(int n) {
  if (n <= 3) {
    return n;
  } else {
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
  }
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly equivalent to the original assembly code, as the decompiler has made some assumptions about the behavior of the code based on the patterns it has observed. However, the decompiled code should be functionally equivalent to the original code, and can be used as a starting point for further reverse engineering or analysis.
