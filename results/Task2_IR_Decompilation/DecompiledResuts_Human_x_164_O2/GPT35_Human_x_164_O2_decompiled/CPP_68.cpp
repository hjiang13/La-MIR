It is not possible to directly convert LLVM IR code into C or C++ source code as LLVM IR is a low-level intermediate representation while C/C++ are high-level programming languages. Decompiling LLVM IR code back to C or C++ source code is a complex and error-prone process that often requires manual intervention and interpretation of the original code's logic and structure.

If you have a specific function or logic in the LLVM IR code that you would like to convert to C or C++ code, please provide that information so that I can help you with the conversion.
