Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the function does.

Looking at the function definition, it's named @_Z17is_multiply_primei and takes an i32 argument. The C++ name suggests it's a function called is_multiply_prime with an int parameter.

The function starts by checking if the input is less than 4. If so, it jumps to label 11. Otherwise, it proceeds to label 3.

In label 3, there are phi nodes indicating loops. Phi nodes in LLVM IR represent the merging of values from different control flow paths. So, it seems like there's a loop structure here, probably a while loop.

The function computes the remainder of %6 divided by %4. Then it checks if this remainder is zero and if %6 is greater than %4. If both conditions are true, it branches to label 14; otherwise, it goes to label 23.

Label 14 has more phi nodes and seems to be part of a loop where it's dividing and incrementing variables. It checks if the remainder of division by %4 is zero and if the quotient is greater than %4. If so, it loops back to label 14; otherwise, it moves to label 23.

Label 23 updates some variables and then checks if the square of the incremented %4 is greater than %24. If true, it branches back to label 11; otherwise, it loops back to label 3.

Label 11 checks if a certain value is equal to 2. If so, it returns true; otherwise, false.

Putting this together, it looks like the function is checking if a number has any divisors other than 1 and itself, which is the definition of a prime number. So, it's a primality test.

Wait, but the function's name is is_multiply_prime, which might indicate it's checking for multiplicative primes, but in number theory, primes are multiplicative primes. So, it's likely just a prime check function.

Now, translating this into C++. The function takes an integer and returns a bool. The IR code seems to implement a trial division method up to sqrt(n) to check for factors.

The initial check if n < 4: if n is less than 4, it returns whether n is 2. For numbers less than 4, only 2 is prime.

For other numbers, the function uses a loop starting from 2 up to sqrt(n), checking if any number divides n. If any do, it returns false; otherwise, returns true.

So, the C++ function would look something like this:

bool is_multiply_prime(int n) {
    if (n < 4) {
        return n == 2;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, but in the IR code, the loop structure is a bit more involved. Let me see: the loop increments i, checks if i divides n, then if n/i is greater than i, continues. That's a standard trial division up to sqrt(n).

So, the C++ code should correctly implement this logic.

The given LLVM IR code implements a function `is_multiply_prime` that checks if a given integer is a prime number using trial division up to the square root of the number. Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

bool is_multiply_prime(int n) {
    if (n < 4) {
        return n == 2;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= std::sqrt(n); ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initial Check:** The function first checks if the input `n` is less than 4. Since 2 is the only prime number less than 4, it returns `true` if `n` is 2 and `false` otherwise.

2. **Loop for Trial Division:** For numbers 4 and greater, the function iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n`. For each `i`, it checks if `i` divides `n` without a remainder.

3. **Prime Check:** If any `i` divides `n`, the function returns `false` as `n` is not prime. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, it returns `true`, indicating `n` is prime.

This code can be directly compiled and run in a C++ environment to test for prime numbers.
