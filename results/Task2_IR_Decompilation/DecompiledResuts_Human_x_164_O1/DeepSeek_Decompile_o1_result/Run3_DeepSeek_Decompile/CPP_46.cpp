Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

First, I'll look at the function definition. The function is named @_Z4fib4i, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find that it translates to "fib(int)". So the function is called fib and takes an integer as an argument.

Looking at the IR code, I see that it starts by allocating space for a [100 x i32] array. That's an array of 100 integers. It then uses bitcast to convert the array pointer to an i8* so it can call llvm.lifetime.start and end. I remember that these functions are used for memory management, marking the start and end of the lifetime of an allocation.

Next, there are a series of store instructions initializing the first few elements of the array. The indices 0, 1, 2, and 3 are being set to 0, 0, 2, and 0 respectively. So the array starts with [0, 0, 2, 0, ...]. That looks like the starting points for a Fibonacci sequence, but it's a bit different from the usual 1, 1, 2, 3, etc.

Then there's an icmp (integer comparison) to check if the input %0 (which is the argument) is less than 4. If it is, it branches to label 14, otherwise to label 9. So for n < 4, it returns the stored value directly.

If n is 4 or more, it enters a loop. The loop seems to be calculating Fibonacci numbers iteratively. It uses a phi node to track the current and previous values. The loop increments n, loading values from the array, adding them, and storing the result back into the array.

The loop continues until it reaches the desired n. Once done, it calls llvm.lifetime.end and returns the result.

Putting this together, the function initializes an array, handles base cases, and then iteratively computes Fibonacci numbers for n >=4. It uses an array to store intermediate values, which might be for memoization or just to avoid recursion.

I think the C++ code should declare an array of 100 integers, initialize the first four, and then loop from 4 up to n, calculating each Fibonacci number and storing it. Finally, it returns the nth value.

I need to make sure the loop starts correctly, initializes the variables properly, and uses the array to store each step. Also, since the function is declared as returning an int and takes an int argument, the C++ code should match that.

Wait, in the IR, the array is allocated on the stack with alloca, so in C++, it should be a local array. The function uses the array to store Fibonacci numbers up to index n, which is why it's size 100, probably assuming n won't exceed 99.

I should write a function that initializes the array, handles the base cases, and then loops to compute higher values. The loop in C++ would start from 4 up to n, calculating each fib[i] as the sum of the previous two.

I think I have the structure down. Now, I'll write the C++ code that matches this logic.

The provided LLVM IR code corresponds to a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number iteratively, utilizing an array to store intermediate results. Here's the decompiled C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    int fibArray[100];
    fibArray[0] = 0;
    fibArray[1] = 0;
    fibArray[2] = 2;
    fibArray[3] = 0;

    if (n < 4) {
        return fibArray[n];
    }

    for (int i = 4; i <= n; ++i) {
        fibArray[i] = fibArray[i-1] + fibArray[i-2];
    }

    return fibArray[n];
}

int main() {
    int result = fib(10); // Example usage
    cout << "Fibonacci number: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Array Initialization:** The function initializes an array `fibArray` of size 100 to store Fibonacci numbers.
- **Base Cases:** The first four elements are set to 0, 0, 2, and 0, respectively.
- **Direct Return for Small n:** If `n` is less than 4, the function returns the precomputed value directly from the array.
- **Iterative Calculation:** For `n` >= 4, the function iterates from 4 to `n`, calculating each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding numbers and storing the result in the array.
- **Return Result:** Finally, the function returns the nth Fibonacci number.

This approach efficiently computes the Fibonacci number using an iterative method with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity (excluding the array), making it suitable for large values of `n` up to 99.
