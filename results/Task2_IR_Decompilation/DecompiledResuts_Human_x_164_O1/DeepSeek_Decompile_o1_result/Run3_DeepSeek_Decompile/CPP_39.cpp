Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code that can be run directly. Let me start by looking at the IR code provided.

The function is named @_Z9prime_fibi, which I think is a C++ mangled name. Using a demangler, I find that it corresponds to a function called prime_fibi with an integer parameter. So the function signature in C++ should be something like int prime_fibi(int).

Looking at the IR, the function starts with a label 2, which seems to be the entry point. There are several phi nodes, which suggests that this is a loop. The variables involved are %3, %4, %5, and %6. 

I notice that %3 and %4 are being updated in each iteration. %3 starts with 1, and %4 starts with 2. This makes me think they are tracking Fibonacci numbers. %6 is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 each loop iteration, likely counting the number of Fibonacci numbers generated.

The loop condition is checking if %6 is less than the input %0. So the loop runs until the count reaches the input value. Inside the loop, there's a check if %4 is less than 4 or if %4 is even (since it's checking the least significant bit). If either is true, it continues the loop, otherwise it enters a nested loop.

In the nested loop, %14 starts at 3 and increments by 1 each time. It calculates %14 squared and compares it to %4. If %14 squared exceeds %4, it breaks out of the loop, otherwise it checks if %4 is divisible by %14. If it is, the loop breaks; if not, it continues.

After the nested loop, it updates %26, which seems to be selecting whether to set it to %4 or keep it as %5 based on whether the count has reached the input. Once the count matches the input, it returns %26.

Putting this together, the function appears to generate Fibonacci numbers until the nth term, where n is the input. For each Fibonacci number, it checks for primality by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. If a Fibonacci number is prime, it's selected as the result.

So, the C++ code should implement this logic. It initializes the first two Fibonacci numbers, iterates up to n, and for each Fibonacci number, checks if it's prime. The function returns the nth prime Fibonacci number.

I should write this in C++, making sure to handle the loop correctly, check for primality, and return the appropriate value.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the logic and structure of the IR code and translate it into equivalent C++ syntax. Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `@_Z9prime_fibi` is a C++ mangled name that translates to `prime_fibi` function taking an integer parameter and returning an integer.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes variables to track the Fibonacci sequence and a counter.

3. **Main Loop**: It loops until the counter reaches the input value. In each iteration, it checks if the current Fibonacci number is prime.

4. **Primality Check**: For each Fibonacci number, it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number to determine if it's prime.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the nth prime Fibonacci number.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int prime_fibi(int n) {
    int a = 1, b = 2, c, x = 0, y;
    int count = 0;
    while (true) {
        if (count >= n) break;
        y = 1;
        for (int z = 3; z * z <= b; z += 2) {
            if (b % z == 0) {
                y = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (y && (b % 2 != 0 || b < 4)) {
            count++;
            if (count == n) return b;
        }
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << prime_fibi(1) << std::endl; // Example usage
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the `prime_fibi` function which calculates the nth prime Fibonacci number and includes a `main` function for example usage.
