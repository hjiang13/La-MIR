Okay, I need to figure out how to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code is doing.

Looking at the function `@_Z10choose_numii`, which seems to be `choose_num(int, int)` in C++. The function takes two integers as arguments. 

The function starts with an `icmp slt` instruction, which compares if the second argument `%1` is less than the first `%0`. If true, it branches to label 12, otherwise continues.

At label 4, it checks if `%1` is equal to `%0` with `icmp eq`. Then it computes the remainder of `%1` divided by 2 using `srem`, and checks if this remainder is 1. It then uses `and` to see if both the equality condition and the remainder being 1 are true. If so, it branches to label 12; otherwise, it goes to label 9.

At label 9, it sign-extends the remainder result to an integer and adds it to `%1`, then branches to label 12.

Label 12 is where the return value is determined using a `phi` instruction, which selects the return value based on which branch was taken. The possible return values are -1 or the result of the addition.

So, putting this together, the function seems to return -1 if certain conditions aren't met, else it returns `%1 + 1` if the remainder is 1. 

I think the function is trying to return `-1` if the second number isn't less than the first or if it's even. Otherwise, it returns the second number plus one. So, in C++, this would involve conditional checks and returns based on those conditions.

I should structure the C++ function to mirror these conditions: first check if `b < a`, then if `b == a`, and check if `b` is odd. Depending on these, return either `-1` or `b + 1`. If none of the conditions are met, it returns `-1`.

I should also make sure the function handles all possible cases correctly, ensuring that the logic aligns with the IR's behavior.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we analyze the function's behavior and translate it into equivalent C++ logic.

The function `choose_num` takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns an integer based on specific conditions. Here's the breakdown:

1. If `b` is less than `a`, return `-1`.
2. If `b` equals `a`, check if `b` is odd:
   - If `b` is odd, return `b + 1`.
   - Otherwise, return `-1`.
3. If neither condition is met, return `-1`.

Here's the C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (b == a) {
        if (b % 2 == 1) {
            return b + 1;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << choose_num(5, 3) << std::endl;  // Output: -1
    std::cout << choose_num(4, 4) << std::endl;  // Output: 5
    std::cout << choose_num(4, 5) << std::endl;  // Output: -1
    return 0;
}
```

This code can be saved to a `.cpp` file and compiled with a C++ compiler to execute the example cases.
