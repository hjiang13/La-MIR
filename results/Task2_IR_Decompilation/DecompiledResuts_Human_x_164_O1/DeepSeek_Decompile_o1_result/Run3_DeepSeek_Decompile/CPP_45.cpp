Alright, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C or C++ source code. Let's start by looking at the IR code provided. 

First, I see that the module is named after a C++ file, so it's likely C++ code. The function defined is `_Z13triangle_areaff`, which is a mangled name. I'll need to demangle it to understand what it represents. 

Using a C++ name demangler, `_Z13triangle_areaff` translates to `triangle_area(float, float)`. So, the function takes two floats and returns a float. 

Looking at the function's body, the IR code does the following:
1. It multiplies the two input floats (`%0` and `%1`) and stores the result in `%3`.
2. Then, it multiplies `%3` by 0.5 and stores the result in `%4`.
3. Finally, it returns `%4`.

This sequence suggests the function is calculating the area of a triangle using the formula: (base * height) / 2, which simplifies to base * height * 0.5. 

Putting this together, the C++ function should take two floats, multiply them, then multiply by 0.5, and return the result. 

I should write the function with the correct signature and include the calculation. Also, since it's a standalone function, I'll make sure it's properly declared and defined so it can be compiled and run without issues.

The given LLVM IR code represents a simple function that calculates the area of a triangle. The function takes two `float` arguments, multiplies them together, and then multiplies the result by 0.5. Here's the equivalent C++ source code:

```cpp
float triangle_area(float base, float height) {
    return base * height * 0.5f;
}
```

This code can be saved to a .cpp file and compiled with a C++ compiler to produce an executable. The function `triangle_area` calculates the area using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (base Ã— height) / 2.
