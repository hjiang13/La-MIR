Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's start by carefully examining the IR code provided.

The IR defines a function named @_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni, which takes an i32 parameter and returns an i1. The function has several attributes indicating it's a leaf function with no side effects, which is good because it means the function is self-contained and easier to translate.

Looking at the function body, the first instruction is %2 = and i32 %0, 1. This is taking the input integer and applying a bitwise AND with 1, which effectively checks if the least significant bit is set. The result is stored in %2.

Next, %3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0. This compares %2 with 0, which means it's checking whether the result of the AND operation was zero. So, %3 will be true (1) if the input is even because the last bit is 0 for even numbers.

Then, %4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7. This checks if the input is greater than 7. The 'sgt' stands for signed greater than, so it's checking if the number is more than 7.

The next instruction is %5 = and i1 %4, %3. This takes the two boolean results from %3 and %4 and performs a logical AND. So, %5 will be true only if the input is both even and greater than 7.

Finally, the function returns %5 as an i1, which is a boolean value indicating whether both conditions are met.

Putting this together, the function is checking if the input integer is even and greater than 7. If both conditions are true, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

To translate this into C++, the function would take an int as an argument and return a bool. The implementation would involve the same checks: first determine if the number is even, then check if it's greater than 7, and return the logical AND of these two conditions.

I also notice the IR's function name uses a specific naming convention, likely C++ name mangling. The original function might have been named is_equal_to_sum_even, taking an int and returning a bool.

So, the C++ function should look like this:

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int x) {
    return (x > 7) && (x % 2 == 0);
}

Alternatively, since checking the least significant bit is more efficient, it could be written as:

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int x) {
    return x > 7 && (x & 1) == 0;
}

This should accurately reflect the logic in the IR code.
</think>

To decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we analyze the function's operations and translate them into equivalent C++ statements. The function checks if the input integer is both even and greater than 7.

**Decompiled C++ Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int x) {
    return x > 7 && (x & 1) == 0;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << is_equal_to_sum_even(8) << std::endl;  // Should output: true
    std::cout << is_equal_to_sum_even(9) << std::endl;  // Should output: false
    std::cout << is_equal_to_sum_even(7) << std::endl;  // Should output: false
    std::cout << is_equal_to_sum_even(10) << std::endl; // Should output: true
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer `x`.
- It checks if `x` is greater than 7.
- It checks if `x` is even using a bitwise AND operation (`x & 1`).
- It returns `true` only if both conditions are met; otherwise, it returns `false`.
- The `main` function demonstrates example usage with test cases.

You can compile and run this code to test the functionality.
