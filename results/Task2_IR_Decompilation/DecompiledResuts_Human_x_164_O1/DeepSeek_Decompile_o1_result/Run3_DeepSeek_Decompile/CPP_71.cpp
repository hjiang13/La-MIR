Alright, I'm trying to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with the function definition: `define dso_local float @_Z13triangle_areafff(float %0, float %1, float %2)`. From the mangling, I can tell this is a function called `triangle_area` that takes three floats and returns a float.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by adding the first two arguments: `%4 = fadd float %0, %1`. Then it compares `%4` with `%2` using `fcmp ugt`, which checks if `%4` is greater than `%2`. This gives a boolean result in `%5`. Similarly, it adds `%0` and `%2` and compares with `%1` in `%7`. The `and` of `%5` and `%7` is stored in `%8`.

Next, it adds `%1` and `%2`, compares with `%0`, and stores the result in `%10`. The `select` instruction chooses between `%10` and `false` based on `%8`, resulting in `%11`. This determines the branch direction.

If `%11` is true, the code proceeds to calculate the area. It adds `%4` and `%2` into `%13`, multiplies by 0.5 to get `%14`, then subtracts `%0` to get `%15`. It multiplies `%14` by `%15` into `%16`. Then, subtracts `%1` from `%14` to get `%17`, multiplies by `%16` for `%18`, subtracts `%2` from `%14` for `%19`, multiplies by `%18` for `%20`. This value is extended to double, and `pow` is called with 0.5, then truncated back to float as `%23`.

If `%11` is false, the function returns -1.0. So, putting it all together, the function calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula when the sides satisfy the triangle inequality, otherwise returns -1.0.

I need to translate this logic into C++. The IR seems to handle the condition where the sum of any two sides is greater than the third. So, the C++ function should check this condition, compute the semi-perimeter, and then apply the square root of `s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)` for the area. If the condition isn't met, return -1.0f.

I should also handle the floating-point operations correctly, ensuring that the calculations are done in the right order to maintain precision. Finally, the function should return the computed area or -1.0f if the sides don't form a valid triangle.

The given LLVM IR code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula. Here's the decompiled C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

float triangle_area(float a, float b, float c) {
    if ((a + b > c) && (a + c > b) && (b + c > a)) {
        float s = (a + b + c) * 0.5f;
        float area_squared = s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c);
        return sqrt(area_squared);
    } else {
        return -1.0f;
    }
}
```

This function first checks if the sides `a`, `b`, and `c` form a valid triangle. If they do, it computes the area using Heron's formula. Otherwise, it returns `-1.0f`.
