Okay, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++. Let me take it step by step.

First, I see the function is named @_Z9fizz_buzzi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using demangling tools, I find it translates to "fizz_buzz". So the function is probably implementing FizzBuzz logic.

Looking at the IR, the function takes an i32 parameter %0, which is the number. The function returns an i32, likely 0 if it's not FizzBuzz, or some encoded value if it is.

The function starts with an icmp sgt (greater than) on %0 and 0. If true, it branches to label 5, else label 3.

At label 3, there's a phi node for %4, which starts at 0 and accumulates. It returns %4, which starts as 0, so if the input is <=0, returns 0.

Label 5 has two phi nodes, %6 and %7, initialized to 0. Then it computes %6 modulo 11 and 13. If either is 0, it sets %12. It checks if %6 is not 0, and if either modulo condition is met, it branches to label 15.

In label 15, there's another loop. It extracts the last digit with srem %16,10 and checks if it's 7. If so, adds 1 to %17. Then it divides %16 by 10 and loops if it's greater than 9.

Label 24 accumulates the count and increments %6. It loops until %26 equals %0.

Putting it all together, the function counts numbers up to n divisible by 11 or 13, and whose last digit is 7. It returns the count.

So the C++ code should implement this logic.

The task is to decompile the provided LLVM IR code into readable C++ source code. Here's the step-by-step explanation and the final C++ code:

### Decompilation Explanation:
1. **Function Name**: The mangled function name `@_Z9fizz_buzzi` translates to `fizz_buzz`, suggesting a FizzBuzz-like function.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function takes an integer `n` and returns another integer.
   - It checks divisibility by 11 and 13, and counts numbers up to `n` that meet these conditions.
   - Additionally, it checks if the last digit is 7.

3. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, checking each number against the conditions.
   - If a number meets the criteria, a counter is incremented.

### Decompiled C++ Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fizz_buzz(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0) {
            bool ends_with_7 = false;
            int num = i;
            while (num > 9) {
                num /= 10;
            }
            if (num == 7) {
                ends_with_7 = true;
            }
            if (ends_with_7) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << fizz_buzz(100) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Function `fizz_buzz`**: Counts numbers up to `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13 and end with the digit 7.
- **Main Function**: Example usage, prints the result for `n = 100`.

### Usage:
- Save the code to a `.cpp` file.
- Compile with `g++`: `g++ -o fizzbuzz fizzbuzz.cpp`
- Run: `./fizzbuzz`

This code should provide the same functionality as the original LLVM IR.
