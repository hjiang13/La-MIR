Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by looking at the IR code provided.

The function is named @_Z3fibi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find that it corresponds to int fib(int). So the function takes an integer and returns an integer.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by allocating a block of memory for an array of 1000 integers. The alloca instruction allocates this on the stack. The bitcast converts this array to an i8* pointer, which is needed for the lifetime intrinsics.

Then it calls llvm.lifetime.start to mark the beginning of the array's lifetime. It initializes the first two elements of the array to 0 and 1, which makes sense for a Fibonacci sequence.

Next, there's an icmp instruction checking if the input is less than 2. If so, it branches to label 12, which loads the corresponding value from the array and returns it. Otherwise, it goes to label 7.

In label 7, it increments the input by 1, converts it to i64, and loads the second element of the array. Then it jumps to label 16.

Label 16 seems to be a loop. It uses phi nodes to handle values from different branches. The loop calculates each Fibonacci number by adding the previous two, stores the result back into the array, and increments the index. It continues until the index reaches the input value plus one.

The loop uses getelementptr to access array elements and stores the computed Fibonacci number. Once the loop finishes, it exits to label 12, which retrieves the result from the array and returns it.

I need to translate this into C++. The array is allocated on the stack as an int array of size 1000. The initial conditions are set for fib(0) and fib(1). For n >= 2, a loop runs from 2 to n, computing each fib(i) as the sum of the previous two, storing each result in the array. Finally, the function returns the nth Fibonacci number.

I should write the C++ code with these steps: declare the array, handle base cases, loop for larger values, and return the result. Make sure the array is properly scoped and initialized.

Wait, in the IR, the loop starts at label 7, but in C++, the loop should start from 2 up to n. Also, the IR uses a phi node to track the current value and the index, which in C++ can be handled with a for loop.

I think the C++ code should look something like this:

int fib(int n) {
    int arr[1000];
    arr[0] = 0;
    arr[1] = 1;
    if (n < 2) return arr[n];
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2];
    }
    return arr[n];
}

That should replicate the behavior of the IR code.

The provided LLVM IR code is for a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using an array to store intermediate values. Here's the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fib(int n) {
    int arr[1000];
    arr[0] = 0;
    arr[1] = 1;
    
    if (n < 2) {
        return arr[n];
    }
    
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + arr[i - 2];
    }
    
    return arr[n];
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Fibonacci number: " << fib(10) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `fib` initializes an array to store Fibonacci numbers.
- It handles base cases where `n` is 0 or 1 directly.
- For larger `n`, it iterates from 2 to `n`, computing each Fibonacci number and storing it in the array.
- The result is returned from the array.

You can compile and run this code to compute Fibonacci numbers.
