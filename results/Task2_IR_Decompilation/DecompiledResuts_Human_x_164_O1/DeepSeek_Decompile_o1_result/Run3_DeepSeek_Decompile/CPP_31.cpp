Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user provided some LLVM IR code and wants me to decompile it back into C or C++ that can be run directly. I'm not super familiar with LLVM IR, but I know it's an intermediate representation used by compilers like Clang and GCC.

First, I'll look at the provided IR code. The function is named @_Z8is_primex(i64 %0), which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find that it translates to "is_prime" taking an int64. That makes sense since the function returns a boolean (i1).

Looking at the code structure, it starts with some checks. The first line, %2 = icmp slt i64 %0, 2, compares if the input is less than 2. If so, it branches to label 16, which seems to be the exit point returning false. That aligns with the basic prime check where numbers less than 2 aren't prime.

Next, at label 3, it checks if the input is less than 4. Then it checks if the number is even using %5 = and i64 %0, 1 and %6 = icmp eq i64 %5, 0. If either the number is less than 4 or even, it branches to label 16. So, numbers like 2 and 3 would pass here, returning true.

The more complex part is the loop starting at label 8. It initializes %9 as 3 and then enters a loop where it multiplies %9 by itself and checks if it exceeds the input. If it does, the number is prime, so it returns true. Otherwise, it checks if the input is divisible by %9 (using srem), and if so, returns false. If not, it increments %9 by 1 and continues the loop.

I notice that the loop uses phi nodes to handle the iteration, which is a way in SSA form to represent variables that are updated each iteration. The loop continues until the square of %9 exceeds the input, which is a standard optimization for prime checking.

Putting this all together, the function first handles small cases, then checks for evenness, and finally uses trial division up to the square root of the number. This seems efficient for small to moderate numbers.

Now, to translate this into C++. The function will take an int64 (which is a long long in C++) and return a bool. The initial checks are straightforward: if the number is less than 2, return false. If it's 2 or 3, return true. If it's even, return false.

For the loop, I'll start checking divisors from 3 upwards, incrementing by 2 each time to skip even numbers. I'll loop while the square of the current divisor is less than or equal to the number. If any divisor divides the number evenly, it's not prime. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the number is prime.

I should also consider the sign of the input. Since the function returns false for negative numbers, I'll add a check at the beginning.

Testing the function with some examples would help ensure correctness. For instance, is_prime(2) should return true, is_prime(4) should return false, is_prime(15) should return false, and so on.

Finally, I'll write the C++ code incorporating all these steps, making sure it's clean and efficient, avoiding unnecessary computations.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code to C++ source code, we can analyze the code and translate it back to a high-level language. Based on the IR code, this appears to be an implementation of a function that checks whether a number is prime.

Here's the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_prime(int64_t number) {
    if (number < 2) {
        return false;
    }
    if (number < 4) {
        return true;
    }
    if (number % 2 == 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    for (int64_t i = 3; i * i <= number; i += 2) {
        if (number % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << is_prime(2) << std::endl;    // true
    std::cout << is_prime(4) << std::endl;    // false
    std::cout << is_prime(15) << std::endl;   // false
    std::cout << is_prime(17) << std::endl;   // true
    std::cout << is_prime(-5) << std::endl;   // false
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
The code defines a function `is_prime` that checks whether a given number is prime. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the number is less than 2, it's not prime.
   - If the number is less than 4, it's prime (since 2 and 3 are primes).
   - If the number is even and greater than 2, it's not prime.

2. **Loop to Check Divisors**:
   - The loop starts at 3 and checks only odd numbers (increment by 2).
   - For each number `i`, it checks if `i * i` is greater than the input number. If so, the number is prime.
   - If the number is divisible by any `i` in this range, it's not prime.

3. **Return Result**:
   - The function returns `true` if the number is prime and `false` otherwise.

This implementation efficiently checks for primality by:
- Skipping even numbers
- Only checking divisors up to the square root of the number
- Quickly eliminating small cases and even numbers

You can compile and run this code directly in a C++ environment.
