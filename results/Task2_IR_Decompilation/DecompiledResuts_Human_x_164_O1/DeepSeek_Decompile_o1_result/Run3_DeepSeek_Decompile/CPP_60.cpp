Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code, and I need to decompile it back into C or C++ source code that I can run directly. Let me start by looking at the code provided.

The IR code defines a function named @_Z8sum_to_ni which takes an i32 argument. The function has several attributes like mustprogress, nofree, etc. The body of the function does some arithmetic operations. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the function takes an integer %0 as input. Then, it calculates %2 by adding 1 to %0. So, %2 = %0 + 1. Next, it multiplies %2 by %0 and stores the result in %3. So, %3 = %2 * %0. After that, it divides %3 by 2 using signed division and stores it in %4. Finally, it returns %4.

Wait, so putting this together, the function is calculating (0 + 1) * 0, then dividing by 2? That doesn't sound right. Oh, wait, no, %0 is the input parameter. So it's (n + 1) * n / 2. Oh, right! That's the formula for the sum of the first n integers. So sum = n*(n+1)/2.

So the function is sum_to_n, which takes an integer n and returns the sum from 1 to n. Now, I need to write a C++ function that does this.

Looking at the function name @_Z8sum_to_ni, the Z8 suggests it's a mangled name. Let me see, in C++ name mangling, the prefix is usually _Z followed by the number of characters in the function name. So _Z8sum_to_ni would correspond to a function named sum_to_n with i as the suffix, which typically denotes an int parameter. So the function is likely declared as int sum_to_n(int).

In the IR code, the function returns an i32, which is a 32-bit integer, so the return type is int. The parameter is also i32, so it's an int.

Putting this together, the C++ function would be something like:

int sum_to_n(int n) {
    return (n + 1) * n / 2;
}

Wait, but in the IR, the operations are done as add, mul, then div. So the order is (n+1) multiplied by n, then divided by 2. That's the same as n*(n+1)/2, which is correct.

So the function is straightforward. Now, I need to make sure that the C++ code matches this behavior. Since the function is simple, there shouldn't be any issues with signed vs. unsigned, but the IR uses 'nsw' which stands for 'no signed wrap', meaning that the operations don't wrap around in a way that would cause undefined behavior in C++. So the function should handle all integer values correctly within the range.

I should also consider whether to use int or a different type, but since the IR uses i32, int is appropriate. Also, the function is marked as readnone, which suggests it has no side effects, so the C++ function should be pure.

Therefore, the decompiled function should look like the code I wrote above. I can test it by compiling it and running it to ensure it produces the same results as the IR code.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we analyze the arithmetic operations performed and translate them into a function.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Function Signature:**
   - The function is named `@_Z8sum_to_ni`, which when demangled corresponds to `sum_to_n` taking an `int` parameter.

2. **Analyze the Arithmetic Operations:**
   - `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1` → `int %2 = %0 + 1;`
   - `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0` → `int %3 = %2 * %0;`
   - `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2` → `int %4 = %3 / 2;`
   - `ret i32 %4` → `return %4;`

3. **Combine Operations:**
   - The operations compute `(n + 1) * n / 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` integers.

**Decompiled C++ Code:**

```cpp
int sum_to_n(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```
