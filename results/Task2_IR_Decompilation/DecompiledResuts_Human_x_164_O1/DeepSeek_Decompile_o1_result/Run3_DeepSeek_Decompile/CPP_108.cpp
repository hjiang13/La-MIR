Okay, so I've got this LLVM IR code, and I need to decompile it back into C++ source code that I can run directly. Let's see how to approach this.

First, I'll look through the IR code to understand what it's doing. The function is called _Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE, which when demangled probably translates to count_nums(std::vector<int>). So the function takes a vector of integers and returns an integer.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by getting elements from the vector. It's accessing the data, size, and capacity, I think. It loads the size and data pointers into variables. Then it calculates the size by subtracting the data pointer from the end pointer and checks if the size is zero. If it is, it returns 0.

If the size isn't zero, it does some bitwise operations, maybe to calculate half the size or something. Then it enters a loop where it's iterating through each element of the vector. For each element, it checks if it's greater than 0. If it is, it adds 1 to the count. If not, it takes the absolute value and checks if it's greater than 9. If it is, it processes each digit of the number by repeatedly dividing and taking the remainder to sum the digits.

Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the function seems to be counting numbers that meet a certain condition, possibly related to their digits. So for numbers greater than 0, it increments the count. For non-positive numbers, it takes the absolute value and if it's greater than 9, it breaks down each digit and does something with them, maybe checking if the sum of digits is greater than the number of digits minus one.

I need to map this logic into C++. So the function will loop through each number in the vector. For each number, if it's positive, increment the count. If it's zero or negative, take the absolute value. If it's a two-digit number or more, then for each digit, sum them up. If the sum of digits is greater than the number of digits minus one, then increment the count.

Wait, looking at the code, after processing the digits, there's a comparison between the sum of digits and the number of digits minus one. If the sum is greater, then it counts it. So the condition is that the sum of the digits is greater than (number of digits - 1). That would mean for a two-digit number, the sum should be greater than 1, which is true for any number where the digits add up to more than 1. For a three-digit number, the sum should be greater than 2, and so on.

Putting it all together, the function is counting how many numbers in the vector meet this digit sum condition, considering positive numbers as automatically counting and evaluating non-positive numbers based on their digits.

So, the C++ code would have a loop over the vector elements, applying this logic. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to handle positive and non-positive cases, and within the non-positive cases, check if the absolute value meets the digit sum condition.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib> // for std::abs

using namespace std;

int count_nums(vector<int> vec) {
    int count = 0;
    int size = vec.size();
    if (size == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    int half_size = (size >> 1) | ((size & 1) != 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < half_size; ++i) {
        int num = vec[i];
        if (num > 0) {
            count++;
        } else {
            num = abs(num);
            if (num > 9) {
                int sum = 0;
                int temp = num;
                int digit_count = 0;
                while (temp != 0) {
                    sum += temp % 10;
                    temp = temp / 10;
                    digit_count++;
                }
                if (sum > (digit_count - 1)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

This code includes the necessary headers and uses the standard namespace. It defines a function `count_nums` that takes a vector of integers and returns an integer count. The function first checks if the vector is empty and returns 0 if so. It then calculates half the size of the vector and iterates over each element. For each number, it checks if it's positive and increments the count if true. For non-positive numbers, it takes the absolute value and checks if it's a multi-digit number. If so, it calculates the sum of the digits and compares it to the number of digits minus one, incrementing the count if the sum is greater. The loop runs for half the size, and the logic is structured to handle each element as per the conditions described.
