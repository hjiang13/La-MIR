Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to decompile some LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. The user provided the IR, which is a function named `_Z11sum_productSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`. My goal is to understand what this function does and then write the equivalent C++ code.

First, I notice that the function has a mangled name. Using a C++ name demangler, I find that `_Z11sum_productSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` translates to `sum_product(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int>>)`. So the function takes a vector of integers by value and returns a vector of integers.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by accessing elements of the input vector. It loads the begin, end, and size pointers from the vector. Then it calculates the size by subtracting the begin pointer from the end pointer. If the size is zero, it branches to block 14; otherwise, it proceeds to block 11.

In block 11, it calculates half the size and ensures it's at least 1 using `llvm.umax.i64`. Then it enters a loop in block 36. This loop seems to iterate over the vector, loading each element, and accumulating a sum and product.

The loop in block 36 increments the index, loads the current element, adds it to the sum, multiplies it to the product, and checks if it has reached the end. Once the loop finishes, it branches back to block 14.

In block 14, it constructs a new vector to hold the results. It initializes the new vector's memory using `memset`, allocates space using `new`, and sets up the vector's internal pointers. Then it stores the sum and product into the new vector and returns.

Putting this together, the function creates a new vector where the first element is the sum of the input vector's elements and the second element is the product. It handles empty vectors by returning a default-constructed vector, which would have a size of zero.

I need to make sure the C++ code correctly initializes the result vector, handles empty input, and properly computes the sum and product. I'll structure the code to loop through each element, accumulate the sum and product, and then construct the result vector accordingly.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code that corresponds to the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> sum_product(const vector<int>& input) {
    const int* data = input.data();
    size_t size = input.size();

    if (size == 0) {
        return vector<int>();
    }

    size_t half_size = size >> 1;
    half_size = half_size < 1 ? 1 : half_size;

    int sum = 0;
    int product = 1;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < half_size; ++i) {
        sum += data[i];
        product *= data[i];
    }

    vector<int> result(2);
    result[0] = sum;
    result[1] = product;
    return result;
}
```

This code:
1. Takes a `const vector<int>&` as input
2. Calculates the sum of the first half of the vector's elements
3. Calculates the product of the first half of the vector's elements
4. Returns a new vector containing the sum as the first element and the product as the second element

You can use this function like:
```cpp
int main() {
    vector<int> input = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    vector<int> result = sum_product(input);
    // result[0] will be 1+2=3, result[1] will be 1*2=2
    return 0;
}
```

The code handles empty input vectors by returning an empty vector.
