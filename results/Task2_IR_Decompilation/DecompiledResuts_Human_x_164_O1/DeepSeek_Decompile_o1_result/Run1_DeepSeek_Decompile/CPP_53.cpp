Okay, so I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C or C++ source code that I can run directly. Let's start by looking at the IR code provided.

The IR starts with the ModuleID and source_filename, which tells me it's from a file called CPP_53.cpp. The target is x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, so it's compiled for a 64-bit Linux system.

Looking at the function definition: define dso_local i32 @_Z3addii(i32 %0, i32 %1) local_unnamed_addr #0. The function name is _Z3addii, which looks like a mangled C++ name. Using the C++ name demangling tool, _Z3addii becomes "addi". Wait, that doesn't make sense because "add" is more likely. Maybe it's _Z3addii, which is "add" with two integers. So the function takes two i32 parameters and returns an i32.

Inside the function, there's a single instruction: %3 = add nsw i32 %1, %0. This adds the two arguments and returns the result. The 'nsw' flag means "no signed wrap", which indicates that the addition doesn't wrap around in a signed integer context.

The attributes for the function are set, like mustprogress, nofree, etc., which are optimizations and constraints, but for decompilation, the main focus is the function body.

So putting it together, the function is a simple addition of two integers. The C++ code would have a function that takes two ints and returns their sum.

I should write a C++ function named add that does this. Since the function is in the global namespace, the code should define it without any class or namespace.

So the source code would be something like:

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

That's the core of it. I don't think there are any other parts to this code since the IR is minimal. There's no main function, so if I want to run it directly, I might need to add a main function that tests it, but the user just asked for the decompiled code that I can run. However, since it's a function, to make it runnable, I might need to include a main that calls it.

Wait, but the user said to decompile the file_content, which is just this function. So perhaps the answer is just the function, but to make it a complete program, I might need to add a main. But the user didn't specify that, so maybe just the function is sufficient.

Alternatively, if the original source was a single function, then the decompiled code would be just that function. So the answer is the C++ function as above.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can observe that the function `_Z3addii` is a simple addition of two integers. Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

This function takes two `int` parameters and returns their sum, matching the behavior described by the IR code.
