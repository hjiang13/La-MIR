Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code does.

Looking at the function definition: define dso_local i32 @_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE(%"class.std::vector"* nocapture readonly %0) local_unnamed_addr #0. This seems to be a function called sum_squares that takes a std::vector<int> as an argument and returns an i32, which is a 32-bit integer. So the function signature in C++ would be something like int sum_squares(const std::vector<int>& vec).

Next, I'll look at the function's body. The IR starts by getting the elements of the vector. It uses getelementptr and load instructions to get the data. The vector's data is accessed through its implementation details, which suggests that the function is iterating over the vector's elements.

The function seems to handle the case where the vector is empty by checking if the size is zero. If it is, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of squares of the elements. 

Looking deeper, there are loops and some optimizations. The loop uses a phi node to accumulate the sum. It checks if the current index is a multiple of 3 and either squares the element or cubes it if it's not a multiple. This suggests that every third element is treated differently.

I need to translate this logic into C++. So the function will loop through each element, check its index, and add either the square or cube to the sum. 

I'll structure the code by initializing sum to 0, then looping from 0 to the size of the vector. For each index, if it's a multiple of 3, add the square; else, add the cube. Wait, no, looking back, the IR seems to cube when not a multiple. So I'll adjust that.

Wait, in the IR, when the remainder is 0, it's a multiple of 3, and it squares the element. Otherwise, it cubes it. So in C++, for each element, if (i % 3 == 0), add element squared; else, add element cubed.

I should write the function accordingly, making sure to handle the vector correctly and return the accumulated sum.

I'll test the logic with sample data to ensure it matches the IR's behavior. For example, if the vector has elements 1, 2, 3, the sum would be 1^2 + 2^3 + 3^2 = 1 + 8 + 9 = 18.

Finally, I'll write the C++ function, ensuring it's efficient and matches the IR's logic.

To decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code, we can analyze the structure and operations in the IR and translate them into equivalent C++ constructs. The IR appears to implement a function that calculates the sum of squares of elements in a vector, with some optimizations.

Here's the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

int sum_squares(const std::vector<int>& vec) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        if (i % 3 == 0) {
            sum += vec[i] * vec[i];  // Square the element
        } else {
            sum += vec[i] * vec[i] * vec[i];  // Cube the element
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**: The IR defines a function `_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` which corresponds to a C++ function named `sum_squares` that takes a `const std::vector<int>&` as its parameter and returns an `int`.

2. **Vector Operations**: The IR manipulates the vector by accessing its elements through pointer arithmetic. In C++, this is handled more cleanly using vector indexing.

3. **Loop and Conditional Logic**: The IR includes a loop that processes each element of the vector. It checks if the current index is a multiple of 3 and either squares or cubes the element based on this condition.

4. **Sum Accumulation**: The function accumulates the sum of these squared or cubed values and returns the final sum.

This C++ code should produce the same behavior as the original LLVM IR code.
