Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an LLVM IR code and wants it decompiled back into C or C++ source code that can be run directly. My goal is to understand what the IR code does and then translate that into a high-level language.

First, I'll start by examining the IR code provided. The function in question is `@_Z20right_angle_trianglefff`, which from the naming convention, seems to be a C++ function. The suffix `fff` indicates it takes three float arguments. The function returns a boolean (`i1` in IR terms).

Looking at the code, the function computes several floating-point operations. Let's break it down:

1. **Compute squares of the inputs:**
   - `%4 = fmul float %0, %0` → a²
   - `%5 = fmul float %1, %1` → b²
   - `%7 = fmul float %2, %2` → c²

2. **Check if a² + b² equals c² within a tolerance:**
   - `%6 = fadd float %4, %5` → a² + b²
   - `%8 = fsub float %6, %7` → (a² + b²) - c²
   - `%9 = call float @llvm.fabs.f32(float %8)` → absolute value of the difference
   - `%10 = fpext float %9 to double` → extend to double for comparison
   - `%11 = fcmp olt double %10, 1.000000e-04` → check if difference is less than 1e-4
   - If true, branch to label 25, else proceed.

3. **If the first check fails, check if a² + c² equals b²:**
   - `%13 = fadd float %4, %7` → a² + c²
   - `%14 = fsub float %13, %5` → (a² + c²) - b²
   - Similarly, compute absolute value and compare with 1e-4.

4. **If the second check also fails, check if b² + c² equals a²:**
   - `%19 = fadd float %5, %7` → b² + c²
   - `%20 = fsub float %19, %4` → (b² + c²) - a²
   - Again, compute absolute value and compare.

5. **If none of the checks pass, all three conditions are false, so return false.**

Putting this together, the function checks if the three given sides form a right-angled triangle by verifying the Pythagorean theorem for all three combinations. If any combination satisfies the condition within the tolerance, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

Now, to write the C++ function, I'll translate these steps directly. I'll compute the squares, check each combination using the absolute difference within the specified tolerance, and return the result accordingly.

I should also note the tolerance used (1e-4) to ensure the floating-point comparisons are accurate enough without being too strict. This approach avoids issues with direct equality checks in floating-point arithmetic.

Finally, I'll structure the function to return true as soon as any condition is met and false otherwise, ensuring efficient evaluation without unnecessary computations once a condition is satisfied.

The given LLVM IR code appears to be a function that checks if three floating-point numbers can form a right-angled triangle. Specifically, it checks whether the Pythagorean theorem holds for any combination of the three sides. 

Here's the decompiled C++ code equivalent to the provided IR:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

bool right_angle_triangle(float a, float b, float c) {
    float a_sq = a * a;
    float b_sq = b * b;
    float c_sq = c * c;
    
    float diff = std::fabs((a_sq + b_sq) - c_sq);
    if (diff < 1e-4) {
        return true;
    }
    
    diff = std::fabs((a_sq + c_sq) - b_sq);
    if (diff < 1e-4) {
        return true;
    }
    
    diff = std::fabs((b_sq + c_sq) - a_sq);
    if (diff < 1e-4) {
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `right_angle_triangle` takes three `float` arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Square Calculation**: It calculates the squares of all three sides:
   - `a_sq = a * a`
   - `b_sq = b * b`
   - `c_sq = c * c`

3. **Pythagorean Check**: It checks if any combination of the sides satisfies the Pythagorean theorem within a small tolerance (`1e-4`):
   - First, it checks if `a^2 + b^2 ≈ c^2`
   - Then, it checks if `a^2 + c^2 ≈ b^2`
   - Finally, it checks if `b^2 + c^2 ≈ a^2`

4. **Absolute Difference**: For each check, it calculates the absolute difference between the sums of squares and compares it to the tolerance `1e-4`. If any of these differences is below the threshold, it returns `true`.

5. **Return Value**: If none of the combinations satisfy the Pythagorean theorem within the tolerance, the function returns `false`.

This code can be directly compiled and run in a C++ environment.
