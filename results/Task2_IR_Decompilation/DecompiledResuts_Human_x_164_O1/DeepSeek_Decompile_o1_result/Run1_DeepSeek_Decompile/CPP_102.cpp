<think>
Okay, so I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code that I can run directly. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

Looking at the IR code, there's a function called @_Z10choose_numii, which I think is _Z10choose_numii in C++ terms, probably a function named choose_num with two integer parameters.

The function starts by comparing the two integers with icmp slt, which is "signed less than". So %3 is 1 if %1 is less than %0, else 0. Then it branches: if true, it goes to label 12, else to label 4.

At label 4, it checks if %1 equals %0. Then it computes the remainder of %1 divided by 2 using srem. So %6 is %1 mod 2. Then it checks if %6 equals 1, so %7 is whether %1 is odd.

Then it does an 'and' of %5 (whether %1 == %0) and %7 (whether %1 is odd). So if both are true, it branches to label 12, else to label 9.

At label 9, it sign-extends %7 (which is a boolean) to i32, so that's 0 or 1. Then it adds that to %1 to get %11. So if %7 is 1 (odd), it adds 1 to %1, else adds 0.

Finally, at label 12, it uses a phi node to get the return value. The phi node takes -1 from labels 2 and 4, and %11 from label 9. So the function returns -1 in some cases, and %11 in others.

Putting this together, the function seems to return -1 in most cases, except when certain conditions are met. Let me try to map the logic.

The initial branch is if %1 < %0, then return -1. Else, check if %1 == %0. If so, and if %1 is odd, return -1. If not, then check if %1 is odd again, and if so, return %1 +1, else return -1. Wait, that might not be right. Let me trace it step by step.

When the function starts, if %1 is less than %0, return -1.

If %1 >= %0, then check if %1 equals %0. If they are equal, and if %1 is odd, then return -1. Otherwise, proceed to label 9.

At label 9, if %1 is odd, add 1 to it and return that value.

Wait, maybe the function is trying to choose a number that's different from a previous choice, ensuring it's even? Or perhaps it's selecting the next odd number after some condition.

Wait, maybe I should write pseudocode first.

Function choose_num(i32 a, i32 b):
    if b < a:
        return -1
    if b == a and b is odd:
        return -1
    if b is odd:
        return b + 1
    else:
        return -1

Wait, that doesn't make sense because in the else part, it's returning -1. But in the code, after label 9, it returns %11, which is %1 + (b mod 2 == 1). So when b is odd, it's adding 1, making it even, and returns that. Otherwise, adds 0, so returns b.

Wait, no. Let's see: %10 is sext of %7, which is 1 if b is odd, else 0. Then %11 is add nsw i32 %10, %1, so if b is odd, it's b +1, else b +0.

So the function returns:

- If b < a: -1
- Else if b == a and b is odd: -1
- Else if b is odd: b +1
- Else: b

Wait, that's possible. So the function returns either -1, b, or b+1 based on these conditions.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me try to structure it:

if (b < a) return -1;
else {
    if (b == a && (b % 2 ==1)) return -1;
    else {
        if (b % 2 ==1) return b +1;
        else return b;
    }
}

Wait, but in the code, after the initial check, if b >= a, it goes to label 4. There, it checks if b ==a. If yes, and if b is odd, then it returns -1. Else, it proceeds to label 9, where if b is odd, it returns b+1, else returns b.

Wait, no. Because in label 4, if (b == a) and (b is odd), it branches to label 12, which is the return point. Else, it goes to label 9.

Wait, the code at label 4 is:

%5 = icmp eq i32 %1, %0 --> b == a
%6 = srem i32 %1, 2 --> b mod 2
%7 = icmp eq i32 %6, 1 --> b is odd
%8 = and i1 %5, %7 --> (b ==a) && (b is odd)
br i1 %8, label %12, label %9

So if (b ==a) and (b is odd), it goes to label 12, which is the return of -1. Else, it goes to label 9.

At label 9:

%10 = sext i1 %7 to i32 --> 1 if b is odd, else 0
%11 = add nsw i32 %10, %1 --> b + (b is odd ? 1 : 0)
br label %12

So label 12 returns either -1 or %11.

So the function returns:

if (b < a) --> -1
elif (b == a and b is odd) --> -1
else:
    if (b is odd) --> b +1
    else --> b

So the function chooses a number based on some conditions. Now, to write the C++ code, I need to make sure all these conditions are covered.

I think the C++ function would look like this:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (b == a && (b % 2 == 1)) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (b % 2 == 1) {
        return b + 1;
    } else {
        return b;
    }
}

Wait, but let me test with some examples.

Example 1: a=5, b=3
b < a: yes, return -1.

Example 2: a=4, b=4
b ==a and b is even (4%2=0), so go to else. b is even, return 4.

Example 3: a=3, b=3
b ==a and b is odd, return -1.

Example 4: a=2, b=3
b >=a. b !=a. b is odd: return 4.

Example 5: a=2, b=4
b >=a. b !=a. b is even: return 4.

Wait, but in the code, when b >=a and not (b ==a and b is odd), then if b is odd, return b+1, else return b.

So the function returns b+1 if b is odd and not in the (b==a and odd) case, else returns b.

I think that's correct.

So the C++ code should implement these conditions.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into a C++ function, we analyze the logic and translate it into equivalent C++ statements. The function `_Z10choose_numii` is translated to `choose_num`, which takes two integers and returns an integer based on specific conditions.

Here is the step-by-step explanation and the resulting C++ code:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `choose_num` takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`.

2. **Condition 1**: If `b` is less than `a`, return `-1`.

3. **Condition 2**: If `b` is equal to `a` and `b` is odd, return `-1`.

4. **Condition 3**: If `b` is odd, return `b + 1`.

5. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, return `b`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (b == a && (b % 2 == 1)) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (b % 2 == 1) {
        return b + 1;
    } else {
        return b;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Test cases
    std::cout << choose_num(5, 3) << std::endl;   // Output: -1
    std::cout << choose_num(4, 4) << std::endl;   // Output: 4
    std::cout << choose_num(3, 3) << std::endl;   // Output: -1
    std::cout << choose_num(2, 3) << std::endl;   // Output: 4
    std::cout << choose_num(2, 4) << std::endl;   // Output: 4
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code accurately reflects the logic of the original LLVM IR, handling all specified conditions and returning the appropriate values.
