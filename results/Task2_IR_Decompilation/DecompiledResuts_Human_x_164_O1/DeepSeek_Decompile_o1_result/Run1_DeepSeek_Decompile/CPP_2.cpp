Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code that can be run directly. Let's start by understanding what the IR code is doing.

Looking at the function `_Z15truncate_numberf(float %0)`, it seems to take a float as input. The function has a few steps:

1. `fptosi float %0 to i32`: This converts the float to a signed integer. So, it's truncating the decimal part because converting a float to an integer in this way discards the fractional part.

2. `sitofp i32 %2 to float`: This takes the integer result from the previous step and converts it back to a float. So now we have the truncated value as a float.

3. `fsub float %0, %3`: This subtracts the truncated float from the original input float. Essentially, this is calculating the fractional part that was removed during truncation.

So putting it all together, the function takes a float, truncates it to an integer, subtracts that from the original to get the fractional part, and returns that.

Now, translating this into C++. The function name in C++ would be `truncate_number` taking a float and returning a float. The steps in C++ would be:

- Take the input float.
- Cast it to an integer to truncate the decimal part.
- Convert it back to a float.
- Subtract this from the original to get the fractional part.

I should write this as a function. Also, considering the function attributes, it's likely that the original function is inlined or optimized, but for the purpose of decompilation, a simple function should suffice.

So the C++ code would look like:

float truncate_number(float x) {
    int truncated = static_cast<int>(x);
    float truncated_float = static_cast<float>(truncated);
    return x - truncated_float;
}

Wait, but in C++, when you cast a float to an int, it does truncate towards zero by default. So this should correctly replicate the IR's behavior.

I should also make sure to include a `main` function so that the code can be run directly, perhaps testing the function with sample inputs.

Putting it all together, the complete source code would have the function definition and a main function to test it.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we'll translate each IR instruction into its corresponding C++ operation. The function calculates the fractional part of a given floating-point number by truncating it and subtracting the truncated value from the original.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

float truncate_number(float x) {
    int truncated = static_cast<int>(x);
    float truncated_float = static_cast<float>(truncated);
    return x - truncated_float;
}

int main() {
    float num = 3.14159f;
    float fractional_part = truncate_number(num);
    std::cout << "Fractional part of " << num << " is " << fractional_part << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `truncate_number` takes a float `x` as input.
   - It truncates `x` to an integer using `static_cast<int>(x)`, discarding the fractional part.
   - The truncated integer is cast back to a float.
   - The function returns the result of subtracting the truncated float from the original input, yielding the fractional part.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Demonstrates the usage of `truncate_number` with a sample value.
   - Outputs the original number and its calculated fractional part.

This code can be compiled and run to test the functionality, providing the fractional part of any given floating-point number.
