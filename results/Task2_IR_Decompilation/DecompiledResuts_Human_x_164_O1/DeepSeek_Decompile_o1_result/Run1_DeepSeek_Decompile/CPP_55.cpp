Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by carefully analyzing the provided IR.

First, I notice the function is named @_Z3fibi, which when demangled, suggests it's a function named "fib" with some parameters. The function takes an i32 (integer) argument and returns an i32. So the C++ function signature will probably be something like int fib(int n).

Looking at the IR, the function starts by allocating space for an array of 1000 integers. It uses alloca, which in C++ would correspond to a local array on the stack. So I'll create an array like int fibArray[1000];.

Next, the code initializes the first two elements of the array. The first element (index 0) is set to 0, and the second (index 1) is set to 1. So I'll write fibArray[0] = 0; and fibArray[1] = 1;.

Then there's a conditional check: if the input is less than 2, it branches to label 12. Otherwise, it proceeds to label 7. So I'll have an if statement: if (n < 2) { ... } else { ... }.

Inside the if block (label 12), it loads the value from the array at index n and returns it. So in C++, that would be return fibArray[n];.

In the else block (label 7), it starts a loop. The loop uses a phi instruction to track the current value and index. The loop initializes with i = 2 and current value from index 1. Then, in each iteration, it calculates the next value by adding the current and previous values, stores it in the array, and increments the index.

I'll translate this into a for loop starting from 2 up to n. Inside the loop, each iteration calculates fibArray[i] = fibArray[i-1] + fibArray[i-2];.

Putting it all together, the function initializes the array, checks if n is less than 2, and if not, iterates from 2 to n computing each Fibonacci number. Finally, it returns fibArray[n].

I should also note that the array is 1000 elements, so the function assumes n is within this range. If n is larger, it might cause an out-of-bounds access, but the original code doesn't handle that, so I'll proceed accordingly.

So the final code will have the function initialize the array, handle the base cases, and then compute the Fibonacci numbers iteratively for n >= 2.

To decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code, I'll analyze the IR step by step and map it to equivalent C++ constructs.

### Analysis of the IR Code:
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `@_Z3fibi` is defined, which likely corresponds to a function named `fib` with one parameter.
   - The function takes an `i32` (32-bit integer) argument and returns an `i32`.

2. **Array Allocation**:
   - The function allocates space for an array of 1000 integers using `alloca`.
   - This corresponds to a local array in C++.

3. **Array Initialization**:
   - The first element of the array is initialized to 0.
   - The second element is initialized to 1.

4. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If the input value is less than 2, the function returns the corresponding value directly from the array.

5. **Loop Construction**:
   - For values greater than or equal to 2, the function uses a loop to compute the Fibonacci sequence iteratively.
   - The loop starts from index 2 and goes up to the input value, computing each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding numbers.

### Decompiled C++ Code:
Here is the decompiled C++ source code based on the provided IR:

```cpp
int fib(int n) {
    int fibArray[1000];
    fibArray[0] = 0;
    fibArray[1] = 1;

    if (n < 2) {
        return fibArray[n];
    }

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        fibArray[i] = fibArray[i-1] + fibArray[i-2];
    }

    return fibArray[n];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**:
   - The function `fib` takes an integer `n` and returns an integer.

2. **Array Initialization**:
   - A local array `fibArray` of size 1000 is declared and initialized with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1).

3. **Base Case**:
   - If `n` is less than 2, the function returns `fibArray[n]` directly, which handles the cases where `n` is 0 or 1.

4. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - For `n` greater than or equal to 2, the function uses a `for` loop starting from 2 up to `n`.
   - In each iteration, the current Fibonacci number is calculated as the sum of the two preceding numbers and stored in the array.

5. **Return Value**:
   - After the loop completes, the function returns the nth Fibonacci number from the array.

This C++ code accurately reflects the behavior described by the provided LLVM IR code, implementing an iterative approach to compute Fibonacci numbers using a local array for storage.
