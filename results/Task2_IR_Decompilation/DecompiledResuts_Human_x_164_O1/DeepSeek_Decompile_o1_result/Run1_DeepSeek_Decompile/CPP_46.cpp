Okay, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C or C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the code is doing. 

Looking at the function definition, it's a function named _Z4fib4i, which I believe is the mangled name for a function called fib4i. The function takes an i32 parameter, which is an integer, and returns an i32. 

The function starts by allocating space for an array of 100 integers. It then stores some initial values: the first element is 0, the second is 0, the third is 2, and the fourth is 0. So the array starts as [0, 0, 2, 0, ...]. 

Next, there's a condition checking if the input is less than 4. If it is, the function branches to label 14, which seems to handle the base cases by loading the precomputed value from the array and returning it. Otherwise, it proceeds to label 9.

At label 9, it increments the input by 1 and converts it to a 64-bit integer. Then it loads the value from the array at index 3 into %13 and branches to label 18.

Label 18 is a loop. It uses phi nodes to track the current value of the loop. The loop calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding the previous three numbers. It stores each new value back into the array and increments the loop counter until it reaches the input value.

Putting this together, the function initializes an array with the first few Fibonacci numbers and then computes subsequent numbers iteratively, storing each result in the array. This suggests that the function is using memoization to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations.

In C++, this would translate to a function that initializes an array, checks for base cases, and then iterates to compute the Fibonacci number for the given input. The use of an array to store intermediate results is a common optimization technique for recursive algorithms to improve performance.

So, the C++ code should define an array, initialize it with the base cases, and then loop from the fourth index up to the input value, computing each Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous three. Finally, it returns the computed value for the input index.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify Function and Parameters**: The function `_Z4fib4i` is the mangled name for `fib4i`, taking an integer and returning an integer.

2. **Understand Memory Allocation**: The function allocates an array of 100 integers to store Fibonacci numbers.

3. **Initialize Base Cases**: The first four elements are set to 0, 0, 2, and 0, respectively.

4. **Base Case Handling**: If the input is less than 4, return the corresponding value directly from the array.

5. **Iterative Calculation**: For inputs 4 and above, compute each Fibonacci number iteratively using the previous three values and store them in the array.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fib4(int n) {
    int fib_array[100];
    fib_array[0] = 0;
    fib_array[1] = 0;
    fib_array[2] = 2;
    fib_array[3] = 0;

    if (n < 4) {
        return fib_array[n];
    }

    int i = 4;
    for (; i <= n; ++i) {
        fib_array[i] = fib_array[i-1] + fib_array[i-2] + fib_array[i-3];
    }

    return fib_array[n];
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int result = fib4(10);
    cout << "Fibonacci number at position 10: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Function Definition**: `fib4` takes an integer `n` and initializes an array to store Fibonacci numbers.
- **Base Cases**: The first four elements are initialized to handle small values of `n` directly.
- **Iteration**: For `n >= 4`, the loop calculates each Fibonacci number using the sum of the previous three, storing each result.
- **Return**: The function returns the computed Fibonacci number for `n`.
- **Example Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates how to call `fib4` and print the result.

This code efficiently computes the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with memoization to optimize performance.
