Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++. Let's see what this code is doing. 

Looking at the IR, I see a function named @fibfibi which takes an i32 parameter. The function starts by allocating space for 100 i32 elements, which means it's creating an array of 100 integers. The allocation is done with alloca, so it's on the stack. Then there's a bitcast to i8*, which is probably for handling the array as a byte array for the lifetime functions.

Next, there are some initial stores. It's storing 0, 0, and 1 into the first three elements of the array. That makes me think this is a Fibonacci sequence because the initial values are 0, 0, 1. So maybe the array is used to memoize Fibonacci numbers.

There's a condition checking if the input is less than 3. If so, it branches to label 13, which seems to handle the base cases by returning the value directly from the array. If not, it goes to label 8.

In label 8, it's adding 1 to the input and zero-extending it to i64, probably for index calculations. Then it loads the value from index 2 of the array, which is the third element (since indexing starts at 0), and branches to label 17.

Label 17 looks like a loop. It uses phi nodes to track the current value and index. It's loading values from the array, adding them, storing the result back, and incrementing the index. This loop continues until the index reaches the input value, and then it exits by branching back to label 13.

Putting this together, the function is calculating the nth Fibonacci number using memoization with an array. The loop starts from 3 up to n, computing each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two previous ones and storing it in the array.

So in C++, this would translate to a function that initializes an array with the first three Fibonacci numbers, then iterates from 3 to the input value, computing each subsequent number and storing it. Finally, it returns the nth number from the array.

I think the function is named fib, taking an integer and returning an integer. The array is local, so each function call has its own, which is fine. The loop runs from 3 to n, inclusive, and each iteration calculates fib[i] as fib[i-1] + fib[i-2].

Wait, but in the IR, the initial stores are at indices 0, 1, 2 with values 0, 0, 1. So the array is 0-based, so index 0 is 0, index 1 is 0, index 2 is 1, which would make the sequence start as 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, etc. So for n=0, returns 0; n=1, returns 0; n=2, returns 1. Then for higher n, it builds up using the array.

So the C++ code should replicate this behavior. The function will check if n is less than 3 and return the corresponding value from the array. Otherwise, it loops from 3 to n, computing each step.

I think that's the gist of it. Now, let me write the C++ code that does this.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we need to understand the operations being performed. The IR code implements a function that calculates Fibonacci numbers using an array for memoization. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Array Allocation**: The function allocates an array of 100 integers on the stack.
2. **Initialization**: The first three elements are initialized to 0, 0, and 1, respectively.
3. **Base Case Handling**: If the input is less than 3, the function returns the corresponding value directly from the array.
4. **Loop for Calculation**: For inputs greater than or equal to 3, the function iterates from 3 to the input value, computing each Fibonacci number by summing the two preceding values and storing the result in the array.
5. **Return Result**: After computing up to the input value, the function returns the nth Fibonacci number.

Here's the C++ code that matches this behavior:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    int fib_array[100];
    fib_array[0] = 0;
    fib_array[1] = 0;
    fib_array[2] = 1;

    if (n < 3) {
        return fib_array[n];
    }

    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
        fib_array[i] = fib_array[i-1] + fib_array[i-2];
    }

    return fib_array[n];
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the index for Fibonacci number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Fibonacci number at index " << n << " is: " << fib(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Array Initialization**: The array `fib_array` is initialized with the first three Fibonacci numbers: 0, 0, 1.
- **Base Case Handling**: Directly returns the value from the array if `n` is 0, 1, or 2.
- **Loop Calculation**: For `n >= 3`, the loop computes each Fibonacci number iteratively up to `n` and stores it in the array.
- **Return**: The function returns the nth Fibonacci number from the array.

This code provides a clear and efficient way to compute Fibonacci numbers using an iterative approach with memoization, matching the behavior of the provided LLVM IR code.
