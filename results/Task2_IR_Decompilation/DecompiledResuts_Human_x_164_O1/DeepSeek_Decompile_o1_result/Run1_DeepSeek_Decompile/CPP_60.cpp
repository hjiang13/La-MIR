Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C or C++ source code that can be run directly. Let's start by looking at the IR code provided.

The function is named @_Z8sum_to_ni and it takes an i32 parameter. The function attributes suggest it's a simple, non-recursive function that doesn't modify memory and should be optimizable.

Looking at the code inside the function:
1. %2 is calculated as the sum of %0 and 1. So that's adding 1 to the input.
2. %3 is the product of %2 and %0. That's multiplying the incremented value by the original input.
3. %4 is the signed integer division of %3 by 2. So we're taking the product and dividing by 2.
4. Finally, %4 is returned.

Putting this together, the function computes (n * (n + 1)) / 2, which is the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. So the function is calculating the sum from 1 to n.

The name @_Z8sum_to_ni suggests it's a C++ function because of the name mangling. Demangling it, _Z8sum_to_ni becomes "sum_to_ni", which is likely a function that sums up to n.

In C++, the function would be something like:

int sum_to_ni(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

But wait, when I multiply n by (n+1), if n is large, this might cause an integer overflow. However, since the IR uses 'mul nsw', which is 'no signed wrap', meaning it's assuming that the multiplication doesn't overflow. So the function is designed under the assumption that the multiplication doesn't cause an overflow beyond 32 bits.

So the C++ code should directly translate each step. Let me write that out.

To decompile the given LLVM IR code into a C++ function, we analyze each step:

1. The function takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It calculates `n + 1`.
3. Multiplies `n` by `(n + 1)`.
4. Divides the result by 2.
5. Returns the final value.

This computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- **Function Definition:** The function is named `sum_to_ni` and takes an `int` parameter.
- **Calculation:** It uses the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2` to compute the sum efficiently.
- **Return Value:** The result is returned as an `int`.

**Decompiled C++ Code:**

```cpp
int sum_to_ni(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```

This function can be compiled and run in a C++ environment to compute the sum of the first `n` integers.
