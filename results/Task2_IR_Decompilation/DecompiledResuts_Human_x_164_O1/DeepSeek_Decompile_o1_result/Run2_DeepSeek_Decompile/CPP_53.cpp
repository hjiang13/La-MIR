Okay, I'm looking at this problem where I have to decompile some LLVM IR code into C or C++ source code that can be run directly. The user provided the IR code, and I need to figure out what the original source code might look like.

First, I'll examine the IR code. The module ID and source filename point to a C++ file, specifically "CPP_53.cpp". That suggests that the original code was written in C++. The function defined here is @_Z3addii, which I recognize as the mangled name for a function add taking two integers and returning an integer.

Looking at the function definition, it's very simple. It adds the two i32 parameters and returns the result. The attributes indicate that it's a straightforward function without any side effects, which makes sense for an add function.

I'll start by demangling the function name. @_Z3addii is a C++ mangled name. Breaking it down, "Z3addii" means a function named add taking two ints. So in C++, this would be something like int add(int, int).

Next, I'll look at the function body. The IR shows that the function adds the two parameters and returns the result. There are no other operations, so the C++ function should be just as simple.

I also notice the target triple is x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, which means it's compiled for a 64-bit Linux system. The data layout and target features are standard for that platform.

Considering all this, the C++ source code should define a function add that takes two integers, adds them, and returns the sum. Since it's a free function, I'll write it outside any class or namespace. Including a main function would allow the user to test it directly, so I'll add that as well.

I'll make sure to include the necessary headers, like <iostream> for input and output, so the example can compile and run without issues.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the IR and translate it back into a high-level programming language. The IR code defines a simple function `add` that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. Here's the corresponding C++ source code:

```cpp
// CPP_53.cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 10); // Example usage
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The IR defines a function `add` that takes two integers and returns their sum. In C++, this translates directly to a function `int add(int a, int b)`.

2. **Main Function**: Added a `main` function to demonstrate the usage of the `add` function. It computes the sum of 5 and 10 and prints the result.

3. **Includes**: Included `<iostream>` for input/output operations in the `main` function.

4. **Usage Example**: The `main` function provides a simple example of how to use the `add` function and print the result.

### Usage:
1. Save this code in a file named `CPP_53.cpp`.
2. Compile it using a C++ compiler like `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o CPP_53 CPP_53.cpp
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./CPP_53
   ```
   This will output:
   ```
   Result: 15
   ```

This C++ code matches the functionality of the provided LLVM IR code and can be executed directly.
