Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code that I need to decompile back into C++ code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I'll look at the function definition. The function is named @_Z4fib4i, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find that it translates to "fib(int)". So the function is called fib and takes an integer as an argument.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by allocating an array of 100 integers. It uses alloca, which means it's on the stack. The array is initialized with a size of 400 bytes (since each i32 is 4 bytes), so that makes sense for 100 elements.

Next, there are some initial stores into the array. The first element is stored as 0, the second as 0, the third as 2, and the fourth as 0. So the initial array looks like [0, 0, 2, 0, ...]. It seems like we're setting up some base cases for the Fibonacci sequence.

Then there's an ICMP instruction checking if the input is less than 4. If it is, it branches to label 14, otherwise to label 9. So for n < 4, we return the nth element directly, but it looks like the array is being used to store precomputed values, maybe using memoization or dynamic programming.

Looking at label 9, it increments the input by 1 and converts it to a 64-bit integer. Then it loads the value from index 3 of the array, which was initialized to 0. It proceeds to a loop at label 18.

In the loop, there are phi nodes, which suggests that it's using some form of loop variable tracking. The loop seems to be iterating from 4 up to the input value, computing each Fibonacci number based on previous values. Each iteration loads the last three elements, adds them together, and stores the result back into the array.

The loop continues until it reaches the input value, at which point it exits and returns the computed Fibonacci number. The function uses the stack-allocated array to store intermediate results, which helps in avoiding recomputation and speeds things up.

Putting it all together, the function is a memoized Fibonacci implementation that precomputes values up to the given input using an array. This should be more efficient than a recursive approach because it avoids redundant calculations.

I think I can translate this into C++ by creating a function that initializes an array, sets the base cases, and then iteratively computes each subsequent Fibonacci number up to n, returning the nth value. The use of an array for memoization will make the function run in linear time, which is efficient for this problem.

The provided LLVM IR code implements a Fibonacci function with memoization using an array to store intermediate results, optimizing performance by avoiding redundant calculations. Here's the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    int fib_array[100];
    fib_array[0] = 0;
    fib_array[1] = 0;
    fib_array[2] = 2;
    fib_array[3] = 0;

    if (n < 4) {
        return fib_array[n];
    }

    int i = 4;
    for (; i <= n; ++i) {
        fib_array[i] = fib_array[i-1] + fib_array[i-2] + fib_array[i-3];
    }

    return fib_array[n];
}

int main() {
    int result = fib(10); // Example usage
    cout << "Fibonacci number: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The function `fib` takes an integer `n` and initializes an array `fib_array` of size 100.
- Base cases are set for indices 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- For `n < 4`, it returns the precomputed value directly.
- For `n >= 4`, it iterates from 4 to `n`, computing each Fibonacci number as the sum of the three preceding values.
- The computed value at index `n` is returned.

This approach ensures efficient computation with a linear time complexity, making it suitable for large values of `n`.
