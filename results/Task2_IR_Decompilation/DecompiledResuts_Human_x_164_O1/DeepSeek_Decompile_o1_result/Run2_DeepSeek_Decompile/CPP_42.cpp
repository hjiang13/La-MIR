Okay, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me see what this function is doing step by step.

First, I notice the function is named @_Z9incr_listSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. Using a C++ name demangler, this translates to void incr_list(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int>>). So the function takes two vectors, one by value (since it's an output parameter) and one by reference.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by accessing elements of the vector. It gets the end iterator (%3) and the begin iterator (%5). It then calculates the difference between end and begin, which gives the size of the vector. If the size is zero, it jumps to label 14.

At label 14, it seems to be copying the pointers from the input vector (%1) to the output vector (%0). It stores the begin pointer into %0, the end pointer into %0, and the end of the data into %0. Then it does a memset on the input vector, probably to zero it out.

If the vector isn't empty, it goes to label 11. There, it calculates half the size of the vector (using ashr by 2) and takes the maximum with 1 to avoid zero. Then it enters a loop at label 21.

In the loop, it increments each element of the vector by 1, starting from index 0 up to the calculated size. After each increment, it checks if it's reached the end and either continues the loop or exits to label 14.

Putting this together, the function seems to create a new vector with the same data as the input, but increments each element by 1. Then it zeros out the input vector.

So the C++ code would involve creating a new vector, looping through each element of the input, incrementing, and copying the data. After processing, it would clear the input vector, perhaps by resetting its pointers and using memset.

I need to make sure to handle the vector operations correctly, ensuring that the new vector is properly constructed and that the input vector is cleared without causing memory leaks. Since vectors manage their own memory, simply resetting the pointers and calling memset might not be the standard approach, but in this specific case, the IR does that, so I'll replicate it in code.

I also need to include necessary headers like <vector> and <cstring> for memset. The function should take the output vector by value and the input by reference.

I think that's the gist of it. Now, I'll write the C++ code that matches this behavior.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

void incr_list(vector<int> result, const vector<int>& input) {
    if (input.empty()) {
        // Copy empty input to result and clear input
        result = input;
        memset(&const_cast<vector<int>&>(input), 0, sizeof(vector<int>));
        return;
    }

    size_t size = input.size();
    size_t half_size = (size >> 1) > 0 ? (size >> 1) : 1;

    // Copy input data to result
    result._M_impl._M_start = input._M_impl._M_start;
    result._M_impl._M_end = input._M_impl._M_end;
    result._M_impl._M_impl_data._M_end_of_storage = input._M_impl._M_impl_data._M_end_of_storage;

    // Zero out the input vector's data
    memset(&input, 0, sizeof(vector<int>));

    // Increment each element in the input
    for (size_t i = 0; i < half_size; ++i) {
        ++input._M_impl._M_start[i];
    }
}
```

This C++ code defines a function `incr_list` that takes a `vector<int>` by value and a `const vector<int>&` as input. It performs operations similar to the provided IR, including handling empty vectors, copying data, zeroing out memory, and incrementing elements.
