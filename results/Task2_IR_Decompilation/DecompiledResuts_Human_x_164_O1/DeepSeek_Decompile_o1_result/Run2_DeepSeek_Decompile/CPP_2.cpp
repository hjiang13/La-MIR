Alright, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the function is doing.

Looking at the IR code, the function is named _Z15truncate_numberf, which when demangled translates to truncate_numberf. It takes a float as input and returns a float.

The function does the following:
1. It converts the input float %0 to an integer using fptosi, which truncates the decimal part.
2. It then converts this integer back to a float with sitofp.
3. It subtracts this converted float from the original input float, effectively giving the fractional part.

So, the purpose of this function is to compute the fractional part of a given floating-point number. The fractional part is what remains after subtracting the integer part from the original number.

To write this in C++, I can use the standard library functions. The integer part can be obtained using the trunc function, which is similar to fptosi. Then, subtracting this integer part from the original number will give the fractional part.

I should also consider including the <cmath> header to use the trunc function. The function takes a float as input and returns a float, so the C++ function should match this signature.

Putting it all together, the C++ function will look similar to the IR code but using standard library functions for clarity and portability.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, let's analyze the function and translate it accordingly.

### Analysis of the IR Code:
The IR code defines a function `@_Z15truncate_numberf` which takes a float and returns a float. The function performs the following operations:
1. Converts the input float to an integer, effectively truncating the decimal part.
2. Converts the integer back to a float.
3. Subtracts this value from the original input to get the fractional part.

### C++ Source Code:
Here's the equivalent C++ function that achieves the same result:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

float truncate_number(float x) {
    float integer_part = std::trunc(x);
    return x - integer_part;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The C++ function `truncate_number` takes a single float argument `x`.
2. **Truncation**: `std::trunc(x)` computes the integer part by truncating the decimal.
3. **Fractional Part Calculation**: Subtracting the integer part from `x` gives the fractional component.

This function can be used to extract the fractional part of a floating-point number, similar to the `frac` function in some math libraries.
