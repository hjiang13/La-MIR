Okay, so I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR is doing. The function is named @_Z9fizz_buzzi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, that should translate to something like fizz_buzzi. 

Looking at the IR, the function takes an i32 argument, so it's returning an integer. The function starts with an icmp instruction comparing the input to 0. If it's greater than 0, it branches to label 5, else it goes to label 3. Label 3 has a phi node for %4, which seems to return 0 or the value from %25. That suggests that if the input is 0 or negative, it returns 0.

Now, label 5 is more complex. It has phi nodes for %6 and %7, which are initialized to 0 on the first pass. Then it calculates the remainder of %6 divided by 11 and 13. If either is 0, it sets some condition. Then it checks if %6 is not zero. The select instruction picks between true or false based on whether either division was a multiple.

If that condition is true, it goes to label 15; else, it goes to 24. Label 15 processes the digits of %16, which starts as %6. It extracts the last digit by srem with 10, checks if it's 7, and if so, adds 1 to %17. Then it divides %16 by 10 and loops back if it's greater than 9.

Label 24 increments %6 by 1 and checks if it's equal to the input. If so, it returns; else, it loops back.

Putting this together, it looks like the function counts how many numbers up to n (the input) are multiples of 11 or 13 and end with 7. So, the C++ code should implement this logic with loops and conditions.

The decompiled C++ code for the given LLVM IR is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fizz_buzzi(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    int count = 0;
    int num = 1;

    while (num <= n) {
        if (num % 11 == 0 || num % 13 == 0) {
            int temp = num;
            while (temp > 9) {
                temp /= 10;
            }
            if (temp == 7) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        num++;
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Result: " << fizz_buzzi(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

The `fizz_buzzi` function counts how many numbers from 1 to `n` meet specific criteria:
1. The number must be a multiple of 11 or 13.
2. The number must end with the digit 7 when truncated to the last two digits.

The `main` function provides a simple interface to input a number and display the result. You can run this code directly after saving it to a `.cpp` file and compiling it with a C++ compiler.
