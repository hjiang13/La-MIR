Okay, so I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best. Let me start by looking at the IR code provided.

First, I see that it's a function named _Z17is_multiply_primei, which from the naming convention, I think is a C++ function. The function takes an i32 (which is a 32-bit integer) and returns a zeroext i1, which is a boolean. So the function is probably named is_multiply_prime, taking an integer and returning a bool.

Looking at the code, the function starts with an icmp (integer comparison) checking if the input is less than 4. If it is, it branches to label 11, else to label 3.

So the first part of the function is handling numbers less than 4. Let me note that down. If the number is less than 4, we go to block 11. In block 11, there's a phi node for %12, which takes 0 from the start and %25 from block 23. Then it checks if %12 equals 2 and returns that as a boolean.

Wait, so if the input is less than 4, we check if some value is equal to 2 and return true or false based on that. But what is %12? It's coming from a phi node that could be 0 or some other value. Hmm.

Let me think about what this function is doing. The name suggests it's checking if a number is a "multiply prime," which I'm not exactly sure of, but maybe it's a prime number. So perhaps it's implementing a primality test.

Looking at the code further, in block 3, there are phi nodes for %4, %5, and %6. %4 seems to be the loop variable starting at 2, %5 starts at 0, and %6 starts at %0, which is the input. Then it computes %7 as the remainder of %6 divided by %4. Then it checks if the remainder is 0 and if %6 is greater than %4. If both are true, it branches to block 14; else, it goes to block 23.

In block 14, %15 and %16 are updated. %17 is computed as the division of %16 by %4, and %18 increments %15. Then it checks if the remainder of %17 divided by %4 is 0 and if %17 is greater than %4. If both, it loops back to 14; else, it goes to 23.

In block 23, it updates %24, %25, increments %4 by 1, computes %26 as 4 squared, and checks if that's greater than %24. If yes, it goes to block 11; else, it loops back to 3.

Putting this together, the function seems to be checking for factors of the input number using trial division, starting from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any divisor is found, it returns false, indicating it's not a prime. Otherwise, it returns true.

Wait, but the function is named is_multiply_prime, which is a bit unclear. Maybe it's checking if the number is a prime that can be multiplied in some way. Or perhaps it's a typo and should be is_prime.

In any case, the logic seems to be checking for primality. So let me try to translate this into C++.

The function starts by checking if the number is less than 4. If so, it handles it specially. For numbers less than 4, primes are 2 and 3. So for 0, 1, it returns false; for 2, 3, it returns true.

In the IR code, block 11 returns whether %12 is equal to 2. But I'm not entirely sure how that translates. Maybe the loop starts with checking 2 as the first divisor.

Putting it all together, I'll write a function that checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to sqrt(n). If any divisor divides n, it's not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

I think that's the approach here. So the C++ code should implement this logic.

Here is the decompiled C++ code from the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_multiply_prime(int n) {
    if (n < 4) {
        return n == 2;
    }

    int i = 2;
    int root = n;
    while (true) {
        int remainder = root % i;
        if (remainder == 0 && root > i) {
            return false;
        }

        if (root <= i) {
            break;
        }

        root /= i;
        i++;
    }

    return true;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << is_multiply_prime(2) << std::endl;  // Should print: true
    std::cout << is_multiply_prime(4) << std::endl;  // Should print: false
    std::cout << is_multiply_prime(5) << std::endl;  // Should print: true
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Function `is_multiply_prime(int n)`**: This function checks if a number `n` is a prime number using trial division up to the square root of `n`.
  - **Initial Check**: If `n` is less than 4, it directly checks if `n` is 2, as 2 is the only prime number less than 4.
  - **Loop**: The loop iterates from 2 upwards, checking if `root` (initially `n`) is divisible by `i`. If it is and `root` is larger than `i`, `n` is not prime. If `root` becomes less than or equal to `i`, the loop exits, confirming `n` is prime.
- **Main Function**: Provides example usage of `is_multiply_prime` with some test cases.

This code should compile and run correctly, demonstrating the primality test as implemented in the LLVM IR.
