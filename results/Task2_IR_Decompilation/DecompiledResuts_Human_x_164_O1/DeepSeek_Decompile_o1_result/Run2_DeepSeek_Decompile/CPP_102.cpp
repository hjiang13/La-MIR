Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's start by looking at the provided IR code.

The function defined is @_Z10choose_numii, which I know from the naming convention is a C++ function. The prefix "_Z" indicates it's a mangled name. Using a demangler, I find that @_Z10choose_numii corresponds to "choose_num(int, int)". So the function takes two integers and returns an integer.

Looking at the parameters, %0 and %1 are the two i32 arguments passed to the function. The function has a few labels: 2, 4, 9, 12.

Starting at label 2, the first instruction is %3 = icmp slt i32 %1, %0. This compares if %1 is less than %0. The result is a boolean (i1). Then it branches to label 12 if true, else to label 4.

At label 4, %5 = icmp eq i32 %1, %0 checks if the two are equal. %6 = srem i32 %1, 2 computes %1 modulo 2, giving the remainder. %7 = icmp eq i32 %6, 1 checks if the remainder is 1, meaning %1 is odd. %8 is the logical AND of %5 and %7. So if both are true (i.e., %1 equals %0 and %1 is odd), it branches to label 12, else to label 9.

At label 9, %10 sext i1 %7 to i32 converts the boolean %7 to an integer, which would be 0 or 1. Then %11 = add nsw i32 %10, %1 adds this 0 or 1 to %1. It then branches to label 12.

Label 12 is where all paths converge. The phi instruction %13 picks the return value based on which label it came from. If from label 2 or 4, it returns -1. If from label 9, it returns %11.

Putting it all together, the function seems to do the following:

- If %1 is less than %0, return -1.
- Else if %1 equals %0 and is odd, return -1.
- Else, if %1 is odd, add 1 to %1 and return that value.
- Otherwise, return -1.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.

Looking at the logic, if %1 < %0, return -1. If %1 == %0 and is odd, return -1. Otherwise, if %1 is odd, return %1 + 1, else return -1. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should step through possible values.

Let's test with some numbers. Suppose %0 is 5 and %1 is 3. Since 3 < 5, return -1.

If %1 is 5, same as %0. Then check if 5 is odd. 5 mod 2 is 1, so yes. So return -1.

If %1 is 6, greater than %0 (5) but even. So %5 is false, so %8 is false, go to label 9. %7 is 6 mod 2 = 0, so %10 is 0. %11 is 6 + 0 = 6. So return 6.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the function returns %1 + 1 only when %1 is odd and greater than %0.

Wait, let's go through the code again.

If %1 < %0: return -1.

Else, check if %1 == %0 and %1 is odd: return -1.

Else, check if %1 is odd. If yes, add 1 to %1 and return it. Else, return -1.

Wait, but in label 9, it's after the else of the previous if. So when %1 is not less than %0, and either %1 != %0 or %1 is even.

Wait, perhaps the logic is:

If %1 < %0 → return -1.

Else if %1 == %0 and %1 is odd → return -1.

Else if %1 is odd → return %1 + 1.

Else → return -1.

Wait, but in label 9, it's after the else of the second if. So when %1 is >= %0, and either %1 != %0 or %1 is even.

In label 9, it computes %7 as %1 mod 2 == 1. If that's true, then %10 is 1, so %11 is %1 +1. Then return that. Else, %10 is 0, so %11 is %1 + 0 = %1. But wait, the phi node in label 12 takes the value from label 9 as %11. So in label 9, regardless of whether %7 is true or false, it returns %11, which is %1 + (0 or 1). But wait, no, because %10 is 0 or 1 based on %7.

Wait, no, in label 9, it's the else clause of the second if. So let's think:

After the first check: if %1 < %0 → return -1.

Else, check if %1 == %0 and %1 is odd. If yes → return -1.

Else, proceed to label 9.

In label 9, check if %1 is odd. If it is, add 1 and return. Else, add 0 and return, which is just %1.

Wait, but the phi node in label 12 takes the value from label 9 as %11, which is %1 + %10. So if %7 is true (i.e., %1 is odd), %10 is 1, so %11 is %1 +1. Otherwise, %10 is 0, so %11 is %1.

So the function returns %1 +1 if %1 is odd and greater than or equal to %0, but not equal to %0 when it's odd. Or if %1 is even and greater than %0, it returns %1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me try an example.

Case 1: a = 5, b = 3 → since 3 <5 → return -1.

Case 2: a=5, b=5 → check if b is odd (5 is odd) → return -1.

Case3: a=5, b=6 → since b >= a, and b !=a. Now, check if b is odd? 6 is even → no. So in label 9, %7 is false, so %10 is 0, %11 is 6. So return 6.

Case4: a=5, b=7 → b >a. Check if b is odd? Yes. So %10 is 1, %11 is 8. Return 8.

So the function returns:

if (b < a) → -1

else if (b == a && b is odd) → -1

else if (b is odd) → b +1

else → b

Wait, but in the code, the else clause of the second if (label 4) is label 9. So when b >=a, but either b !=a or b is even.

Then, in label 9, it checks if b is odd. If yes, return b+1; else, return b.

So the function can be written as:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) {
        return -1;
    } else if (b == a && (b % 2 == 1)) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        if (b % 2 == 1) {
            return b +1;
        } else {
            return b;
        }
    }
}

Alternatively, this can be simplified. Since the else part checks if b is odd, adding 1 if so, else returning b.

So the function could be written more concisely as:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) {
        return -1;
    } else if (b == a && b % 2 == 1) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        return (b % 2 == 1) ? b +1 : b;
    }
}

But looking back at the IR, the else part (label 9) always computes %11 as %1 + %10, where %10 is 0 or 1 based on whether %1 is odd. So regardless of whether it's odd or even, it adds that and returns. So the function returns b if even, b+1 if odd, but only when b >=a and either b !=a or b is even.

Wait, but in the case where b ==a and b is even, the second condition (b ==a and odd) is false, so it proceeds to label 9, where it returns b (since even). So in that case, if a and b are equal and even, it returns b.

So the function's logic is:

- If b < a → return -1
- Else if b == a and b is odd → return -1
- Else, if b is odd → return b +1
- Else → return b

So the code can be written as:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) {
        return -1;
    } else if (b == a && (b % 2) != 0) { // b is odd
        return -1;
    } else {
        if (b % 2 != 0) {
            return b +1;
        } else {
            return b;
        }
    }
}

Alternatively, since the else part can be simplified using the ternary operator.

I think that's the correct translation. Now, I'll write the C++ code accordingly.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into a C++ function, we analyze the control flow and operations. The function `choose_num` takes two integers and returns an integer based on specific conditions.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Function Signature:** The function is named `choose_num` and takes two integers `a` and `b`, returning an integer.

2. **Condition 1:** If `b` is less than `a`, return `-1`.

3. **Condition 2:** If `b` equals `a` and `b` is odd, return `-1`.

4. **Condition 3:** If `b` is odd and greater than or equal to `a`, return `b + 1`.

5. **Default Case:** If none of the above conditions are met, return `b`.

**Decompiled C++ Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) {
        return -1;
    } else if (b == a && (b % 2 != 0)) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        if (b % 2 != 0) {
            return b + 1;
        } else {
            return b;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << choose_num(5, 3) << std::endl;  // Output: -1
    std::cout << choose_num(5, 5) << std::endl;  // Output: -1 (5 is odd)
    std::cout << choose_num(5, 6) << std::endl;  // Output: 6
    std::cout << choose_num(5, 7) << std::endl;  // Output: 8
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the `choose_num` function with the specified logic and includes a `main` function to demonstrate its usage with example cases.
