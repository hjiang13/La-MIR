Okay, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's see what this function is doing.

The function is named `_Z15starts_one_endsi` with an `i32` return type and takes an `i32` parameter. In C++, this would translate to a function like `int starts_one_ends(int)`. 

Looking at the IR, the function starts with some comparisons. It first checks if the input is less than 1. If so, it branches to label 13. Then, it checks if the input is equal to 1 and branches to label 13 again if true. If not, it proceeds to check if the input is greater than 2. If it is, it goes into a loop (label 7), otherwise it goes to label 13.

Inside the loop (label 7), there are two phi nodes. Phi nodes in LLVM IR represent the merging of values from different basic blocks. So, `%8` is the value of `%11` from the loop iteration or 2 on the first iteration. `%9` starts at 18 and gets multiplied by 10 each iteration. Then, `%11` increments `%8` by 1, and it checks if `%11` equals the input. If it does, it exits the loop to label 13; otherwise, it continues looping.

Once the loop exits, it returns a value based on where it exited. If it exited early (like when `a < 1` or `a == 1` or `a <= 2`), it returns 0, 1, or 18 respectively. Otherwise, it returns the result of the loop, which is the multiplied value.

Putting this together, the function returns 0 for inputs less than 1, 1 for 1, 18 for 2, and for numbers greater than 2, it loops from 2 up to `a`, multiplying by 10 each time. So, for `a=3`, it would do 18*10=180, then `a=4` would be 180+1=181, but wait, actually, looking at the loop, it's multiplying the previous value by 10 and adding 1 each time, but I think I might have miscounted.

Wait, in the loop, `%9` starts at 18, then gets multiplied by 10 each time, and `%8` increments by 1. So for each iteration, the value increases by 10 times the previous plus 1. Hmm, maybe it's better to see what the loop does step by step.

For example, if `a` is 3: 
- First iteration: `%8` is 2, `%9` is 18. Then, `%10` is 18*10=180, `%11` is 3. Since 3 == 3, it exits the loop and returns 180.
If `a` is 4:
- First iteration: `%8` is 2, `%9` is 18. `%10` is 180, `%11` is 3. Not equal to 4, so loop again.
- Second iteration: `%8` is 3, `%9` is 180. `%10` is 180*10=1800, `%11` is 4. Now, it's equal, so returns 1800.

Wait, that seems like it's returning 180 for a=3, 1800 for a=4, etc. So the loop is generating a number that starts at 18 and appends a digit (the current count) each time. So for a=3, it's 18*10 + 3? Wait, no, because 18*10 is 180, which is 18 followed by 0, but here it's 180, which is 18*10. So maybe it's just multiplying by 10 each time, not appending digits. 

Wait, the function is called "starts_one_ends", which suggests it might be building a number that starts with 1 and ends with the input. But looking at the code, it starts at 2 and increments, but the initial value is 18. Maybe it's generating a number that starts with 18 and appends digits up to `a`. But I'm not entirely sure, but the code seems to handle that.

So, translating all this into C++, the function would look like this: handle the cases where `a` is less than 1, equal to 1, or less than or equal to 2, then loop from 2 up to `a`, multiplying by 10 each time and adding the current value. Finally, return the computed result.

Here is the decompiled C++ code based on the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
int starts_one_ends(int a) {
    if (a < 1) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (a == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    if (a > 2) {
        int val1 = 2;
        int val2 = 18;
        while (true) {
            val2 = val2 * 10;
            val1 += 1;
            if (val1 == a) {
                return val2;
            }
        }
    }
    return 18;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `starts_one_ends` takes an integer `a` and returns an integer.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `a` is less than 1, return 0.
   - If `a` is exactly 1, return 1.
   - If `a` is greater than 2, proceed to the loop.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - Initialize `val1` to 2 and `val2` to 18.
   - Multiply `val2` by 10 and increment `val1` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Continue the loop until `val1` equals `a`, then return `val2`.

4. **Return Statement**: If `a` is 2, return 18 directly without entering the loop.

This code should replicate the behavior described by the provided LLVM IR.
