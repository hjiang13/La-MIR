Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at the IR code, I see it's a function named `_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which is mangled. Using a demangler, that should translate to something like `smallest_change(std::vector<int>)`.

The function takes a `std::vector<int>` as an argument. Looking at the IR, it seems to be doing some pointer manipulations. The vector's internal pointers are being accessed, probably the begin, end, and size pointers.

In the IR, there's a loop starting at label 14. It looks like it's iterating through the vector's elements. The loop compares consecutive elements and counts how many times they are different. The count is accumulated in `%13`, which is returned at the end.

Wait, let me check the loop. It starts with some initializations and then in each iteration, it loads two consecutive elements, compares them, and increments the count if they're different. The loop continues until it has checked all consecutive pairs.

So putting it all together, the function counts the number of times consecutive elements in the vector are different. Therefore, the original C++ function probably returns the number of adjacent differing elements.

I should write a C++ function that takes a vector, iterates through it, and counts the differences between consecutive elements. That should match the IR's behavior.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code to C++ source code, we'll analyze the IR and translate it into equivalent C++ constructs.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**: The IR defines a function `@_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` which demangles to `smallest_change(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int>>)`.

2. **Function Behavior**: The function accesses the vector's internal pointers (begin, end, and size) and iterates through elements, comparing consecutive values. It counts how many times consecutive elements differ.

3. **Loop Structure**: The loop starts at label 14, initializing counters and indices. For each element, it loads the current and next elements, compares them, and increments the count if they are different.

4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until all consecutive pairs have been checked. The count is then returned.

### Decompiled C++ Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int smallest_change(const vector<int>& v) {
    int count = 0;
    unsigned long size = v.size();
    if (size == 0) return 0;
    
    for (unsigned long i = 0; i < size - 1; ++i) {
        if (v[i] != v[i+1]) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Function Signature**: The function `smallest_change` takes a `const vector<int>&` to avoid copying the vector.
- **Edge Case Handling**: If the vector is empty, it returns 0 immediately.
- **Loop Through Elements**: Using a for loop, it iterates from the first to the second last element.
- **Comparison and Counting**: For each consecutive pair of elements, it checks if they are different and increments the count if true.
- **Return Count**: The total count of differing consecutive elements is returned.

This C++ code accurately reflects the behavior of the provided LLVM IR.
