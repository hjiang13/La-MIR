Alright, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by carefully analyzing the IR code provided.

First, looking at the function definition:
```
define dso_local i32 @_Z8sum_to_ni(i32 %0) local_unnamed_addr #0 {
```
The function is named `_Z8sum_to_ni` and takes an `i32` parameter `%0`. I know that in C++ name mangling, this likely corresponds to a function named `sum_to_n`. The `i32` return type suggests it returns an integer.

Next, I'll go through the function body step by step.

1. `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`: This instruction adds 1 to the input parameter `%0` and stores the result in `%2`. So, if the input is `n`, this calculates `n + 1`.

2. `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`: This multiplies `%2` (which is `n + 1`) by `%0` (which is `n`), storing the result in `%3`. So, this step computes `(n + 1) * n`.

3. `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`: This performs a signed division of `%3` by 2, storing the result in `%4`. So, the result is `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`.

4. `ret i32 %4`: Returns the value in `%4`, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

Putting it all together, the function calculates the sum of the first `n` integers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`.

Now, I'll translate this logic into C++. The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` and returns the sum. Considering the IR's attributes, it's a simple function without any side effects, so I'll declare it as `inline` for potential optimization.

I should also ensure that the function handles cases where `n` might be negative, but since the IR uses `add nsw` and `mul nsw`, which imply no signed wrap, and `sdiv` for division, the function expects `n` to be a positive integer as per the problem's context.

Finally, I'll write the C++ code, including a `main` function to test it with an example, ensuring it's a complete and runnable program.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Function and Its Operations**:
   - The function `@_Z8sum_to_ni` is the mangled name for a function named `sum_to_n`.
   - It takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer.

2. **Understand the Operations**:
   - The function computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`.

3. **Translate to C++**:
   - Write a function `sum_to_n` that implements this formula.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

inline int sum_to_n(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example value
    std::cout << "Sum of first " << n << " natural numbers: " << sum_to_n(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the `sum_to_n` function and includes a `main` function to demonstrate its usage. You can compile and run this program to see the result.
