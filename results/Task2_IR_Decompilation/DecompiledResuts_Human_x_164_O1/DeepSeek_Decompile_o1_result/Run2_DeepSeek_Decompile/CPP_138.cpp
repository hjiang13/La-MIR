Okay, I have this LLVM IR code that I need to decompile into C or C++. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing. 

Looking at the function definition, it's a function called _Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni which takes an integer and returns a boolean. The name suggests it might be checking if the number is even and meets some other condition.

The IR code does a few things step by step. First, it uses %2 = and i32 %0, 1. That's a bitwise AND with 1, so it's checking the least significant bit. If the result is 0, then the number is even because the last bit is 0.

Then, %3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0. This is comparing if the result of the AND is equal to zero, which would mean the number is even.

Next, %4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7. This checks if the input is greater than 7. So, the function is not just checking evenness but also if the number is greater than 7.

Finally, %5 = and i1 %4, %3. This combines the two conditions. The function returns true only if both conditions are met: the number is even and greater than 7. So, it's returning true if the input is an even number greater than 7.

Putting this together, the C++ function should take an integer and return a boolean. The conditions are straightforward: check if the number is even and if it's greater than 7, then return true if both are true, else false.

I should make sure to handle the conditions correctly and return the appropriate boolean value. Testing some examples would help confirm. For instance, input 8 should return true, 7 should return false, and 6 should also return false because even though it's even, it's not greater than 7.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we'll analyze the function and translate it step by step.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer parameter and returns a boolean.
   - The name suggests it checks if a number meets certain conditions related to being even.

2. **Bitwise AND Operation**:
   - `%2 = and i32 %0, 1` checks the least significant bit of the input. If the result is 0, the number is even.

3. **Comparison for Evenness**:
   - `%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0` checks if the result of the AND operation is zero, indicating an even number.

4. **Greater Than Check**:
   - `%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7` checks if the input number is greater than 7.

5. **Combine Conditions**:
   - `%5 = and i1 %4, %3` combines both conditions using a logical AND. The function returns `true` only if both conditions are met.

### Decompiled C++ Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int num) {
    bool is_even = (num & 1) == 0;
    bool is_greater_than_7 = num > 7;
    return is_even && is_greater_than_7;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    cout << boolalpha; // Print 'true' or 'false' instead of 1 or 0
    cout << "Is 8 even and greater than 7? " << is_equal_to_sum_even(8) << endl;  // Output: true
    cout << "Is 7 even and greater than 7? " << is_equal_to_sum_even(7) << endl;  // Output: false
    cout << "Is 6 even and greater than 7? " << is_equal_to_sum_even(6) << endl;  // Output: false
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code defines a function `is_equal_to_sum_even` that returns `true` if the input number is both even and greater than 7. The `main` function demonstrates example usage with different inputs.
