Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code is doing. 

Looking at the function definition, it's a function named @_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi. I think that's a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find that it translates to add_elements(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int>>*, int). So the function takes a vector of integers and an integer, and returns an integer.

The function starts with an icmp instruction checking if %1 (the integer argument) is greater than 0. If it is, it branches to label 4, otherwise to label 8. Label 8 seems to be the exit point where it returns a value.

In label 4, it gets the element pointer of the vector. It loads the data pointer of the vector, which is the actual array. Then it zeros extends the integer %1 to a 64-bit value, which I think is because we'll be using it as an index.

Label 10 is a loop. It has phi nodes for %11 and %12, which are initializing to 0. %11 is the loop index, and %12 is the sum being accumulated.

In each iteration, it gets the element from the vector at the current index, adds 99 to it, checks if it's less than 199. If so, it keeps the value; otherwise, it selects 0. It adds this value to the sum and increments the index. It loops until the index reaches %7, which is the number of elements.

Putting it all together, the function iterates through the first %1 elements of the vector, adds 99 to each, checks if the result is less than 199, and accumulates the sum of those elements that meet the condition.

So the C++ code should create a function that does this. It starts by checking if the input number is positive. Then it loops through that many elements, adds 99, and sums those under 199.

I should write the code with a for loop, using the vector's data pointer for direct access. The sum starts at 0, and each iteration processes the current element as described.

I think that's the logic. Now I'll write the C++ code that matches this behavior.

The given LLVM IR code can be translated back into C++ source code. Here's the decompiled version of the code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int add_elements(vector<int>* vec, int num_elements) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; ++i) {
        int value = vec->data()[i];
        int added = value + 99;
        if (added < 199) {
            sum += value;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function `add_elements` takes a pointer to a `vector<int>` and an integer `num_elements`.
- It initializes a sum variable to 0.
- It iterates through the first `num_elements` of the vector.
- For each element, it adds 99 to the element's value.
- If the resulting value is less than 199, it adds the original value to the sum.
- Finally, it returns the computed sum.

You can use this function by passing a vector and specifying how many elements to process.
