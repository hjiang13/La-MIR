Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's see what this function does.

The function is called _Z15is_simple_powerii, which I think translates to something like is_simple_power(int, int) in C++. The function returns a boolean (i1 in IR). 

Looking at the IR, the function starts by checking if the first argument (%0) is greater than 0. Then it checks if it's greater than 1. If it is, it goes into a loop, otherwise it goes to the exit block.

In the loop, it's using phi nodes to track the values of %6 and %7. It seems like %7 is being multiplied by %1 each time, and %6 is incrementing by 1. So %7 is like a running product, starting from 1 and multiplying by %1 each iteration. %6 is the loop counter, starting from 0 and incrementing each time.

There's a check if %8 (which is %7 * %1) is less than or equal to %0. If that's true and %6 is less than 99, it continues the loop. Otherwise, it checks if %8 equals %0, which would mean %0 is a power of %1.

If the initial %0 is 0 or 1, the function handles those cases without entering the loop.

Putting it all together, the function returns whether %0 is a power of %1, but only up to a certain exponent (since it stops at 99). So, I'll translate this into a C++ function with a loop that checks each power step, ensuring it doesn't run more than 99 times.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the logic and translate it back into a function.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_simple_power(int base, int power) {
    if (base <= 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (base == 1) {
        return true;
    }

    int result = 1;
    int i = 0;
    while (true) {
        result = result * power;
        if (result > base) {
            return false;
        }
        if (result == base) {
            return true;
        }
        if (i >= 99) { // Prevent infinite loops
            return false;
        }
        i++;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << is_simple_power(8, 2) << std::endl;  // Should print: true
    std::cout << is_simple_power(10, 2) << std::endl; // Should print: false
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Function `is_simple_power`**:
  - Checks if `base` is less than or equal to 0 and returns `false` if so.
  - Returns `true` if `base` is 1, as any number to the power of 0 is 1.
  - Uses a loop to multiply `power` repeatedly, checking if the product matches `base`.
  - Includes a safety check to prevent infinite loops by limiting iterations to 99.

- **Example Usage**:
  - Demonstrates how to use the function with sample inputs, printing the results.

This code should compile and run correctly, providing the expected functionality based on the original IR.
