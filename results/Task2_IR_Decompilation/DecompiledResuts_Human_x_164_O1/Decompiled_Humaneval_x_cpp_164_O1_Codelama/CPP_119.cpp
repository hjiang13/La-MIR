I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. However, I can provide you with some general tips on how to decompile IR code:

1. Use a tool like llvm-dis to convert the IR code into assembly code. This will make it easier to read and understand the code.
2. Look for patterns in the code that indicate the presence of loops, conditionals, and other control flow structures. These patterns can help you identify the overall structure of the code.
3. Use a tool like objdump to disassemble the code and see the assembly code. This can help you understand the low-level details of the code and how it maps to the IR code.
4. Use a tool like IDA Pro to decompile the code and see the original source code. This can help you understand how the code was written and what it does.
5. Use a tool like GDB to debug the code and see how it behaves when it is executed. This can help you understand the behavior of the code and identify any bugs or issues.

I hope these tips are helpful in decompiling the provided IR code. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, please let me know.
