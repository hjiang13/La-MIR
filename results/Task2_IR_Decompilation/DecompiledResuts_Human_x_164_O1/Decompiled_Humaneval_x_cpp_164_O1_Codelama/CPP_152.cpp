I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand.

However, I can tell you that the IR code you provided is likely in a binary format, which is not human-readable. To decompile it, you would need to use a tool that can convert the binary code into assembly code or C code.

If you have access to the original source code, you can try using a decompiler to convert the binary code into C code. However, keep in mind that the resulting code may not be identical to the original source code, and it may not be easy to read or understand.

If you do not have access to the original source code, you may need to use a disassembler to convert the binary code into assembly code. This can be a time-consuming and complex process, and the resulting assembly code may not be easy to read or understand.

In any case, I would recommend that you consult with a professional reverse engineer or a security expert who has experience with decompilation and disassembly. They will be able to provide you with more detailed information and guidance on how to proceed.
