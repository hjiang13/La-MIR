The provided IR code is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string has balanced parentheses. The function is implemented using a loop that iterates over the characters of the input string and increments or decrements a counter for each opening or closing parenthesis, respectively. If the counter becomes negative at any point, the function returns false. If the loop completes and the counter is not zero, the function also returns false. Otherwise, the function returns true.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <string>

bool strlen(std::string str) {
    int len = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        if (str[i] == '(') {
            len++;
        } else if (str[i] == ')') {
            len--;
        }
        if (len < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return len == 0;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ source code, but it should have the same behavior and logic.
