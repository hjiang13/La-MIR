I am not able to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code you provided appears to be in a binary format, which I am not able to read or interpret.

To decompile the IR code, I would need the IR code to be in a human-readable format, such as text. Additionally, I would need to know the specific format of the IR code, as there are many different types of IR code and each one has its own specific syntax and structure.

If you are able to provide the IR code in a human-readable format, I would be happy to try to decompile it for you. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can do to help.
