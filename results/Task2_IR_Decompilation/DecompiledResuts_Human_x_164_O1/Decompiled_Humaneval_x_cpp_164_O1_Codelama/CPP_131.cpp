I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code because it is not in a format that I can understand.

However, I can tell you that the IR code you provided is likely in the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) format, which is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program. It is used by the LLVM compiler infrastructure to represent the program being compiled or optimized.

To decompile the IR code, you would need to use a tool that can convert the IR code back into a human-readable format, such as C or C++ source code. One such tool is the "llvm-ir" tool, which is part of the LLVM project. You can use this tool to convert the IR code back into C or C++ source code, like this:
```
llvm-ir -S -o output.cpp input.ll
```
This command would take the IR code in the "input.ll" file and convert it back into C++ source code in the "output.cpp" file.

Alternatively, you can use the "llvm-dis" tool to disassemble the IR code back into assembly code, like this:
```
llvm-dis -o output.s input.ll
```
This command would take the IR code in the "input.ll" file and convert it back into assembly code in the "output.s" file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
