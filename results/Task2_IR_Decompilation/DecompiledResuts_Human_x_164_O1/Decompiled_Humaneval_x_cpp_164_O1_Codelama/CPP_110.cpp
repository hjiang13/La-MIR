I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. Additionally, decompilation of IR code is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of the underlying architecture and the specific optimizations that were applied during compilation.

However, I can suggest some resources that may be helpful in understanding the process of decompilation and the tools that can be used for this purpose:

1. The LLVM documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the LLVM IR format and the tools that can be used for decompilation, such as the llvm-dis tool.
2. The Decompilation Wiki is a community-driven resource that provides information on various decompilation techniques and tools.
3. The README file for the RetDec decompiler provides an overview of the decompilation process and the tools that are used in the RetDec framework.

It is important to note that decompilation is a complex process that may not always produce accurate results, especially for optimized code. Therefore, it is recommended to use multiple tools and techniques to verify the accuracy of the decompiled code.
