The provided IR code is a low-level representation of a C++ function that checks whether a given string of brackets is correctly balanced. The function takes a single argument of type `string` and returns a value of type `bool`.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <string>

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int x) {
  int y = x & 1;
  if (y == 0) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
The decompiled code is a simple function that takes an integer `x` as an argument and returns `true` if `x` is even, and `false` otherwise. The function uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to check whether the least significant bit of `x` is set to 0, which indicates that `x` is even.

Note that the decompiled code is not the original source code that was used to generate the IR code, but rather a simplified version that preserves the program logic. The original source code may have included additional comments, annotations, or other information that is not present in the decompiled code.
