I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code provided is not in a format that I can recognize or process.

However, I can tell you that the IR code is likely to be in a binary format, which is not human-readable. To decompile it, you would need to use a tool that can reverse-engineer the binary code and convert it into assembly code or C/C++ source code.

There are several tools available that can perform this task, such as IDA Pro, OllyDbg, and GDB. These tools can help you to analyze the binary code, identify the functions and data structures, and generate a disassembly listing that you can use to understand the code.

Alternatively, if you have access to the source code that was used to generate the binary code, you can use a tool like GCC or Clang to compile the source code and generate the binary code. This will allow you to see the assembly code and C/C++ source code that was generated by the compiler.

I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions, please let me know.
