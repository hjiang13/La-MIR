I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. However, I can provide you with some general tips on how to decompile IR code.

1. First, you need to understand the structure of the IR code. The IR code is organized into functions, which are further divided into basic blocks. Each basic block contains a sequence of instructions.
2. Next, you need to identify the entry point of the function. This is usually indicated by the "entry" label.
3. Once you have identified the entry point, you can start decompiling the code. You can use a disassembler tool to help you with this process.
4. As you decompile the code, you may encounter instructions that are not easily recognizable. In such cases, you can use a reference guide to understand what the instruction does.
5. Finally, you can use a decompiler tool to help you with the decompilation process. These tools can help you generate C or C++ code from the IR code.

Please note that decompiling IR code can be a complex and time-consuming process. It requires a good understanding of the underlying architecture and the IR code itself. If you are not familiar with the IR code, it may be helpful to consult with someone who is familiar with it.
