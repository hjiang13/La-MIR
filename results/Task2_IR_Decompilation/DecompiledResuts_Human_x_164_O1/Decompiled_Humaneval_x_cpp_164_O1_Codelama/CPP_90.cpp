I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI, I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code you provided is in a binary format, and I am programmed to understand and process text-based input.

However, I can suggest some possible ways to decompile the IR code. One option is to use a tool such as the LLVM IR decompiler, which can convert the binary IR code into a human-readable format. Another option is to use a disassembler to convert the binary code into assembly code, which can then be manually converted into C or C++ source code.

It's important to note that decompiling code can be a complex and time-consuming process, and the resulting code may not be identical to the original source code. Additionally, decompiling code can raise legal and ethical concerns, as it may involve reverse-engineering proprietary software or intellectual property. Therefore, it's important to ensure that any decompilation activities are done in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and with the necessary permissions and approvals.
