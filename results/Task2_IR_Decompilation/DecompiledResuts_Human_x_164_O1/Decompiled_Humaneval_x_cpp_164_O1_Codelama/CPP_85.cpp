The provided IR code is for a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be a simple loop that iterates over the elements of the vector, performs some arithmetic operations on the elements, and returns the result.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int add(vector<int> &v) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
    sum += v[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original source code, but it should be functionally equivalent. The decompiled code uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the vector, whereas the original source code uses a while loop with a manual increment. The decompiled code also uses the `size()` method to get the size of the vector, whereas the original source code uses a hardcoded value.

It's worth noting that the decompiled code is not optimized, and it may not be as efficient as the original source code. The decompiler is not able to perform optimizations, and it may not be able to generate code that is as efficient as the original source code.
