```

The provided IR code is a function that takes a single floating-point argument and returns a floating-point value. The function appears to be a truncation function, which rounds the input value down to the nearest integer.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code:
```
float truncate_number(float x) {
    int y = (int)x;
    return x - y;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not the original C++ source code, but rather a reimplementation of the function in C++. The decompiled code is functionally equivalent to the original code, but it may not have the same performance characteristics or error handling.
