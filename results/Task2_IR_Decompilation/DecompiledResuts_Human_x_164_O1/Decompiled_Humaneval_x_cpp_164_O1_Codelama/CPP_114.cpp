The provided IR code is a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the minimum sum of any subarray. The function is implemented using a sliding window approach, where the window size is determined by the number of elements in the vector.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int minSubArraySum(vector<int> nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int minSum = INT_MAX;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
        if (sum < minSum) {
            minSum = sum;
        }
        if (sum > 0) {
            sum = 0;
        }
    }
    return minSum;
}
```
The function first initializes the minimum sum to the maximum possible value, and then iterates through the vector. At each iteration, it adds the current element to the sum, and if the sum is less than the minimum sum, it updates the minimum sum. If the sum is greater than 0, it resets the sum to 0.

The function then returns the minimum sum.

Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code, as the IR code does not include the vector type and the function name. However, the logic of the function remains the same.
