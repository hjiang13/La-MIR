I will do my best to decompile the provided IR code into equivalent C or C++ source code. Please note that the decompilation process may not always produce perfect or complete results, and some manual adjustments may be necessary to obtain a fully functional program.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code based on the provided IR code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class vector {
public:
    struct _Vector_base {
        struct _Vector_impl {
            int* _M_start;
            int* _M_finish;
            int* _M_end_of_storage;
        } _M_impl;
    } _M_start;

    vector() {
        _M_start._M_impl._M_start = nullptr;
        _M_start._M_impl._M_finish = nullptr;
        _M_start._M_impl._M_end_of_storage = nullptr;
    }

    void _M_realloc_insert(int* position, int value) {
        int* new_start = new int[2 * (_M_start._M_impl._M_finish - _M_start._M_impl._M_start)];
        int* new_finish = new_start;
        for (int* i = _M_start._M_impl._M_start; i != position; ++i) {
            *new_finish++ = *i;
        }
        *new_finish++ = value;
        for (int* i = position; i != _M_start._M_impl._M_finish; ++i) {
            *new_finish++ = *i;
        }
        delete[] _M_start._M_impl._M_start;
        _M_start._M_impl._M_start = new_start;
        _M_start._M_impl._M_finish = new_finish;
        _M_start._M_impl._M_end_of_storage = new_start + 2 * (_M_start._M_impl._M_finish - _M_start._M_impl._M_start);
    }
};

int factorize(int n) {
    vector v;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            v._M_realloc_insert(v._M_start._M_impl._M_finish, i);
            n /= i;
            i = 1;
        }
    }
    return v._M_start._M_impl._M_finish - v._M_start._M_impl._M_start;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << factorize(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code may contain some errors or inefficiencies, and may not be fully functional or optimized. It is always a good idea to review and test the decompiled code thoroughly before using it in any production environment.
