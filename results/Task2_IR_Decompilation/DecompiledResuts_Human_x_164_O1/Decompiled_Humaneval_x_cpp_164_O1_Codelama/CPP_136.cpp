I am unable to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code appears to be in a binary format, which I am not able to process.

To decompile the IR code, I would need access to the original source code or a human-readable version of the IR code. Additionally, I would need to know the specific compiler and version that was used to generate the IR code, as different compilers may produce different IR code.

If you have access to the original source code or a human-readable version of the IR code, I would be happy to try to decompile it for you. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.
