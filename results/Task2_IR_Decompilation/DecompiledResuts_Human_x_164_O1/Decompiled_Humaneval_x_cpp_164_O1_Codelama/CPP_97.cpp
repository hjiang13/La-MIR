The provided IR code is a function named `_Z8multiplyii` that takes two `i32` arguments and returns an `i32` value. The function is defined as follows:
```
define dso_local i32 @_Z8multiplyii(i32 %0, i32 %1) local_unnamed_addr #0 {
  %3 = call i32 @llvm.abs.i32(i32 %0, i1 true)
  %4 = urem i32 %3, 10
  %5 = call i32 @llvm.abs.i32(i32 %1, i1 true)
  %6 = urem i32 %5, 10
  %7 = mul nuw nsw i32 %6, %4
  ret i32 %7
}
```
The function takes two arguments, `%0` and `%1`, which are both `i32` values. The function first calls the `llvm.abs.i32` intrinsic on both arguments, which computes the absolute value of the arguments. The resulting values are then used to compute the remainder of the division by 10 using the `urem` instruction. The two remainders are then multiplied together using the `mul` instruction with the `nuw` and `nsw` flags set, which means that the multiplication is performed with unsigned integers and the result is truncated to the width of the `i32` type. Finally, the function returns the result of the multiplication.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int multiply(int a, int b) {
  int result = 0;
  int absA = abs(a);
  int absB = abs(b);
  int remainderA = absA % 10;
  int remainderB = absB % 10;
  result = remainderB * remainderA;
  return result;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code, but it is functionally equivalent. The decompiled code uses the `abs` function from the C standard library to compute the absolute value of the arguments, while the original code uses the `llvm.abs.i32` intrinsic. Additionally, the decompiled code uses the `%` operator to compute the remainder of the division by 10, while the original code uses the `urem` instruction.
