Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <vector>

class std::vector {
public:
    struct _Vector_base {
        struct _Vector_impl {
            float* _M_start;
            float* _M_finish;
            float* _M_end_of_storage;
        } _M_impl;
    } _M_start;
};

bool monotonic(std::vector<float> &v) {
    float* start = v._M_start._M_impl._M_start;
    float* finish = v._M_start._M_impl._M_finish;
    float* end_of_storage = v._M_start._M_impl._M_end_of_storage;

    int64_t size = (int64_t)((uint64_t)finish - (uint64_t)start);
    int64_t half_size = size / 2;

    int32_t i = 0;
    int32_t j = 0;
    int32_t k = 0;

    while (i < half_size) {
        float a = start[i];
        float b = start[size - i - 1];
        if (a > b) {
            j = i + 1;
            k = size - i - 1;
            while (j < k) {
                float c = start[j];
                float d = start[k];
                if (c > d) {
                    return false;
                }
                j++;
                k--;
            }
        }
        i++;
    }

    return true;
}

Note that the decompiled code may not be exactly the same as the original source code, as the IR code may have been optimized or transformed in various ways during compilation. However, the decompiled code should be functionally equivalent to the original source code.
