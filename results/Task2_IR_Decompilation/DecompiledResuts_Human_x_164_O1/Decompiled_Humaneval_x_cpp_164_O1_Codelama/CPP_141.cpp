I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a valid format. The IR code should be in a human-readable format, with each instruction on a separate line and indented appropriately. Additionally, the code should include the necessary metadata, such as the module ID and the target triple.

If you have access to the original source code, I would recommend using a decompiler to generate the C or C++ source code. If you do not have access to the original source code, you may be able to use a disassembler to generate assembly code, which could then be manually converted to C or C++. However, this process can be time-consuming and may not produce accurate results.

It's also worth noting that decompilation is not always possible, especially if the original code was compiled with optimizations enabled. In some cases, the decompiled code may not be able to be compiled or may produce different behavior than the original code.
