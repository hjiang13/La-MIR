I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code because it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code you provided appears to be in a binary format, which I cannot read or interpret.

To decompile the IR code, I would need access to the original source code or a human-readable version of the IR code. Alternatively, you can use a tool such as the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) viewer to view the IR code in a human-readable format.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.
