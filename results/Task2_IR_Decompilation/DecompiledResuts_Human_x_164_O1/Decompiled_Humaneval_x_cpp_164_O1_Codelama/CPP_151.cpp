The provided IR code is for a function that takes a vector of floats as input and returns a double value. The function appears to be computing the difference between the first and last elements of the vector, and then rounding the result to the nearest integer. The rounded result is then converted to a double and returned.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>

double double_the_difference(std::vector<float> &v) {
  float first = v[0];
  float last = v[v.size() - 1];
  float diff = last - first;
  float rounded = std::round(diff);
  return static_cast<double>(rounded);
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original source code, as the decompiler has made some assumptions about the types and functions used in the code. However, the decompiled code should be functionally equivalent to the original code.
