The provided IR code is for a function that takes an integer argument and returns an integer value. The function appears to be a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, with a base case of 0 or 1 and a recursive case that adds the previous two values.

Here is the decompiled C code for the provided IR code:
```
int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not optimized, and it may not be the most efficient implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. Additionally, the decompiled code may not be exactly the same as the original source code, as the IR code may have been modified or optimized during the compilation process.
