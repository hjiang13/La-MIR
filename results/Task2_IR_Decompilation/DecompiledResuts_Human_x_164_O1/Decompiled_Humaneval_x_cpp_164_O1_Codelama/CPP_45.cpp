```

The provided IR code is a function that takes two float arguments and returns a float value. The function is defined as follows:
```
define dso_local float @_Z13triangle_areaff(float %0, float %1) local_unnamed_addr #0 {
  %3 = fmul float %0, %1
  %4 = fmul float %3, 5.000000e-01
  ret float %4
}
```
The function name is `_Z13triangle_areaff`, which is a mangled name that includes the function's parameters and return type. The function takes two float arguments, `%0` and `%1`, and returns a float value.

The function body consists of three instructions:

1. `%3 = fmul float %0, %1`: This instruction multiplies the two float arguments and stores the result in `%3`.
2. `%4 = fmul float %3, 5.000000e-01`: This instruction multiplies the result of the previous instruction by a constant value of `5.000000e-01` and stores the result in `%4`.
3. `ret float %4`: This instruction returns the value stored in `%4` as the function's return value.

Based on the provided IR code, the corresponding C++ source code would be:
```
float triangle_area(float base, float height) {
  return (base * height) * 5.000000e-01;
}
```
Note that the function name and parameters have been demangled to their original names, and the constant value has been converted to its decimal representation.
