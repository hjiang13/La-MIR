Sure, I can help you with that. The provided IR code is in LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) format, which is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program. To decompile the IR code into equivalent C or C++ source code, we can use a decompiler tool such as "llvm-ir" or "llvm-dis".

Here's an example of how to use "llvm-ir" to decompile the provided IR code:
```bash
$ llvm-ir -S -o output.c input.ll
```
This will generate a C source file called "output.c" that contains the decompiled code.

Alternatively, we can use "llvm-dis" to generate an assembly file that contains the decompiled code:
```bash
$ llvm-dis -o output.s input.ll
```
This will generate an assembly file called "output.s" that contains the decompiled code.

Note that the decompiled code may not be exactly the same as the original source code, as the decompiler may not be able to recover all of the original source code's details. However, the decompiled code should be functionally equivalent to the original code.
