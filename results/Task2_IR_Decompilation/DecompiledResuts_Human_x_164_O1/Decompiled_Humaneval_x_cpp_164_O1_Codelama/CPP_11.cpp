I am not able to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code you provided appears to be in a binary format, which I am not able to read or interpret.

To decompile the IR code, I would need the IR code to be in a human-readable format, such as text. Additionally, I would need to know the specific architecture and operating system that the code was compiled for, as well as any other relevant information about the code.

If you are able to provide the IR code in a human-readable format and provide the necessary information about the code, I would be happy to try to decompile it for you.
