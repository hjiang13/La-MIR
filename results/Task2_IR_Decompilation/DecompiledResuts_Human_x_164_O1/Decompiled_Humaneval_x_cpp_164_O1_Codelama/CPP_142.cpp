The provided IR code is a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the elements in the vector. The function is implemented using a loop that iterates over the elements of the vector and computes the sum of the squares.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int sum_squares(vector<int> &v) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
    sum += v[i] * v[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code, but it is functionally equivalent. The differences are due to the way the IR code is structured and the optimizations that the compiler has applied.
