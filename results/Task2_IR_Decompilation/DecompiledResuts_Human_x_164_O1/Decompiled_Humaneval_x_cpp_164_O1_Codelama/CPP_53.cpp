The provided IR code is a LLVM IR representation of a C++ function named `_Z3addii` that takes two `i32` arguments and returns an `i32` value. The function is defined as `dso_local` and has several attributes such as `mustprogress`, `nofree`, `norecurse`, `nosync`, `nounwind`, `readnone`, `uwtable`, and `willreturn`.

The function body consists of a single `add` instruction that adds the two input arguments and returns the result.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code:
```
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is in C++ syntax, but the function name and signature are not necessarily valid C++. The decompiled code is intended to be a rough approximation of the original source code, and may not be compilable or runnable as-is.
