The provided IR code is for a function that takes two vectors of integers as input and returns a vector of integers. The function appears to be incrementing the elements of the first vector by the corresponding elements of the second vector, and then returning the result.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> incr_list(std::vector<int> list1, std::vector<int> list2) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < list1.size(); i++) {
        result.push_back(list1[i] + list2[i]);
    }
    return result;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly equivalent to the original IR code, as the IR code contains some additional instructions that are not necessary for the function's behavior. However, the decompiled code should produce the same output as the original function for any given input.
