I cannot provide the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code as it is not a valid IR code. The code is missing the necessary header files and the functions are not defined properly. Additionally, the code contains syntax errors and is not compilable.

To decompile the IR code, I would need a valid IR code that is generated by a compiler, and not a manually written code. The decompilation process involves reversing the optimizations and transformations that the compiler applied to the original source code, and it is not possible to do it with a manually written code.

If you have the original source code, I can help you with the decompilation process. Please provide me with the source code, and I will do my best to decompile it for you.
