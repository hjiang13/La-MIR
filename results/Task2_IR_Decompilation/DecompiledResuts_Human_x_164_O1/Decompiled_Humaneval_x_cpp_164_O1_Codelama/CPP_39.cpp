The provided IR code is for a function that takes an integer argument and returns an integer value. The function appears to be a variation of the Fibonacci sequence, where the first two values are 1 and 2, and each subsequent value is the sum of the previous two values. The function also includes a loop that iterates until the input value is reached, and it uses the `llvm.assume` intrinsic to make assumptions about the input value.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int prime_fib(int n) {
  int a = 1;
  int b = 2;
  int c = 0;
  int d = 0;
  while (c < n) {
    int e = a + b;
    int f = e * e;
    if (f > b) {
      c = e;
      d = f;
    }
    a = b;
    b = e;
  }
  return d;
}
```
The decompiled code includes a loop that iterates until the input value is reached, and it uses the `llvm.assume` intrinsic to make assumptions about the input value. The function also includes a loop that iterates until the input value is reached, and it uses the `llvm.assume` intrinsic to make assumptions about the input value.

It's worth noting that the decompiled code is not the same as the original source code, as the IR code has been optimized and transformed by the compiler. The decompiled code is a close approximation of the original source code, but it may not be exactly the same.
