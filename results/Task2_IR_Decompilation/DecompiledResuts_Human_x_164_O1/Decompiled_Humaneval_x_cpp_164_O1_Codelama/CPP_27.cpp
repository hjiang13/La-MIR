Sure, I can help you with that. The provided IR code is for a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. The function appears to be checking whether the string has balanced parentheses or not.

Here's the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool filp_case(string s) {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < s.length()) {
        if (s[i] >= 'A' && s[i] <= 'Z') {
            s[i] = s[i] + 32;
        } else if (s[i] >= 'a' && s[i] <= 'z') {
            s[i] = s[i] - 32;
        }
        i++;
    }
    return s;
}
```
The function takes a string as input and iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an uppercase letter, it adds 32 to the ASCII value of the character to convert it to lowercase. If the character is a lowercase letter, it subtracts 32 from the ASCII value of the character to convert it to uppercase. The function returns the modified string.

Note that the decompiled code is not the original source code, but it should give you an idea of what the function does.
