The provided IR code is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. The function checks if the string has balanced brackets or not.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool correct_bracketing(string brackets) {
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < brackets.length(); i++) {
        if (brackets[i] == '(') {
            level++;
        } else if (brackets[i] == ')') {
            level--;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    if (level != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
The decompiled code is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. The function checks if the string has balanced brackets or not. It does this by keeping track of the number of opening and closing brackets in the string. If the number of opening and closing brackets is not equal, or if there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, the function returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
