The provided IR code is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. The function checks if the string has balanced parentheses, meaning that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis, and that the parentheses are properly nested.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
#include <string>

bool is_nested(std::string str) {
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        if (str[i] == '(') {
            level++;
        } else if (str[i] == ')') {
            level--;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return level == 0;
}
```
The decompiled code is similar to the original C++ code, with a few minor differences. The function takes a `std::string` as input, and returns a `bool` value indicating whether the string has balanced parentheses. The function uses a `level` variable to keep track of the current nesting level, and increments or decrements the level based on the characters in the string. If the level ever becomes negative, the function returns `false`, indicating that the string has unbalanced parentheses. If the function reaches the end of the string and the level is still zero, the function returns `true`, indicating that the string has balanced parentheses.
