The provided IR code is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a valid sequence of brackets. The function checks if the brackets in the string are balanced and if they are closed in the correct order.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <string>

bool is_happy(std::string str) {
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        if (str[i] == '(') {
            level++;
        } else if (str[i] == ')') {
            level--;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return level == 0;
}
```
The decompiled code is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a valid sequence of brackets. The function checks if the brackets in the string are balanced and if they are closed in the correct order.

It's worth noting that the decompiled code is not the only possible implementation of the function, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the compiler and the optimization level used.
