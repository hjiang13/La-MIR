I cannot provide a decompiled version of the provided IR code as it is not a valid LLVM IR code. The code is missing the necessary metadata and structure to be a valid LLVM IR module. Additionally, the code contains several syntax errors and undefined references, which would make it impossible to decompile even if it were a valid LLVM IR module.

To decompile an LLVM IR module, you would need to use a tool such as `llvm-dis` or `llvm-ir-decompiler`. These tools can take an LLVM IR module as input and produce a decompiled version of the code in a high-level programming language such as C or C++.

It's important to note that decompilation of LLVM IR code is not always possible, and the resulting decompiled code may not be identical to the original source code. Additionally, decompilation of optimized or obfuscated code may produce code that is difficult to understand or modify.
