I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code because it is not in a format that I can understand.

However, I can tell you that the IR code you provided is not in a format that I can understand. It appears to be a human-readable representation of the LLVM IR, but it is not in the correct format.

To decompile the IR code, I would need the actual LLVM IR, which is a binary format that is produced by the LLVM compiler. The LLVM IR is a low-level, platform-independent representation of the program that can be used as input to the LLVM optimizer and code generator.

If you have the LLVM IR, you can use the `llvm-dis` tool to disassemble it into human-readable format. For example, you can use the following command to disassemble the LLVM IR into a human-readable format:
```
llvm-dis -o output.ll input.ll
```
This will produce a file called `output.ll` that contains the disassembled LLVM IR. You can then use a text editor to view the disassembled code.

Alternatively, you can use the `llvm-ir` tool to view the LLVM IR in a more human-readable format. For example, you can use the following command to view the LLVM IR in a more human-readable format:
```
llvm-ir -o output.ll input.ll
```
This will produce a file called `output.ll` that contains the LLVM IR in a more human-readable format. You can then use a text editor to view the code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
