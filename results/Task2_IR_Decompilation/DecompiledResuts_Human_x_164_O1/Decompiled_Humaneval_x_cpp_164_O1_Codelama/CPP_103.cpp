I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand.

However, I can tell you that the IR code you provided is likely a low-level representation of the C++ code you provided earlier. It is not intended to be human-readable, and it does not contain any comments or annotations.

If you would like me to decompile the IR code for you, please provide it in a format that I can understand, such as LLVM IR or MSIL.
