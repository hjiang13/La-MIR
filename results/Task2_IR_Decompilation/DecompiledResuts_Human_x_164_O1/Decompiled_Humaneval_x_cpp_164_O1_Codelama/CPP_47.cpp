I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a low-level representation of a program, and it is not a programming language that I can read or understand.

However, I can tell you that the IR code you provided is likely a human-readable representation of the assembly code that a compiler generates from a high-level programming language source code. The IR code is a way to represent the assembly code in a more readable and maintainable format.

If you would like me to decompile the assembly code that the IR code represents, please provide me with the assembly code. I can use my knowledge of assembly language to decompile the code and provide you with the equivalent high-level programming language source code.
