I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a low-level representation of a program, and it is not a programming language that I can read or understand.

However, I can tell you that the IR code is written in a format called LLVM IR, which is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program. It is used by the LLVM compiler infrastructure to represent the code that is being compiled.

If you would like me to decompile the IR code, you will need to provide it in a format that I can understand, such as C or C++ source code. Alternatively, you can use a tool such as the LLVM IR decompiler to decompile the IR code into C or C++ source code.
