    2 | The provided IR code is a low-level representation of a C++ function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains correctly matched brackets. The function uses a loop to iterate over the characters in the string and maintains a "level" variable to keep track of the current nesting depth of the brackets. If the level ever becomes negative or if the level is not zero at the end of the loop, the function returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
