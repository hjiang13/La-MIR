The provided IR code is a function that takes an integer as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, with the first two values (0 and 1) being stored in an array and the rest of the values being calculated by adding the previous two values.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
int fib(int n) {
  int arr[1000];
  arr[0] = 0;
  arr[1] = 1;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + arr[i - 2];
  }
  return arr[n];
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not optimized and may not be the most efficient implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. Additionally, the decompiled code may not be exactly equivalent to the original source code, as the IR code may have been modified or optimized during the compilation process.
