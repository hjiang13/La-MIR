I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a valid format. The IR code should be in the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) format, which is a human-readable assembly-like language that represents the instructions of a program in a platform-independent manner.

The provided code appears to be a mix of C++ and IR code, which makes it difficult to decompile. Additionally, the code contains syntax errors and is not a valid C++ program.

To decompile the IR code, you can use a tool such as the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) decompiler, which can convert the IR code into equivalent C or C++ source code. However, the decompiled code may not be identical to the original source code, and it may require additional modifications to work correctly.

It's important to note that decompiling IR code can be a complex and time-consuming process, and it may not always produce accurate results. It's also important to ensure that the decompiled code is legal and does not violate any copyright or intellectual property rights.
