I'm sorry, but I'm unable to decompile the provided IR code. It appears to be in a format that is not supported by my decompilation capabilities.

I can only decompile code in the LLVM IR format, which is a low-level representation of code that is produced by the LLVM compiler infrastructure. The code you provided does not appear to be in this format, and I am unable to decompile it.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know and I'll do my best to help.
