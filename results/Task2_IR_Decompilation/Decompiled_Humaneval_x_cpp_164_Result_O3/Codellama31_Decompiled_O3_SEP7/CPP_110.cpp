I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a low-level representation of a program, and it is not a programming language that I can read or understand.

However, I can tell you that the IR code is likely to be a representation of a program that has been compiled from a high-level programming language such as C or C++. The IR code is a platform-independent representation of the program, and it is used by the compiler to optimize and generate machine code for the program.

If you have access to the original source code for the program, I can try to help you decompile it. Alternatively, you can try using a decompilation tool such as IDA Pro or OllyDbg to decompile the machine code and generate a high-level representation of the program.
