The provided IR code is a function named `_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE` that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the minimum sum of a subarray. The function uses a divide and conquer approach, where it recursively splits the input vector into smaller subarrays and computes the minimum sum of each subarray. The minimum sum of the two subarrays is then combined to form the final minimum sum.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int minSubArraySum(vector<int> arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    if (n == 1) {
        return arr[0];
    }
    int mid = n / 2;
    int leftSum = minSubArraySum(vector<int>(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + mid));
    int rightSum = minSubArraySum(vector<int>(arr.begin() + mid, arr.end()));
    return min(leftSum, rightSum);
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code, as the IR code has been optimized and transformed by the compiler. However, the decompiled code should have the same behavior and produce the same output as the original C++ code.
