The provided IR code is a function that takes three arguments: a vector, an integer, and another integer. The function appears to be initializing the vector with the given integers, but the exact behavior is difficult to determine without more context.

Here is a possible decompilation of the IR code into C++ code:
```
void initialize_vector(vector<int>* vec, int a, int b) {
    if (a < b) {
        vec->resize(b - a);
        for (int i = a; i < b; i++) {
            vec->at(i) = i;
        }
    } else {
        vec->resize(a - b);
        for (int i = b; i < a; i++) {
            vec->at(i) = i;
        }
    }
}
```
It is important to note that this is just one possible decompilation, and the actual behavior of the function may be different depending on the context in which it is used.
