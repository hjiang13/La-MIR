I am unable to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code appears to be in a binary format, which I am not able to process.

To decompile the IR code, I would need access to the original source code or a human-readable version of the IR code. Alternatively, I could use a tool such as the LLVM IR reader to convert the binary IR code into a human-readable format.

Please provide me with the original source code or a human-readable version of the IR code, and I will be happy to help you with the decompilation.
