```

The provided IR code is a low-level representation of a C++ function that takes an integer argument and returns an integer value. The function is defined in the `CPP_41.cpp` file and has the following signature:
```cpp
int car_race_collision(int x);
```
The function is marked as `dso_local`, which means it is only visible within the current dynamic shared object (DSO) and is not exported to other DSOs.

The function has a single basic block, which starts at label `%2`. The block loads the value of the `x` argument into register `%2` and then multiplies it by itself, storing the result in register `%2`. The function then returns the value in register `%2`.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```cpp
int car_race_collision(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code, but it is functionally equivalent. The decompiler has inferred the original C++ code based on the low-level IR representation.
