The provided IR code is a function called `_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` that takes a vector of floats as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be computing the sum of the squares of the elements in the input vector.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the function:
```
#include <vector>

int sum_squares(std::vector<float> &input) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < input.size(); i++) {
    sum += input[i] * input[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not guaranteed to be perfectly accurate or complete, as the IR code may have been optimized or transformed in various ways before being decompiled.
