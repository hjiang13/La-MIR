The provided IR code is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets in the string are correctly matched. The function is implemented using a loop that iterates over the characters in the string and keeps track of the nesting level of the brackets. If the nesting level becomes negative at any point, the function returns false. If the loop completes and the nesting level is zero, the function returns true.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <string>

bool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {
  int level = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < brackets.length(); i++) {
    if (brackets[i] == '(') {
      level++;
    } else if (brackets[i] == ')') {
      level--;
    }
    if (level < 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return level == 0;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code that was used to generate the IR code. The decompiled code uses a more straightforward implementation of the bracket matching algorithm, while the original C++ code uses a more complex implementation that involves a custom iterator class. However, the decompiled code is functionally equivalent to the original C++ code, and it should produce the same output for the same input.
