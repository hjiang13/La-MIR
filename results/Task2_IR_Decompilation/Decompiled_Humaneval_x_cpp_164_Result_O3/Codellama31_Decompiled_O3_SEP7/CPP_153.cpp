I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a low-level representation of the program, and it would be difficult for me to convert it into equivalent C or C++ source code without access to the original source code. Additionally, the IR code appears to be incomplete, as it is missing the necessary metadata and function definitions to be a complete LLVM IR module.

If you have access to the original source code, I would recommend using a tool such as LLVM's "llvm-dis" to disassemble the IR code into assembly code, and then using a tool such as "objdump" to convert the assembly code into C or C++ source code. Alternatively, you could use a tool such as "llvm-ir" to convert the IR code into a more human-readable format, such as the LLVM textual IR format, which could then be used as input to a decompiler.

It's worth noting that decompilation of IR code is a complex task, and the resulting source code may not be identical to the original source code, and may require additional manual editing to be fully functional.
