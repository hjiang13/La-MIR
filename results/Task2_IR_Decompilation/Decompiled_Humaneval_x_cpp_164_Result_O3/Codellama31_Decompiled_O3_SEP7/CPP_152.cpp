I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. Additionally, decompilation of IR code is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of the underlying architecture and the specific compiler that was used to generate the code.

If you have access to the original source code, I would recommend using a decompiler that is specifically designed for the language and compiler that was used to generate the code. This will give you the best chance of getting accurate and readable source code.

If you do not have access to the original source code, you may want to consider using a disassembler to convert the machine code back into assembly code. This will give you a lower-level representation of the code, but it may still be useful for understanding the overall structure and logic of the program.

In any case, I would recommend consulting with a qualified expert in the field of computer science or software engineering to get the best possible guidance on how to proceed.
