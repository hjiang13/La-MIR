I am unable to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code you provided appears to be in a binary format, which I am not able to process.

To decompile the IR code, I would need access to the original source code that was used to generate the IR. Alternatively, you could provide me with the IR code in a human-readable format, such as text, so that I can attempt to decompile it.

Please note that decompilation of IR code is a complex process that may not always produce accurate results. The resulting decompiled code may not be identical to the original source code, and may require additional modifications to function correctly.
