I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code you provided is not in a format that I can recognize.

However, I can tell you that the IR code you provided is likely in a format that is specific to a particular compiler or toolchain. In order to decompile the code, you would need to use a tool that is specifically designed to work with that particular format.

If you have access to the original source code, I would recommend using a decompiler that is designed to work with the language that the code was written in. This will give you the best results and allow you to understand the code more easily.

If you do not have access to the original source code, you may be able to use a tool that can decompile the code for you. However, the results may not be as accurate or easy to understand as if you had access to the original source code.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
