I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in the correct format. The IR code should be in a format that can be read by the LLVM IR reader.

If you have the IR code in a file, you can use the following command to decompile it:
```
llvm-dis <file>
```
This will produce a human-readable version of the IR code.

Alternatively, you can use the `llvm-ir` tool to decompile the IR code. This tool can be used to convert the IR code to a human-readable format, or to convert it to a different format, such as assembly code.

To use the `llvm-ir` tool, you can run the following command:
```
llvm-ir <file>
```
This will produce a human-readable version of the IR code.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.
