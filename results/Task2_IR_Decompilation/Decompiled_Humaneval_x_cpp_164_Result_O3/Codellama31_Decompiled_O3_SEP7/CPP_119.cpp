I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code provided is not in a format that I can read or process.

To decompile the IR code, I would need a valid LLVM IR file that contains the code for the function that you want to decompile. The file should have a .ll extension and contain the LLVM IR code for the function that you want to decompile.

If you have the IR code in a different format, you may need to use a tool to convert it to the LLVM IR format before I can decompile it.
