I am not able to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code appears to be in a binary format, and I am only able to work with text-based representations of code.

If you could provide me with the IR code in a text-based format, such as a .ll file, I would be happy to try and decompile it for you.
