I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. Additionally, I am not able to decompile code as it is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the code and the compiler that generated it.

However, I can suggest some resources that may be helpful in decompiling the code:

1. The LLVM documentation provides a detailed explanation of the LLVM IR format and the instructions that can be used to generate it.
2. There are several tools available that can help with decompilation, such as LLVM's own disassembler, as well as third-party tools like IDA Pro and OllyDbg.
3. Online resources such as the LLVM IR documentation and the LLVM community forums may also be helpful in understanding the code and finding resources for decompilation.

Please note that decompilation is a complex task that may not always produce accurate results, and it is not always possible to decompile code that has been optimized or obfuscated.
