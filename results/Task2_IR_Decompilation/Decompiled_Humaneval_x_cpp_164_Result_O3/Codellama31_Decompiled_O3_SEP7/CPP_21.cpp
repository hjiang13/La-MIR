I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not a valid input. The provided code is not a valid LLVM IR code, and it does not follow the standard format for LLVM IR.

To decompile an LLVM IR code, you need to use a tool like `llvm-dis` or `llc` which are part of the LLVM toolchain. These tools can take the LLVM IR code as input and generate the corresponding assembly code or machine code.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.
