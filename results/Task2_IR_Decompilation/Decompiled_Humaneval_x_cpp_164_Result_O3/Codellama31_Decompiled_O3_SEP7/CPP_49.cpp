The provided IR code is for a function that takes two integer arguments and returns an integer. The function appears to be a simple implementation of the modulo operation, but with some additional logic to handle negative numbers.

Here is the decompiled C code for the function:
```
int mod(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    int r = a % b;
    if (r < 0) {
        r += b;
    }
    return r;
}
```
The decompiled code is relatively straightforward and should be easy to understand for anyone familiar with the C language. The function takes two integer arguments `a` and `b`, and returns the result of the modulo operation `a % b`. If the result is negative, it is added to `b` to ensure that the result is positive. If `b` is 0, the function returns 0.
