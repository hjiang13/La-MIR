The provided IR code is a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value. The function is defined as follows:

define dso_local zeroext i1 @_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni(i32 %0) local_unnamed_addr #0 {
  %2 = and i32 %0, 1
  %3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0
  %4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7
  %5 = and i1 %4, %3
  ret i1 %5
}

The function takes a single parameter, %0, which is an integer. The function performs the following operations:

1. %2 = and i32 %0, 1: This line performs a bitwise AND operation on the input integer and the constant 1. The result is stored in %2.
2. %3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0: This line compares the result of the previous operation (%2) with the constant 0. If the result is equal to 0, the next line is executed.
3. %4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7: This line compares the input integer (%0) with the constant 7. If the result is greater than 7, the next line is executed.
4. %5 = and i1 %4, %3: This line performs a bitwise AND operation on the results of the previous two operations (%4 and %3). The result is stored in %5.
5. ret i1 %5: This line returns the result of the previous operation (%5) as the output of the function.

The function returns true if the input integer is equal to the sum of its even digits, and false otherwise.

Here is the equivalent C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int x) {
  int y = x & 1;
  if (y == 0) {
    return false;
  }
  if (x > 7) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```
