I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program, and it is not intended to be easily readable or editable by humans.

To decompile the IR code, you would need to use a tool that is specifically designed to convert IR code into a human-readable format, such as a decompiler. However, even with the use of a decompiler, the resulting code may not be easy to understand or edit, as it is often optimized and transformed in ways that are not easily reversible.

If you have any specific questions about the IR code or how it was generated, I would be happy to try to help you understand it better.
