The provided IR code is a function that takes a vector of floats and a float as input, and returns a boolean value. The function checks if the elements in the vector are close to each other, with a maximum difference of the input float.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:
```
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

bool has_close_elements(std::vector<float> vec, float max_diff) {
    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < vec.size(); j++) {
            if (std::abs(vec[i] - vec[j]) <= max_diff) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not the same as the original code, as the original code may have been optimized or modified during the compilation process. However, the decompiled code should have the same behavior and functionality as the original code.
