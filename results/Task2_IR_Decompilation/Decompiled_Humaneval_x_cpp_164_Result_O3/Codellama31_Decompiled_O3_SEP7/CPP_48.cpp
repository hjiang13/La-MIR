I am not able to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code appears to be in a binary format, and I am unable to read or interpret this format.

I am only able to decompile text-based IR code, such as the one provided in the example. If you have access to the original source code that was used to generate the IR code, I may be able to decompile it for you. Alternatively, you may be able to find a tool or software that is able to decompile the IR code for you.
