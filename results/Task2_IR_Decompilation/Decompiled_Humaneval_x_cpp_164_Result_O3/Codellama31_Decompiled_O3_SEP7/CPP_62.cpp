I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code you provided appears to be in a binary format, and I am programmed to understand and work with text-based formats such as assembly code or machine code.

If you have access to the original source code that was used to generate the IR code, I would be happy to help you decompile it. Alternatively, if you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask and I will do my best to assist you.
