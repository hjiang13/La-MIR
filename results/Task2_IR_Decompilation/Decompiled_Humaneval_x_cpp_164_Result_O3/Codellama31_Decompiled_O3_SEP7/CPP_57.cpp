I cannot provide a decompilation of the provided IR code as it is not a valid LLVM IR. The code is missing the necessary module and function definitions, and the instructions are not properly formatted. Additionally, the code contains several undefined references to external symbols, which would make it impossible to decompile into valid C or C++ code.

To decompile the code, you would need to provide a complete and valid LLVM IR module, including the necessary function definitions and external references. You can use tools such as `llvm-dis` to disassemble the IR code into assembly code, and then use a tool such as `llvm-as` to assemble the assembly code back into IR. Alternatively, you can use a tool such as `llvm-ir` to convert the IR code into a human-readable format.

It's important to note that decompilation is a complex process that can be difficult to perform accurately, especially for optimized code. The resulting decompiled code may not be identical to the original source code, and may contain errors or inconsistencies. Therefore, it's important to use decompilation tools with caution and to verify the results manually before using them in any way.
