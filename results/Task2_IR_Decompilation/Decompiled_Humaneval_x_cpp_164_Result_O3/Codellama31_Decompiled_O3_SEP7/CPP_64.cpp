I am unable to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code appears to be in a binary format, and I am programmed to understand and process text-based data.

To decompile the IR code, I would need access to the original source code or a decompiler that can process the binary format. Alternatively, if the IR code is in a text-based format, I may be able to understand and process it if you provide me with the necessary information or context.

Please provide me with more information or context about the IR code, or the original source code if possible, and I will do my best to assist you in decompiling it.
