The provided IR code is for a function that takes two vectors as input and returns a string. The function appears to be a decompilation of a C++ function that checks whether two vectors have a non-empty intersection.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:
```
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

string intersection(vector<int> v1, vector<int> v2) {
    int size1 = v1.size();
    int size2 = v2.size();
    if (size1 == 0 || size2 == 0) {
        return "";
    }
    int minSize = min(size1, size2);
    int maxSize = max(size1, size2);
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    while (i < minSize && j < maxSize) {
        if (v1[i] == v2[j]) {
            return "YES";
        }
        i++;
        j++;
    }
    return "";
}
```
Note that the decompiled code may not be exactly the same as the original C++ code, as the IR code may have been optimized or transformed in some way. However, the decompiled code should be functionally equivalent to the original C++ code.
