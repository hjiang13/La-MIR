The provided IR code is a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value. The function checks if the string has balanced brackets or not.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool correct_bracketing(string brackets) {
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < brackets.length(); i++) {
        if (brackets[i] == '(') {
            level++;
        } else if (brackets[i] == ')') {
            level--;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    if (level != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
The decompiled code is a function that takes a string as input and checks if the string has balanced brackets or not. The function uses a variable `level` to keep track of the number of opening brackets. If the number of opening brackets is greater than the number of closing brackets, the function returns `false`. If the number of opening brackets is equal to the number of closing brackets, the function returns `true`.

It's worth noting that the decompiled code is not the same as the original C++ code that was used to generate the IR code. The decompiled code is a simplified version of the original code, and it may not include all the features and functionality of the original code.
