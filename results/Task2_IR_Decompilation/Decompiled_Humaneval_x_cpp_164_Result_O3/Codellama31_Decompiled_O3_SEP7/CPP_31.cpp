Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool is_prime(int n) {
    if (n < 2) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code may not be exactly the same as the original source code, as the IR code may have been optimized or transformed in various ways during the compilation process. However, the decompiled code should be functionally equivalent to the original code, and can be used as a starting point for reverse engineering or debugging purposes.
