The provided IR code is a function that takes an integer as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be a deobfuscated version of a benchmarking program.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the function:
```
#include <cstdint>

int32_t starts_one_end(int32_t input) {
  if (input < 1) {
    return 0;
  }

  if (input == 1) {
    return 1;
  }

  if (input > 2) {
    return 0;
  }

  int32_t result = 1;
  for (int32_t i = 2; i <= input; i++) {
    result *= 10;
  }

  return result;
}
```
The function takes an integer input and returns an integer. The function appears to be a deobfuscated version of a benchmarking program.

The function starts by checking if the input is less than 1, if it is, it returns 0. If the input is equal to 1, it returns 1. If the input is greater than 2, it returns 0.

If the input is between 2 and 10, the function calculates the result by multiplying 10 by itself input-1 times.

It's worth noting that the function is using the `icmp` instruction to perform comparisons, and the `mul` instruction to perform multiplication. The `phi` instruction is used to select the value of a variable based on the result of a comparison.

It's also worth noting that the function is using the `llvm.loop.mustprogress` attribute, which is used to indicate that the loop must make progress. This attribute is used to prevent infinite loops.
