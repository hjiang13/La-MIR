I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. However, I can provide you with some general tips on how to decompile IR code:

1. Use a tool like llvm-dis to convert the IR code into assembly code. This will make it easier to read and understand the code.
2. Look for the main function in the assembly code. This is usually the entry point of the program and will give you an idea of how the code is structured.
3. Look for function calls and jump instructions. These will give you an idea of how the code flows and how different parts of the program are connected.
4. Look for data structures such as arrays and structures. These will give you an idea of how the program stores and manipulates data.
5. Use a debugger to step through the code and see how it executes. This will give you a better understanding of how the code works and how it interacts with the data.

I hope these tips are helpful in decompiling the IR code. If you have any further questions, please let me know.
