The provided IR code is for a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be a simple algorithm for checking whether a given vector of integers can be rearranged to form a valid arithmetic expression.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int can_arrange(vector<int> &nums) {
  int n = nums.size();
  int i = 0;
  int j = n - 1;
  while (i < j) {
    if (nums[i] + nums[j] == 0) {
      i++;
      j--;
    } else if (nums[i] + nums[j] < 0) {
      i++;
    } else {
      j--;
    }
  }
  return i == j;
}
```
The decompiled code is a simple algorithm that checks whether a given vector of integers can be rearranged to form a valid arithmetic expression. It does this by iterating through the vector and checking whether the sum of the first and last elements is equal to 0. If it is, it increments the first index and decrements the last index. If the sum is less than 0, it only increments the first index. If the sum is greater than 0, it only decrements the last index. The function returns 1 if the vector can be rearranged to form a valid arithmetic expression, and 0 otherwise.

It's worth noting that the decompiled code is not the most efficient implementation of the algorithm, and there may be more efficient ways to implement it. Additionally, the decompiled code does not include any error handling or input validation, so it may not be suitable for use in a production environment without additional modifications.
