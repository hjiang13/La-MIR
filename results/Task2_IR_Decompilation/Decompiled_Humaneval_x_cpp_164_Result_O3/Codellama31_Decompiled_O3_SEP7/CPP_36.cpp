Sure, I can help you with that. The provided IR code is for a function that takes an integer argument and returns an integer value. The function appears to be a simple implementation of the Fizz Buzz algorithm, which is a popular coding challenge that involves printing the numbers from 1 to 100, with the following rules:

* For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
* For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
* For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

Here's the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int fizz_buzz(int n) {
  int result = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
      result += 1;
    } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
      result += 2;
    } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
      result += 3;
    } else {
      result += 4;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```
The decompiled code is not optimized, and it may not be the most efficient implementation of the Fizz Buzz algorithm. However, it should give you a good starting point for understanding the logic of the function and how it works.
