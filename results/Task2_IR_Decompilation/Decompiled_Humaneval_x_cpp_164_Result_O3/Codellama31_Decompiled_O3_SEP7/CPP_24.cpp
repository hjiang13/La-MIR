The provided IR code is for a function that takes an integer argument and returns an integer value. The function appears to be a simple loop that counts the number of divisors of the input integer.

Here is the decompiled C code for the provided IR code:
```
int largest_divisor(int n) {
    int i, count = 0;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not necessarily the original source code, but it should produce the same output as the original program for the same input.
