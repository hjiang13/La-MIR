The IR code you provided is a function called `_Z9is_nestedNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` that takes a single argument of type `std::__cxx11::basic_string<char>*` and returns a value of type `i1`.

Based on the IR code, the function appears to be checking whether a given string is a nested string, meaning that it contains at least one pair of parentheses. The function does this by iterating over the characters in the string and keeping track of the number of parentheses it has seen. If the number of parentheses is ever negative, the function returns false, indicating that the string is not nested. If the function reaches the end of the string and the number of parentheses is still zero, it returns true, indicating that the string is nested.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
#include <string>

bool _Z9is_nestedNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char>* str) {
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < str->length(); i++) {
        if (str[i] == '(') {
            level++;
        } else if (str[i] == ')') {
            level--;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return level == 0;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code, but it should be functionally equivalent. The differences are due to the fact that the IR code was generated by a compiler, which may have optimized the code or rearranged it in various ways.
