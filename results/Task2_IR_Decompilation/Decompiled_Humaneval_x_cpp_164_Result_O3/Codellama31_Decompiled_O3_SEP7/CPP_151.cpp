The provided IR code is a function that takes a vector of floats as input and returns a double value. The function is named "double_the_difference" and it has a single parameter, which is a vector of floats.

The function first checks if the vector is empty by checking if the size of the vector is 0. If the vector is empty, the function returns 0.

Next, the function calculates the difference between the first and last element of the vector. It does this by subtracting the first element from the last element and storing the result in a variable called "diff".

The function then checks if the difference is greater than 0. If the difference is greater than 0, the function returns the difference multiplied by 2. If the difference is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <vector>

double double_the_difference(std::vector<float> &vec) {
    if (vec.size() == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    float diff = vec[0] - vec[vec.size() - 1];

    if (diff > 0) {
        return diff * 2;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original code, but it should produce the same output for the same input.
