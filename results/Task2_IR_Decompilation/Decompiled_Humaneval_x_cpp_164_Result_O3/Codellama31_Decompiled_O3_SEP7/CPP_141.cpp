Sure, I can help you with that. The provided IR code is a function that takes a string as input and checks whether the brackets in the string are correctly balanced. Here's the decompiled C++ code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool file_name_check(string file_name) {
    int len = file_name.length();
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if (file_name[i] == '(') {
            level++;
        } else if (file_name[i] == ')') {
            level--;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    if (level != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
The function takes a string as input and checks whether the brackets in the string are correctly balanced. It does this by iterating through the string and keeping track of the current nesting level. If the nesting level becomes negative at any point, it means that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, and the function returns false. If the nesting level is not zero at the end of the string, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, and the function returns false. If the nesting level is zero and the function has not returned false at any point, it means that the brackets are correctly balanced, and the function returns true.
