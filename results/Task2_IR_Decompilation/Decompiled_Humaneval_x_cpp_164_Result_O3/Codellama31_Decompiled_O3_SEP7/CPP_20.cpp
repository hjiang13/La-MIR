I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program, and it is not a standard input format for decompilation tools.

To decompile the IR code, you would need to use a tool that is specifically designed to work with LLVM IR, such as the LLVM Disassembler. However, even with such a tool, the decompiled code may not be easily readable or understandable, as the IR code is often highly optimized and may not correspond directly to the original source code.

If you have access to the original source code, it would be much easier to understand the program's logic by reading the source code directly. If you do not have access to the original source code, you may be able to reverse engineer the program's logic by analyzing the assembly code or the machine code generated by the compiler. However, this process can be time-consuming and may not always produce accurate results.
