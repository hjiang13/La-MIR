I am not able to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code you provided appears to be in a binary format, which I am not able to read or interpret.

To decompile the IR code, I would need the IR code to be in a human-readable format, such as text or assembly code. Additionally, I would need to know the specific architecture and operating system that the code was compiled for, as well as any other relevant details about the code.

If you have access to the original source code, I would recommend using a decompiler to generate the C or C++ source code from the IR code. If you do not have access to the original source code, you may be able to use a disassembler to generate assembly code from the IR code, and then use a decompiler to generate the C or C++ source code from the assembly code. However, the accuracy of the decompilation may vary depending on the complexity and obfuscation of the code.
