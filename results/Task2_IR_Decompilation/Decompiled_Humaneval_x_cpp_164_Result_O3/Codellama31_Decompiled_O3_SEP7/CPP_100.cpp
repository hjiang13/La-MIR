I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code because it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code provided is not in a format that I can understand.

However, I can tell you that the IR code is likely in a binary format, which is not human-readable. To decompile it, you would need to use a tool that can translate the binary code into assembly code or machine code.

If you have the source code for the program that generated the IR code, you can use a compiler or interpreter to generate the assembly or machine code. Alternatively, you can use a disassembler to translate the binary code into assembly or machine code.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.
