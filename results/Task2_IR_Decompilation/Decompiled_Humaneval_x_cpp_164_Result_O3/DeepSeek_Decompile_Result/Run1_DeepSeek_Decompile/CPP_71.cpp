Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++. The function is called _Z13triangle_areafff, which I think translates to triangle_area with three floats. 

Looking at the IR, it starts by adding the first two arguments, then compares if that sum is greater than the third. It does similar checks by adding the other pairs and comparing. Then it uses those comparisons to decide if the third condition should be checked.

If all conditions are true, it calculates the area using Heron's formula. Heron's formula uses the semi-perimeter, which is (a+b+c)/2. Then the area is the square root of s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c). 

In the IR, after computing s, it calculates s-a, s-b, s-c, multiplies them all together, takes the square root with pow(s, 0.5), and returns that. If the initial conditions fail, it returns -1.0f.

So putting it all together, the function checks if the three sides can form a triangle and then computes the area if they can, otherwise returns -1.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code that can be directly compiled and run, we'll analyze the IR and translate it into its corresponding C++ function. The function appears to calculate the area of a triangle given three sides, returning `-1.0f` if the sides do not form a valid triangle.

### Decompilation Process:

1. **Function Signature**: The IR function `@_Z13triangle_areafff` corresponds to the C++ function `float triangle_area(float, float, float)`.

2. **Triangle Validity Check**: The function first checks if the three sides can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem:
   - `a + b > c`
   - `a + c > b`
   - `b + c > a`

3. **Early Exit for Invalid Triangles**: If any of the conditions fail, the function returns `-1.0f`.

4. **Heron's Formula for Area Calculation**: If the sides form a valid triangle, the function calculates the area using Heron's formula:
   - Compute the semi-perimeter: `s = (a + b + c) / 2`
   - Compute the area: `sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`

### C++ Source Code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

float triangle_area(float a, float b, float c) {
    // Check if the sides satisfy the triangle inequality
    if ((a + b > c) && (a + c > b) && (b + c > a)) {
        // Calculate semi-perimeter
        float s = (a + b + c) * 0.5f;
        // Calculate area using Heron's formula
        return std::sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));
    }
    else {
        // Return -1.0 if the sides do not form a valid triangle
        return -1.0f;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Function Name**: The mangled name `_Z13triangle_areafff` demangles to `triangle_area(float, float, float)`.
- **Triangle Inequality Check**: The IR performs three comparisons to ensure the sides can form a valid triangle.
- **Heron's Formula**: The area is calculated by first finding the semi-perimeter and then using it in the formula `sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))`.
- **Return Value**: Returns the calculated area for valid triangles or `-1.0f` if the sides do not form a valid triangle.

This code can be compiled with a C++ compiler and will compute the area of a triangle given its three sides, adhering to the logic expressed in the provided LLVM IR.
