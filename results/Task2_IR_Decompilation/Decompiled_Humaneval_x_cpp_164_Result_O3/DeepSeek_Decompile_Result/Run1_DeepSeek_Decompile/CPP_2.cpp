Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code that can be run directly. Let me start by understanding what the IR code does.

Looking at the IR, there's a function named `_Z15truncate_numberf` which takes a float as input and returns a float. The function's body has a few steps:

1. `%2 = fptosi float %0 to i32`: This converts the input float `%0` to a signed integer `%2`.
2. `%3 = sitofp i32 %2 to float`: This converts the integer `%2` back to a float `%3`.
3. `%4 = fsub float %0, %3`: This subtracts `%3` from `%0`, storing the result in `%4`.
4. `ret float %4`: Returns `%4` as the result.

So, the function is taking a float, truncating it to an integer, converting it back to float, and then subtracting that from the original value. Essentially, this computes the fractional part of the input float.

Now, I need to translate this into C++. The function is named `_Z15truncate_numberf`, which is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find that this corresponds to `float truncate_number(float)`.

Putting it all together, the C++ function would take a float, cast it to an integer to truncate the decimal part, convert it back to float, and subtract to get the fractional part. So, the source code should be:

```cpp
float truncate_number(float x) {
    float truncated = static_cast<float>(static_cast<int>(x));
    return x - truncated;
}
```

I think this accurately reflects the operations in the IR code. I'll double-check the steps to ensure I didn't miss anything. The IR does the float to int conversion, back to float, subtracts, and returns, which matches the C++ code I wrote. I'm confident this is correct.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we first analyze the function's operations and then translate them into equivalent C++ constructs.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Function Identification:** The IR defines a function `@_Z15truncate_numberf` which, when demangled, translates to `float truncate_number(float)`.

2. **Operation Breakdown:**
   - Convert the input float to an integer, truncating any fractional part.
   - Convert the integer back to a float.
   - Subtract this truncated float value from the original input to get the fractional part.

3. **C++ Translation:** Using `static_cast`, we replicate the truncation and conversion steps in C++.

**Decompiled C++ Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

float truncate_number(float x) {
    float truncated = static_cast<float>(static_cast<int>(x));
    return x - truncated;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    float x = 3.1415926535f;
    float fractional_part = truncate_number(x);
    cout << "Fractional part of " << x << " is " << fractional_part << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the `truncate_number` function and includes a `main` function for demonstration. You can compile and run this to test the functionality.
