<think>
Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing. 

Looking at the function _Z7iscuberi, which I think translates to "iscuberi" with some parameters. The function takes an i32 (a 32-bit integer) and returns a boolean (i1). 

The first part of the function calls llvm.abs.i32 on the input, which is the absolute value function. So, it's calculating the absolute value of the input integer.

Then there's a loop. It initializes a variable %4 to 0 and enters a loop where it calculates %4 squared, multiplies that by %4 again, so that's %4 cubed. It compares this cube to the absolute value from earlier. If the cube is less than the absolute value, it increments %4 by 1 and loops again. Otherwise, it exits the loop.

After the loop, it checks if the cube is less than or equal to the absolute value and returns that as a boolean. Wait, that might not make sense because the loop stops when the cube is not less than the absolute value. So, after the loop, the cube is either equal or greater. So the function returns whether the cube is less than or equal, which would mean it's true only if the cube is exactly equal. But maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, let's go through the code step by step. The function starts with:

%2 = tail call i32 @llvm.abs.i32(i32 %0, i1 true)
br label %3

Then, in the loop:

%4 = phi i32 [0, %1], [%8, %3]
So %4 starts at 0 and increments each iteration.

%5 = mul nsw i32 %4, %4 (square)
%6 = mul nsw i32 %5, %4 (cube)
%7 = icmp ult i32 %6, %2 (if cube < abs)
%8 = add nuw nsw i32 %4, 1
br i1 %7, label %3, label %9

So the loop continues while cube < abs. Once it's not less, it exits the loop.

Then, after the loop, it does:

%10 = icmp ule i32 %6, %2 (if cube <= abs)
ret i1 %10

Wait, but after the loop, %6 is the cube of the last %4, which was incremented and then compared. So if the loop ends because %6 >= %2, then the final comparison is whether %6 is <= %2, which would be true only if they are equal. Otherwise, it's false.

So the function returns true only if the cube of some integer is equal to the absolute value of the input. That is, it's checking if the input is a perfect cube.

Wait, but let's think: for example, if input is 8, cube of 2 is 8, so it returns true. If input is 9, the loop runs for 2 (cube 8 <9), then increments to 3, cube is 27 which is >9, so loop exits. Then it checks if 27 <=9, which is false, so returns false. Wait, but that would mean that the function returns false for 9, which isn't a cube. But wait, the function is called "iscuberi", which I think is supposed to check if a number is a cube. So perhaps the logic is inverted.

Wait, but in the example I just thought, for 8, the loop runs with 2, cube is 8, which is equal to 8, so the loop condition is 8 <8? No, the loop condition is if 8 <8, which is false, so it exits the loop. Then, it checks if 8 <=8, which is true, so returns true. That's correct.

For 9, the loop runs for 2 (8<9, true), increments to 3, cube is 27 which is >9, so loop exits. Then, it checks 27 <=9, which is false, so returns false.

Wait, but what about 1? Let's see. Input 1, absolute is 1. Loop starts with 0: 0^3=0<1, so loop runs. Increments to 1, cube is 1. Now, 1 <1 is false, so loop exits. Then checks 1 <=1, returns true. Correct.

Another example: 6. Absolute is 6. Loop with 0: 0<6, yes. 1:1<6, yes, 2:8<6? No, wait, 2^3 is 8, which is >6. So the loop runs for 1: cube 1<6, yes, increment to 2. Then 8<6? No. So loop exits. Then, check if 8 <=6? No. So returns false.

Wait, but 6 is not a cube, so correct.

Wait, but what about 0? Input 0. Absolute is 0. Loop starts with 0: 0^3=0. 0 <0? No. So loop doesn't run. Then, check 0<=0, returns true.

So the function correctly returns true when the input is a perfect cube, including 0.

So the C++ function would take an integer and return true if it's a perfect cube.

Now, to write the C++ code. The function iscuberi(int x) returns bool.

But wait, the function name in C++ would be something like iscuberi(int x). So let's write that.

The code would compute the absolute value of x, then iterate from 0 upwards, compute cube, and check if cube equals the absolute value.

Wait, but looking at the loop in the IR code, it's a do-while loop because the condition is checked after the body. So in the IR, the loop runs at least once, incrementing %4 each time.

In C++, that would be a do-while loop.

Wait, but in the IR, the loop is structured as:

br label %3
3:
   %4 = phi [0, %1], [%8, %3]
   ... computations ...
   br i1 %7, label %3, label %9

So the loop starts with %4=0, does the body, then checks if to continue.

So in C++, it's a do-while loop: do { ... } while (condition);

So in code:

int x_abs = abs(x);
int i = 0;
do {
    int cube = i * i * i;
    if (cube == x_abs) {
        return true;
    }
    if (cube > x_abs) {
        break;
    }
    i++;
} while (true);

Wait, but in the IR, the loop increments i each time, and checks if cube < abs. So the loop continues as long as cube < abs.

So perhaps in C++:

int x_abs = abs(x);
int i = 0;
while (true) {
    int cube = i * i * i;
    if (cube == x_abs) {
        return true;
    }
    if (cube > x_abs) {
        break;
    }
    i++;
}
return false;

Wait, but the IR code's loop condition is 'ult' which is unsigned less than, but since x is an integer, and we take absolute value, it's non-negative. So using normal comparison is fine.

Alternatively, a more efficient way would be to compute the cube root and see if it's integer. But for the purpose of decompiling, I should match the logic.

So the code would be something like:

bool iscuberi(int x) {
    if (x == 0) return true; // 0 is a cube (0^3=0)
    int x_abs = abs(x);
    int i = 0;
    while (true) {
        int cube = i * i * i;
        if (cube == x_abs) {
            return true;
        }
        if (cube > x_abs) {
            return false;
        }
        i++;
    }
}

Wait, but the loop in the IR increments i each time, so in code, it's better to structure it as:

int i = 0;
while (true) {
    int cube = i * i * i;
    if (cube > x_abs) {
        return false;
    }
    if (cube == x_abs) {
        return true;
    }
    i++;
}

But this could be an infinite loop if x_abs is negative, but since we take absolute value, x_abs is non-negative, so the loop will eventually terminate.

Wait, but in the case of x=0, the loop will compute cube=0, which equals x_abs=0, so returns true.

Another approach could be to compute the integer cube root and check if its cube equals x_abs.

But to stick to the IR code's logic, I'll proceed with the loop.

Wait, but in the IR, the loop initializes i to 0, and in each iteration, it multiplies i by itself three times, which is i^3. So the code should reflect that.

Wait, but in the IR, %6 is computed as %4 * %4 * %4, which is i^3.

So the loop is correct.

Now, putting it all together in C++.
</think>

The decompiled C++ function checks if the input integer is a perfect cube by iterating from zero upwards, computing the cube of each integer, and comparing it to the absolute value of the input. If the cube matches the absolute value, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false once the cube exceeds the absolute value.

```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // for abs

bool iscuberi(int x) {
    int x_abs = std::abs(x);
    int i = 0;
    while (true) {
        int cube = i * i * i;
        if (cube == x_abs) {
            return true;
        }
        if (cube > x_abs) {
            return false;
        }
        ++i;
    }
}
```
