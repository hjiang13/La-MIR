Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I see that the IR code defines a function called `@_Z3addii`. I remember that in C++, when you compile a function, the compiler mangles the name. So I think this might be a mangled name. Let me try to demangle it. The `_Z3addii` part looks like it's using the C++ name mangling scheme. Breaking it down: `_Z` is the prefix, `3` is the length of the function name, so the function is named `add`, and it takes two `i` parameters, which I believe stands for integers. So the function should be `int add(int, int)`.

Looking at the IR code inside the function:

```
%3 = add nsw i32 %1, %0
ret i32 %3
```

This means the function adds `%1` and `%0` (which are the two integer arguments) and returns the result. The `nsw` flag stands for "no signed wrap", meaning it doesn't wrap around on overflow, which is typical for integer addition in C++.

Now, putting this together, the function `add` takes two integers, adds them, and returns the sum. So the C++ code should be straightforward.

I also check the module flags and attributes, but they don't affect the source code much. They're more about optimization and target information. So I can ignore them for the decompilation.

Therefore, the source code should be a simple function that adds two integers and returns the result. I'll write it out and make sure it's compilable.

The given LLVM IR code defines a function `add` that takes two integers and returns their sum. Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

This function can be saved to a .cpp file and compiled with a C++ compiler to produce an executable.
