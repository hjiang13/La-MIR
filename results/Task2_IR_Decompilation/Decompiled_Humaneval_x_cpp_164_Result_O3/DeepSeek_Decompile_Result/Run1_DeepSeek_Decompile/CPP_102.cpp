<think>
Okay, I'm looking at this LLVM IR code, and I need to decompile it back into C or C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what each part does.

The function is called @_Z10choose_numii, which I think is a mangled name. Using a demangler, I find it's "choose_num(int, int)". So the function takes two integers and returns an integer.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by comparing %1 and %0 with icmp slt. That means if %1 is less than %0, it branches to label 12. Otherwise, it goes to label 4.

At label 4, it checks if %1 equals %0 with icmp eq. If they're equal, it proceeds. Then, it computes the remainder of %1 divided by 2 with srem. It checks if this remainder is 1 using icmp eq. It then uses 'and' to see if both the equality of %1 and %0 and the remainder being 1 are true. If so, it goes to label 12; else, it goes to label 9.

In label 9, it signs-extends the result of the remainder check (which is a boolean) to an i32. Then it adds this value to %1 and branches to label 12.

Label 12 is where the function returns. It uses a phi node to determine the return value based on which path was taken. If it came from the initial comparison or the equality check, it returns -1. If it took the path through label 9, it returns the result of the addition.

Putting this together, the function seems to return -1 if %1 is less than %0 or if %1 equals %0 and is even. Otherwise, it returns %1 plus 1 if %1 is odd. 

Wait, no, let me correct that. The addition in label 9 is %10 (which is 0 or 1) added to %1. So if %1 is odd, %10 is 1, so it adds 1 to %1, making it even. But the function returns this value only when %1 is greater than %0 and not equal, and is odd.

But looking back, the function returns -1 in cases where %1 is less than %0 or when %1 equals %0 and is odd. Wait, no, in label 4, the condition is if %1 equals %0 and the remainder is 1 (meaning %1 is odd). So if %1 equals %0 and is odd, it returns -1. Otherwise, if it's even, it goes to label 9, which adds 1 to %1, making it odd, and returns that.

Wait, no. Let me walk through an example. Suppose %0 is 5 and %1 is 6.

First, 6 < 5? No, so go to label 4.

Check if 6 ==5? No, so go to label 9.

In label 9, %6 is 6%2=0, so %7 is 0. %10 is 0 extended to i32. So %11 is 0 +6=6. So return 6.

Another example: %0=5, %1=5.

First, 5<5? No. Go to label4.

Check 5==5? Yes. Then %6=5%2=1. So %7=1. Then %8 is 1 & 1 =1. So branch to label12, return -1.

Another example: %0=5, %1=4.

4<5? Yes. Branch to label12, return -1.

Another example: %0=5, %1=6.

6<5? No. 6==5? No. So go to label9. %6=0, so add 0 to 6, return 6.

Wait, but in the code, when %1 is greater than or equal to %0, and not equal, and %1 is even, it returns %1. But if %1 is greater than %0 and %1 is odd, then it adds 1, making it even. So, the function returns %1 if it's even and greater than %0, or %1+1 if it's odd and greater than %0.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The function returns -1 in two cases: when %1 < %0, or when %1 == %0 and %1 is odd. Otherwise, it returns %1 + (1 if %1 is odd else 0). Wait, no: in label9, it's adding %10, which is the sign-extended %7. %7 is whether %1 is odd. So if %1 is odd, %10 is 1, so %11 is %1 +1. If %1 is even, %10 is 0, so %11 is %1 +0.

Wait, but in label9, we only get there if the condition in label4 fails. The condition in label4 is (if %1 == %0 and %1 is odd). So, if %1 == %0 and is odd, we return -1. If %1 == %0 and is even, that condition is false, so we go to label9, which adds 0, so return %1.

Wait, but in label4, the condition is if %1 == %0 and %1 is odd, then return -1. Otherwise, if %1 == %0 but even, we go to label9, which adds 0, returning %1.

So, to summarize, the function returns:

- If %1 < %0: return -1
- Else if %1 == %0 and %1 is odd: return -1
- Else if %1 > %0:
   - If %1 is even: return %1
   - If %1 is odd: return %1 +1

Wait, but in label9, we're adding %10, which is 1 if %1 is odd, 0 otherwise. So when %1 is even, we return %1, when odd, return %1 +1.

But wait, the condition in label4 is checking if %1 == %0 and %1 is odd. So, when %1 > %0, regardless of whether it's odd or even, we go to label9, which will add 0 or 1.

So, the function can be rewritten as:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) return -1;
    if (b == a && (b % 2 == 1)) return -1;
    if (b > a) {
        if (b % 2 == 0) return b;
        else return b + 1;
    }
}

But that's a bit redundant. Let me see if I can simplify it.

Alternatively, the function returns -1 if b < a or (b == a and b is odd). Otherwise, if b > a, it returns b if even, else b+1.

So, the function can be written more concisely as:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a || (b == a && b % 2 != 0)) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        return (b % 2 == 0) ? b : b + 1;
    }
}

Wait, but in the IR, the else part is when b >= a and not (b ==a and b is odd). So, when b > a, regardless of whether it's odd or even, it returns b + (b is odd). So, in code, that's b + (b % 2).

Wait, but looking at the IR, in label9, it's adding %10, which is the sign-extended %7, which is whether b is odd. So %11 = b + %10, which is 0 if even, 1 if odd.

So, in code, it's b + (b % 2 ? 1 : 0). So, for even b, add 0; for odd b, add 1.

So, the function returns b if even when b > a, else b+1.

So, putting it all together, the function is:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) return -1;
    if (b == a && (b % 2 == 1)) return -1;
    return (b % 2 == 0) ? b : b + 1;
}

Alternatively, since if b ==a and even, it returns b, else if b >a, returns b if even, else b+1.

Wait, but in the case where b ==a and even, it's included in the else clause, which returns b.

So the function can be written as:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a || (b == a && b % 2)) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        return b + (b % 2);
    }
}

Because when b >a, it's in the else, and adds b %2, which is 0 if even, 1 if odd.

So that's the decompiled code.
</think>

To decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Function Name**: The function in the IR is `@_Z10choose_numii`, which when demangled translates to `choose_num(int, int)`.

2. **Understand the Function Logic**:
    - The function takes two integers, `a` and `b`.
    - It returns `-1` if `b < a` or if `b` equals `a` and is odd.
    - If `b > a`, it returns `b` if `b` is even, otherwise `b + 1`.

3. **Translate the Logic into C++ Code**:
    - Check if `b` is less than `a` and return `-1`.
    - If `b` equals `a`, check if `b` is odd and return `-1` if true.
    - For `b` greater than `a`, return `b` adjusted to the next even number if `b` is odd.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a || (b == a && b % 2 != 0)) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        return b + (b % 2);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    cout << choose_num(5, 4) << endl;  // Output: -1
    cout << choose_num(5, 5) << endl;  // Output: -1
    cout << choose_num(5, 6) << endl;  // Output: 6
    cout << choose_num(5, 7) << endl;  // Output: 8
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the function `choose_num` with the same logic as the provided IR and includes a `main` function for example usage.
