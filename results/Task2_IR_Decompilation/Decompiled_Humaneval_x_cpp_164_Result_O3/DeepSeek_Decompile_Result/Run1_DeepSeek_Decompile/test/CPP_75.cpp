<think>
Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code, and I need to decompile it back into C or C++ source code. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my LLVM IR, but I'll give it a shot. Let me start by looking at the code provided.

The function is called @_Z17is_multiply_primei, which I think is a mangled C++ name. If I demangle that, it should give me a human-readable name. Let me try: "is_multiply_primei" – okay, so it's a function that probably checks if a number is a multiply prime or something like that.

Looking at the function signature, it's a boolean function (returns i1) that takes an i32 parameter. So the function returns a bool and takes an integer.

Now, let me go through the code step by step.

The function starts with an icmp instruction checking if %0 (the input) is less than 4. If true, it branches to label 11; otherwise, it goes to label 3.

Label 11 seems to handle the case where the input is less than 4. It uses a phi node to get %12, which is 0 or %25 from label 23. Then it checks if %12 is equal to 2. If yes, it returns true; otherwise, I guess it returns false, but I don't see a direct ret here. Hmm, maybe the other paths handle that.

Moving to label 3, there are phi nodes for %4, %5, %6. It looks like some loop variables. Then it calculates %7 as the remainder of %6 divided by %4. Then it checks if %7 is 0 and if %6 is greater than %4. If both are true, it branches to label 14; else, it goes to 23.

Label 14 seems to be another loop. It has phi nodes for %15 and %16. Then it divides %16 by %4, increments %15, and checks if the remainder is 0 and if the quotient is greater than %4. If so, it loops back; otherwise, it goes to label 23.

Label 23 updates some variables using phi nodes again, increments %4, calculates %26 as %4+1, then %27 as %26 squared. It checks if %27 is greater than %24. If yes, it goes to label 11; else, back to label 3.

Putting this all together, it seems like the function is checking if a number is a "multiply prime." From what I remember, a multiply prime is a number where all its prime factors are unique, or perhaps it's a number that can be expressed as the product of primes in a certain way.

Wait, maybe the function is checking if the number is square-free. A square-free number is one which is not divisible by any square number greater than 1. That would mean that in its prime factorization, no prime is squared or higher. So, for example, 10 is square-free (2*5), but 12 is not (2^2*3).

Looking at the code, the function seems to iterate through possible divisors, checking if any divisor squared divides the number. If it finds such a divisor, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true. That would align with checking for square-free numbers.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. If n < 4, handle specially. For n=0,1,2,3, check if it's 2, which is a prime. Wait, but the function may return whether it's a multiply prime, which might not include 1. Hmm, maybe the initial check returns true only for 2.

2. For n >=4, start checking from 2 upwards. For each possible divisor d starting at 2, check if d squared divides n. If d squared divides n, return false because it's not square-free. If d exceeds sqrt(n), then return true.

Wait, but the code in label 3 starts with %4 as 2, and %5 as 0, %6 as %0 (n). Then it checks if n mod d is 0 and if n > d. If so, it goes to label 14, which seems to check if n/d is divisible by d again. If yes, it loops; else, it continues.

Alternatively, perhaps it's checking if any divisor d of n has d squared dividing n.

So, putting it all together, the function returns true if n is square-free, false otherwise.

So, translating this into C++, the function is_multiply_primei(int n) returns whether n is square-free.

Let me write the C++ code accordingly.

First, handle the case where n < 2: return false.

Wait, no. Square-free numbers can be 1, 2, 3, etc. Wait, 1 is considered square-free because it has no prime factors. So, the function should return true for n=1, true for primes, and false for numbers divisible by a square of a prime.

Wait, looking back at the initial code, for n <4, it returns whether the number is 2. Because in label 11, it checks if %12 is 2. So, for n=0,1,2,3, it returns true only if n is 2. That suggests that the function is checking for primes, but that doesn't fit with the square-free idea.

Wait, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it's checking if the number is a prime, but the function name suggests "multiply_prime," which is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps it's checking if the number is square-free, but for n <4, only 2 is considered, which is a square-free prime.

Wait, let me think again.

The initial check is if n <4. If so, branch to label 11. In label 11, it's using a phi node for %12, which is 0 or %25 from label 23. Then it checks if %12 is 2, and returns true if so.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Maybe the function is actually checking if n is a prime number. Because for n <4, it returns true only for 2, which is prime. Then, for n >=4, it checks for factors.

Wait, let me test this logic with n=4. The code would go to label 3. %4 is 2, %5 is 0, %6 is 4. Then %7 is 4 mod 2=0. %9 is 4>2, so %10 is true, so it goes to label14.

In label14, %15 is 0, %16 is4. Then %17 is 4/2=2. %18 is 1. %19 is 2 mod 2=0. %21 is 2>2? No, so %22 is false, so it goes to label23.

In label23, %24 is4, %25 is1, %26 is3, %27 is9. Is 9>4? Yes, so it goes to label11.

In label11, %12 is0, so check if 0==2? No, return false.

So for n=4, the function returns false, which would make sense if it's checking for primes, but 4 is not prime. Alternatively, if it's checking for square-free, 4 is not square-free, so it returns false.

Wait, so n=4 would return false whether it's checking for primes or square-free. Let's try n=6.

n=6: label3, %4=2, %5=0, %6=6. 6 mod 2=0, and 6>2, so go to label14.

In label14, %15=0, %16=6. %17=3, %18=1. %19=3 mod2=1≠0, so %22=false, go to label23.

In label23, %24=6, %25=1, %26=3, %27=9. 9>6? Yes, go to label11.

In label11, %12=1. 1≠2, so return false. But 6 is square-free (factors 2 and 3), so the function should return true. Hmm, this contradicts. So perhaps the function isn't checking for square-free.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try again.

Wait, in label14 for n=6, after %17=3, %19=3 mod2=1≠0, so %22 is false, so it goes to label23.

In label23, %24 becomes 6, %25 becomes1, %26=3, %27=9. 9>6, so go to label11.

In label11, %12 is 1, which is not equal to 2, so ret 0 (false). But 6 is square-free, so the function returns false, which would be incorrect if it's supposed to check square-free.

Wait, that suggests that the function is not correctly checking square-free. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is checking for square factors greater than 1. Let's see: for n=6, it's 2*3. No square factors, so it should return true. But according to the code, it returns false. So perhaps the function is not checking for square-free.

Alternatively, maybe the function is checking if n is a prime. For n=6, it's not prime, so returns false. For n=5, let's see.

n=5: label3, %4=2, %5=0, %6=5. 5 mod2=1≠0, so go to label23.

In label23, %24=5, %25=0, %26=3, %27=9. 9>5? Yes, go to label11.

In label11, %12=0, which is not 2, so return false. But 5 is prime, so should return true. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code. Maybe the initial return is for when n is 2, but for primes larger than 2, it's not returning true.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the code. Let me look again.

After label23, when it goes back to label3, %4 is incremented. So for n=5, after the first loop, %4 becomes 3.

Next iteration in label3: %4=3, %5=0, %6=5. 5 mod3=2≠0, so go to label23.

In label23, %24=5, %25=0, %26=4, %27=16. 16>5, so go to label11.

In label11, %12=0, so return false. But 5 is prime, so that's incorrect.

Hmm, this suggests that the function is not correctly identifying primes. Alternatively, perhaps the function is doing something else.

Wait, maybe the function is checking if n is a square of a prime. For n=4 (2^2), it returns false, but for n=9 (3^2), let's see.

n=9: label3, %4=2, %5=0, %6=9. 9 mod2=1≠0, so go to label23.

%24=9, %25=0, %26=3, %27=9>9? No, 9 is not greater than9, so go back to label3.

In label3, %4=3, %5=0, %6=9. 9 mod3=0, and 9>3, so go to label14.

In label14, %15=0, %16=9. %17=3, %18=1. %19=3 mod3=0, and 3>3? No. So %22=false, go to label23.

In label23, %24=9, %25=1, %26=4, %27=16>9, so go to label11.

In label11, %12=1≠2, return false. But 9 is 3 squared, so if the function is checking for square factors, it should return false, which it does. But for 6, it also returns false, which is wrong.

Wait, maybe the function is checking if the number is a prime power, i.e., n = p^k for some prime p and integer k>1. So, it returns true only if n is a prime power.

But for n=4=2^2, it returns false, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's checking if the number is a product of distinct primes, i.e., square-free and not prime.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of what the code is doing step by step.

The function starts by checking if n <4. If so, returns true only if n is 2.

Else, it enters a loop where it tries to find a divisor d starting from 2. For each d, it checks if d divides n. If it does, then it checks if n/d is also divisible by d, which would mean d^2 divides n. If so, it continues the loop, else it proceeds.

Wait, no. Let me look at label3: it computes %7 = n mod d. If %7 is 0 and n >d, then it goes to label14.

In label14, it computes quotient = n/d, then checks if quotient mod d is 0 and quotient >d. If so, it loops back to label14, else goes to label23.

So, it's checking for consecutive divisions by d. If after dividing by d once, the quotient can be divided by d again, it continues; else, it moves on.

Wait, perhaps it's factoring n into primes, and checking if any prime occurs more than once. So, if n is divisible by d, and then the quotient is also divisible by d, then d^2 divides n, so it's not square-free.

But in the code, when it finds that d divides n, it then checks if d divides the quotient. If so, it loops to check further. If not, it continues.

But in the code, it seems that if any d divides n and then the quotient is also divisible by d, it returns false. So, the function returns false if n has any square factor.

Thus, the function should return true only if n is square-free.

But earlier, for n=6, the function returns false, which would be correct because 6 is square-free (factors 2 and 3, no squares). Wait, no, 6 is square-free, so the function should return true. But according to the code, for n=6, it returns false. That's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the simulation. Let me try n=6 again.

n=6: label3, %4=2, %5=0, %6=6.

%7=6 mod2=0, %9=6>2, so %10=true, go to label14.

In label14: %15=0, %16=6.

%17=6/2=3, %18=1.

%19=3 mod2=1≠0, so %22=false, go to label23.

In label23: %24=6, %25=1, %26=3, %27=9>6, so go to label11.

In label11: %12=1, which is not 2, so return false.

But 6 is square-free, so the function should return true. This suggests that the code is not correctly handling square-free numbers, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is checking if n is a prime, but for n=2, it returns true, for n=3, let's see.

n=3: label3, %4=2, %5=0, %6=3.

%7=3 mod2=1≠0, so go to label23.

In label23: %24=3, %25=0, %26=3, %27=9>3, so go to label11.

In label11: %12=0≠2, so return false. But 3 is prime, which should return true. So the function is not correctly identifying primes either.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me try to write the code based on the IR.

The function seems to have a loop that starts with d=2, and for each d, it checks if d divides n. If it does, it then checks if the quotient is also divisible by d. If so, it continues; else, it proceeds.

Wait, perhaps the function is checking if n is divisible by any square number. So, for each d starting from 2, it checks if d^2 divides n. If yes, returns false. If no, continues until d exceeds sqrt(n), then returns true.

So, the function should return true if n is square-free.

But according to the simulation for n=6, it returns false. That must mean I made a mistake in the simulation.

Wait, in label14 for n=6, after %17=3, %19=3 mod2=1≠0, so %22=false, so it goes to label23.

In label23, %24=6, %25=1, %26=3, %27=9>6, so go to label11.

In label11, %12=1, which is not 2, so return false.

But 6 is square-free, so this is incorrect. So perhaps the function is not correctly checking square-free.

Alternatively, maybe the function is checking for primes, but the logic is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return true if n is a product of distinct primes, but the code is not handling it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return whether n is a power of a prime, but that doesn't fit the initial condition.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to write the C++ code that matches the IR, regardless of what it's supposed to do, and then see.

Looking at the code, the function starts with:

if (n <4) {
    return (n == 2);
}

else, it enters a loop with d starting at 2.

Wait, no. Because the IR uses phi nodes, which suggests that the variables are being updated in a loop.

So, perhaps the code is:

bool is_multiply_prime(int n) {
    if (n < 2) return false;
    for (int d = 2; d*d <=n; ++d) {
        if (n %d ==0) {
            int quotient = n/d;
            if (quotient %d ==0) {
                return false;
            }
            while (quotient %d ==0) {
                quotient /=d;
            }
            n = quotient;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, no, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps
#undef NDEBUG
#include<assert.h>
int main(){
    assert (is_multiply_prime(5) == false);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(30) == true);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(8) == true);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(10) == false);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(125) == true);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(3 * 5 * 7) == true);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(3 * 6 * 7) == false);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(9 * 9 * 9) == false);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(11 * 9 * 9) == false);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(11 * 13 * 7) == true);
}
