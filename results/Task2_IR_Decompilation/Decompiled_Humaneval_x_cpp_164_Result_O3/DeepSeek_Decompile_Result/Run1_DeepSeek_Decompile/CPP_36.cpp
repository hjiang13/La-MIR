<think>
Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code that I need to decompile back into C or C++ source code. I'm not super familiar with LLVM IR, but I know it's an intermediate representation used by compilers like Clang. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the function definition. The function is named @_Z9fizz_buzzi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, that should translate to "fizz_buzz". So the function is called fizz_buzz and takes an i32 (which is an integer) as an argument and returns an i32.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by comparing the input %0 (which is the argument) with 0 using icmp sgt (signed greater than). If it's greater than 0, it branches to label 5; otherwise, it goes to label 3.

Label 3 is a phi node, which suggests it's the start of a loop or some control flow. The phi node for %4 takes 0 from %1 (the entry block) or %25 from %24. Then it returns %4. So if the input is 0 or negative, it returns 0.

If the input is positive, we go to label 5. Here, there are phi nodes for %6 and %7. %6 is either 0 or %26, and %7 is either 0 or %25. Then, %8 is %6 modulo 11, and %9 checks if that's not zero. Similarly, %10 is %6 modulo 13, and %11 checks if that's not zero. %12 is the AND of %9 and %11, so it's true only if both are true.

Then, %13 checks if %6 is 0. %14 is a select between true (if %12 is true) and %13. So if both mod operations are non-zero, it's true; otherwise, it uses whether %6 is zero. Then it branches to label 24 if %14 is true, else to label 15.

Label 15 has phi nodes for %16 and %17. %16 is either %22 or %6, and %17 is either %21 or %7. Then %18 is %16 mod 10, and %19 checks if it's equal to 7. That's converted to an integer %20, which is 0 or 1. %21 adds that to %17. %22 is %16 divided by 10. %23 checks if %16 is less than 10. If so, it goes to 24; else, loops back to 15.

Label 24 has phi nodes for %25 and %26. %25 is %7 or %21, and %26 is %6 +1. Then %27 checks if %26 equals %0 (the input). If so, it goes to label 3, else back to 5.

Putting this together, the function seems to be calculating something based on the input. Let me think about what it's doing.

When the input is positive, it enters a loop where it checks if the current number is divisible by both 11 and 13. If it's not, it proceeds to check if the last digit is 7. If so, it adds 1 to a counter. It does this until the number reaches the input value.

So, the function counts how many numbers from 1 to n have their last digit as 7 and are not multiples of 11 or 13.

Wait, no, looking again: the select instruction in label 5 decides whether to loop again. If the number is not a multiple of 11 and 13, and it's not zero, it goes to label 24. Otherwise, it goes to 15. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's the classic FizzBuzz problem, but modified. In FizzBuzz, you print "Fizz" if divisible by 3, "Buzz" if by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if by both. Otherwise, print the number. But this code seems to be counting something instead.

Wait, the function returns an integer. So perhaps it's counting how many numbers up to n meet certain conditions. Let me see.

Looking at the code, in label 15, it's checking if the last digit is 7. If so, it adds 1 to a sum. It does this by taking the remainder when divided by 10 and checking for equality with 7. So every time a number ends with 7, it increments a counter.

But wait, in the code, the loop in label 15 runs as long as %16 is greater than or equal to 10. So it's processing each digit? Or perhaps it's processing the number digit by digit.

Wait, perhaps the function is summing the digits of the number. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is checking for numbers that end with 7 and are not multiples of 11 or 13. But that might not fit the code.

Wait, no, the code in label 5 checks if the current number (starting from 1) is not a multiple of 11 or 13. If it is, it skips; if not, it proceeds to check if the last digit is 7. So it's counting how many numbers from 1 to n are not multiples of 11 or 13 and end with 7.

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's counting numbers that end with 7, and are not multiples of 11 or 13. But the code seems to be adding 1 for each such occurrence.

But looking at the code, in label 15, it's taking the current number, mod 10, and if it's 7, it adds 1 to %17, which is the sum. So it's summing 1 for each digit that is 7 in the current number? Or for each number that ends with 7?

Wait, no. Let's see:

In label 15, %16 is the current number (starting from 1 and incrementing each loop). It checks %16 mod 10 ==7, and if so, adds 1 to %17. Then it divides %16 by 10 and loops until %16 is less than 10.

Wait, no, the loop in 15 is controlled by %23, which is whether %16 is less than 10. So if %16 is 123, it will loop, taking 123, then 12, then 1, each time checking if the last digit is 7.

So, the function is counting the number of 7's in the digits of each number from 1 to n, but only for numbers that are not multiples of 11 or 13.

Wait, no, because the condition in label 5 is checking whether the current number is a multiple of both 11 and 13. If it's a multiple of both, then %12 is false, so %14 is whether %6 is zero. But %6 is the current number, so it's not zero. So it would go to label 15. So perhaps the condition is that if the number is not a multiple of 11 and 13, then it proceeds to count the 7's in its digits.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is counting the number of times 7 appears as a digit in numbers that are multiples of 11 or 13. But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to map this out with an example. Suppose the input is 27.

The function starts with %0 =27.

Since 27>0, it goes to label 5.

%6 is 0 (since it's the first iteration), but wait, no: %6 is from the phi node in label 5, which is 0 on the first pass. Wait, no, the phi nodes in label 5 take %26 from %24 or 0 from %1. But on the first iteration, we come from %1, so %6 is 0 and %7 is 0.

Then, %8 is 0 mod 11 =0, so %9 is false. %10 is 0 mod13=0, so %11 is false. %12 is false. %13 is 0 ==0, true. So %14 is true, so it goes to label 24.

In label 24, %25 is 0 (from %7) and %26 is 0+1=1. Then %27 is 1 ==27? No, so it loops back to label 5.

Now, in label 5 again, %6 is 1 (from %26) and %7 is 0. Then %8=1 mod11=1≠0, %9=true. %10=1 mod13=1≠0, %11=true. So %12=true. %13=1==0? No. So %14 is true, so it goes to 24.

Wait, no, %14 is select %12, true, %13. So since %12 is true, it selects true, so it branches to 24.

So in 24, %25 is 0 (from %7=0), and %26=1+1=2. Then check if 2==27? No, loop back.

This seems like it's incrementing %26 each time, so it's looping from 1 upwards.

Wait, but then in label 5, when %6 is 1, it's checking if it's a multiple of 11 and 13. It's not, so it goes to 24, which increments to 2. Then again, same process.

This seems like it's just counting up from 1 to n, and for each number, it's checking whether it's a multiple of both 11 and 13. If it is, it skips; otherwise, it proceeds.

But then what does it do in label 15? Let's say we reach a number where it's not a multiple of both, so it goes to label 15.

In label 15, %16 is the current number (e.g., 7), and %17 is 0. Then it checks 7 mod10=7, so %20=1. %21=0+1=1. Then %22=7/10=0. Since 0<10, it goes to 24.

In 24, %25=1 (from %21), and %26=7+1=8. Then check if 8==27? No, so back to 5.

So, it seems that each time the number is not a multiple of 11 and 13, it counts the number of 7's in its digits and adds that to the total sum.

So, the function is summing the count of digit '7's in all numbers from 1 to n, but only for numbers that are not multiples of both 11 and 13.

Wait, but in the code, the condition is that if the number is not a multiple of both 11 and 13, then it proceeds to count the 7's. So it's including numbers that are multiples of either but not both. Hmm, no: %12 is (not multiple of 11) AND (not multiple of 13). So if a number is a multiple of 11 but not 13, %12 is false, so it doesn't proceed. Wait, no: %9 is (mod11 !=0), %11 is (mod13 !=0). So %12 is true only if both are not zero, meaning the number is not a multiple of 11 and not a multiple of 13. So, if a number is a multiple of 11 or 13, but not both, then %12 is false, so it doesn't proceed to count the 7's.

Wait, no: %12 is the AND of %9 and %11. So %12 is true only if both are true, i.e., the number is not a multiple of 11 AND not a multiple of 13. So, if a number is a multiple of 11 but not 13, %9 is false, so %12 is false. Similarly, if it's a multiple of 13 but not 11, %11 is false, so %12 is false. Only numbers that are not multiples of either will have %12 true.

So, the function is summing the count of 7's in the digits of each number from 1 to n, but only for those numbers that are not multiples of 11 or 13.

Wait, no, because the condition is if %12 is true, meaning the number is not a multiple of either, then it goes to label 24, else it goes to 15. Wait, no: the select in label 5 is if %12 is true, select true, else %13 (which is whether %6 is 0). So if %12 is true, it goes to 24; else, it goes to 15 if %6 is not 0.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me try to write pseudocode based on the IR.

Function fizz_buzz(int n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    sum = 0
    current = 1
    while current <= n:
        if current is not a multiple of 11 and not a multiple of 13:
            count += count_of_7_digits(current)
        current +=1
    return count

Wait, but in the code, for each current, it's checking if it's not a multiple of 11 and 13. If so, it goes to 24, else to 15. Wait, no, in the code, it's:

if (current is not a multiple of 11 AND not a multiple of 13):
    go to 24
else:
    go to 15

But in label 24, it just increments current and loops back. In label 15, it's processing the digits of current, checking for 7s.

Wait, perhaps I have it backwards. Let me see:

In label 5, after computing %12 and %13, it selects to go to 24 if %12 is true, else to 15.

So if %12 is true (current is not a multiple of 11 and not a multiple of 13), it goes to 24, which increments current and loops. Otherwise, it goes to 15, which counts the 7's in current.

Wait, that would mean that it's only counting 7's for numbers that are multiples of 11 or 13. That doesn't make much sense. But in the code, when it's not a multiple of both, it skips to 24, which just increments and continues, not adding anything. When it is a multiple of either, it goes to 15, which counts the 7's.

So perhaps the function is summing the number of 7's in numbers that are multiples of 11 or 13 up to n.

Wait, let's think: when current is a multiple of 11 or 13, it's allowed to count the 7's. So for each such number, it counts how many 7's are in its digits and adds that to the sum.

So, the function returns the total count of digit '7's in all numbers from 1 to n that are multiples of 11 or 13.

Wait, but the condition is that if the number is not a multiple of both, it skips. So, if it's a multiple of either, it proceeds to count.

Wait, no: the condition is %12 = (not multiple of 11) AND (not multiple of 13). So if the number is a multiple of 11 or 13, %12 is false, so it goes to 15, which counts the 7's.

So, the function is summing the count of 7's in the digits of each number that is a multiple of 11 or 13 up to n.

Yes, that makes sense. So for each number from 1 to n, if it's a multiple of 11 or 13, count the number of 7's in its digits and add to sum.

So, the C++ code would look something like this:

int fizz_buzz(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) return 0;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int current = 1; current <= n; ++current) {
        if (current % 11 == 0 || current % 13 == 0) {
            int num = current;
            while (num > 0) {
                if (num % 10 == 7) {
                    sum++;
                }
                num /= 10;
            }
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

Wait, but wait: in the IR, the condition is (not multiple of 11) AND (not multiple of 13). So in code, it's:

if (current %11 !=0 && current%13 !=0) {
    // do nothing, just increment
} else {
    // count 7's
}

So the code should be:

int fizz_buzz(int n) {
    if (n <=0) return 0;
    int sum =0;
    for(int current=1; current <=n; current++){
        bool mod11 = (current %11 ==0);
        bool mod13 = (current %13 ==0);
        if(mod11 || mod13){
            int num = current;
            while(num !=0){
                if(num%10 ==7){
                    sum++;
                }
                num /=10;
            }
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

Wait, but in the IR, the condition is checking if it's NOT a multiple of both. So if it's a multiple of either, it's included. So yes, the code above is correct.

So the function is summing all the '7's in the digits of numbers from 1 to n that are multiples of 11 or 13.

Wait, but in the IR, the condition is if (not mod11) && (not mod13), then do nothing. Else, count the 7's. So yes, that's correct.

I think that's the correct interpretation. So the C++ code should reflect that.
</think>

The provided LLVM IR code implements a function `fizz_buzz` that calculates the total number of '7's in the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n` that are multiples of 11 or 13. Here's the C++ source code that corresponds to the given IR:

```cpp
int fizz_buzz(int n) {
    if (n <= 0)
        return 0;
    int sum = 0;
    for (int current = 1; current <= n; ++current) {
        bool mod11 = (current % 11 == 0);
        bool mod13 = (current % 13 == 0);
        if (mod11 || mod13) {
            int num = current;
            do {
                if (num % 10 == 7) {
                    sum++;
                }
                num /= 10;
            } while (num != 0);
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```
