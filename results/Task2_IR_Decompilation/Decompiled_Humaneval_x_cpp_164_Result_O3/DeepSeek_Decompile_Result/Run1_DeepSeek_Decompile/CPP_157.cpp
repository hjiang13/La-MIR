Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to decompile some LLVM IR code into C or C++ source code. The user provided the IR for a function called _Z20right_angle_trianglefff, which I think is a C++ function because of the naming convention. So, my goal is to understand what this function does and then write the corresponding C++ code.

First, I'll start by examining the IR code step by step. The function takes three float arguments, %0, %1, and %2, which I'll assume are a, b, and c respectively. The function returns an i1, which is a boolean.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by squaring each of the first two arguments: %4 is a squared, and %5 is b squared. Then it adds those squares to get %6. Next, it squares c to get %7. It subtracts %7 from %6 and takes the absolute value of that result, checking if it's less than 1e-4. If it is, the function returns true, indicating that a² + b² is close to c², which would mean it's a right-angled triangle with c as the hypotenuse.

If that first check isn't true, the function moves on to the next part. Here, it adds a² and c², subtracts b², takes the absolute value, and checks if it's less than 1e-4. If so, it returns true, meaning now b is the hypotenuse.

If that's not the case either, it checks the third possibility: adding b² and c², subtracting a², and again checking against the threshold. If any of these checks pass, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

So, putting this together, the function is checking all three possible combinations to see if any of the sides could be the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle, considering some floating-point tolerance.

I need to translate this logic into C++. The function will take three floats and return a boolean. I'll need to compute the squares, perform the checks using fabs for absolute value, and compare against the epsilon value of 1e-4.

I should be careful with the order of operations to ensure that each condition is checked correctly. Also, since epsilon is a small value, using fabs will help avoid issues with negative results from subtraction.

Putting it all together, the function will have three if conditions, each checking one of the possible right angle scenarios. If any condition is met, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false after all checks.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write out the C++ code that matches this logic.

Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I'll decompile it back to C++ source code. Here's the decompiled code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

bool right_angle_triangle(float a, float b, float c) {
    // Check if a² + b² ≈ c²
    if (std::fabs(a*a + b*b - c*c) < 1e-4) {
        return true;
    }
    // Check if a² + c² ≈ b²
    if (std::fabs(a*a + c*c - b*b) < 1e-4) {
        return true;
    }
    // Check if b² + c² ≈ a²
    if (std::fabs(b*b + c*c - a*a) < 1e-4) {
        return true;
    }
    // If none of the above conditions are met
    return false;
}
```

This function checks if the three given floating-point numbers can form a right-angled triangle by verifying the Pythagorean theorem for all possible combinations of sides, allowing for a small floating-point tolerance (1e-4).
