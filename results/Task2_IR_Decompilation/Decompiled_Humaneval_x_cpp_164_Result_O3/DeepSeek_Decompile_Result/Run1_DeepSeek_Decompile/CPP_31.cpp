Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code that I need to decompile back into C++ source code. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

Looking at the function definition, it's a function called _Z8is_primex which takes an i64 parameter. The function returns an i1, which is a boolean. So this function is probably checking if a number is prime. The name "is_prime" makes sense.

Starting with the function, the first thing it does is compare the input (let's call it x) with 2. If x is less than 2, it branches to label 15, which seems to return false. That makes sense because numbers less than 2 aren't prime.

Next, it checks if x is less than 4. If true, it goes to label 15 again. Wait, but 2 and 3 are primes. Oh, maybe the first check handles x < 2, then the second check handles x ==2 or x==3. If x is less than 4 but >=2, it's 2 or 3, which are primes, so it returns true.

If x is 4 or more, the code enters a loop. It initializes a phi node with 2. Then it computes the remainder of x divided by 6 (the phi node starts at 2 and increments by 1 each loop). If the remainder is zero, it checks if i squared is greater than x. If so, it returns true, indicating prime. Otherwise, it continues the loop.

Wait, no, the phi node starts at 2, then increments by 1 each time. So it's checking divisors up to sqrt(x). If any division has a remainder of zero, it's not prime. Otherwise, after the loop, it returns true.

So putting it all together, the function should return whether x is a prime number.

Now, translating this into C++. The function is_prime takes a long long x and returns a bool. It first handles x < 2 as false. Then checks if x is 2 or 3 as true. For x >=4, it loops from i=2 to sqrt(x), checking if x is divisible by i. If it is, returns false. Otherwise, returns true after the loop.

I think that's the correct approach. So the C++ code should reflect these steps accurately.

The provided LLVM IR code defines a function `_Z8is_primex` which checks if a given number is prime. Here's the decompiled C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

bool is_prime(long long x) {
    if (x < 2) {
        return false;
    }
    if (x < 4) {
        return true;
    }
    
    long long i = 2;
    while (true) {
        long long remainder = x % i;
        if (remainder == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        long long i_squared = (i + 1) * (i + 1);
        if (i_squared > x) {
            return true;
        }
        i++;
    }
}
```

This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number, efficiently determining primality.
