Alright, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++. Let me start by understanding what the function does.

The function is named @_Z9prime_fibi, which when demangled becomes "prime_fibi". It takes an i32 parameter and returns an i32. So, it's likely a function that computes something related to primes or Fibonacci numbers based on the input.

Looking at the IR, it starts with a loop. There's a phi node for %3, %4, and %5, which suggests that these variables are being updated each iteration. %3 and %4 seem to be Fibonacci numbers since they're adding each other. %5 is a counter that increments by 1 or 0 based on some condition.

In the loop, there's a check if %5 is less than the input %0. If it's true, the loop continues. Then, %7 is the sum of %4 and %3, which is the next Fibonacci number. There's a check if %4 is less than 4. If so, it branches back to the beginning of the loop; otherwise, it proceeds to another loop.

The inner loop starts by checking if %4 is divisible by %10. If it's not zero, it checks if the square of %10 is greater than %4. If either condition is true, it breaks out of the loop; otherwise, it continues. This looks like a primality test for %4.

Once the loops exit, the function returns %4, which seems to be the largest Fibonacci prime number less than or equal to the input.

I need to translate this logic into C++. I'll initialize variables a and b as the first two Fibonacci numbers. Then, in a loop, I'll compute the next Fibonacci number and check if it's prime. I'll keep track of the largest prime found and stop when the Fibonacci number exceeds the input.

Wait, in the IR, the condition for the inner loop is checking if the remainder is zero or if the square of the divisor exceeds the number. So, the inner loop is testing if %4 is a prime. If it finds a divisor, it breaks and marks it as not prime. Otherwise, it's prime.

I'll structure the C++ code with a while loop for generating Fibonacci numbers and a for loop for checking primality. I'll update the variables and check conditions accordingly. If a Fibonacci number is prime and less than or equal to n, I'll store it as the result. Once the Fibonacci number exceeds n, I'll return the last prime found.

I think I have all the pieces. Now, I'll write the C++ function step by step, making sure to handle all the conditions correctly.

The provided LLVM IR code appears to be a function named `prime_fibi` that calculates the largest Fibonacci prime number less than or equal to a given input `n`. Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int prime_fibi(int n) {
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    int result = 0;

    while (true) {
        if (b <= n) {
            bool is_prime = true;
            for (int i = 2; i * i <= b; ++i) {
                if (b % i == 0) {
                    is_prime = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (is_prime) {
                result = b;
            }
        }

        int next = a + b;
        if (next > n) {
            break;
        }
        a = b;
        b = next;
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << "Largest Fibonacci prime <= " << n << ": " << prime_fibi(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function `prime_fibi`:**
   - Initializes two variables `a` and `b` to 1 and 2, representing the first two Fibonacci numbers.
   - Uses a `while` loop to generate Fibonacci numbers until they exceed the input `n`.
   - For each Fibonacci number `b`, checks if it is a prime number using a nested `for` loop.
   - If `b` is prime and less than or equal to `n`, updates the `result`.
   - Continues generating the next Fibonacci number and updates `a` and `b`.
   - Returns the largest prime Fibonacci number found.

2. **Prime Check:**
   - For each Fibonacci number `b`, checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `b`.
   - If any divisor is found, marks `b` as non-prime.

3. **Main Function:**
   - Reads an integer input `n` from the user.
   - Calls `prime_fibi` with `n` and prints the result.

This C++ code should work similarly to the provided LLVM IR code, calculating the largest Fibonacci prime number less than or equal to the input value.
