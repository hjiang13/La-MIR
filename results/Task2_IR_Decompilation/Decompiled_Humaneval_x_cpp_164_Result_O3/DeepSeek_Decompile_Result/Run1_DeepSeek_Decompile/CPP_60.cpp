Alright, let me try to figure out how to decompile this LLVM IR code into C or C++. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I see that the IR code defines a function named `_Z8sum_to_ni` which returns an `i32` and takes an `i32` parameter. The function has several attributes like `mustprogress`, `nofree`, etc., which probably indicate optimization settings or constraints.

Looking at the function body, the first instruction is `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`. So, it's adding 1 to the input parameter `%0` and storing the result in `%2`. 

Next, `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0` multiplies the result of `%2` with the original input `%0`, storing it in `%3`. 

Then, `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2` divides `%3` by 2 using signed division and stores it in `%4`. 

Finally, `ret i32 %4` returns the value in `%4`.

Putting this together, the function computes `(n + 1) * n / 2`, which simplifies to `n*(n+1)/2`. That sounds familiarâ€”it's the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. So, the function is calculating the sum from 1 to n.

Now, to translate this into C++. The function takes an integer `n` and returns the sum. The C++ name for `_Z8sum_to_ni` would typically be `sum_to_n` with some name mangling, but when compiling, it should be accessible as `sum_to_n`.

I should write a function `int sum_to_n(int n)` that performs this calculation. The expression `n * (n + 1) / 2` directly translates the IR operations into C++. 

I might also want to include a `main` function to test it, just to make sure it works. In the `main` function, I can call `sum_to_n` with a sample value, say 10, and print the result to verify it.

Let me double-check the calculations. If `n` is 10, the sum should be 55. Using the formula: 10*11/2 = 55. That's correct.

I think that's all. The C++ code should be straightforward, implementing the formula and including a test case to demonstrate its usage.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the operations performed in the function and translate them into equivalent C++ code.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The IR defines a function `@_Z8sum_to_ni` that takes an `i32` (integer) parameter `%0` and returns an `i32`.
   - The function name `@_Z8sum_to_ni` is mangled. In C++, this corresponds to a function named `sum_to_n`.

2. **Operations Inside the Function**:
   - `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`: Adds 1 to the input parameter.
   - `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`: Multiplies the result by the original input.
   - `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`: Divides the product by 2 using signed division.
   - `ret i32 %4`: Returns the result.

3. **Translation to C++**:
   - These operations translate directly to the C++ expression `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - This is the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Create a function `int sum_to_n(int n)` that computes the sum using the formula.
   - Optionally, include a `main` function to test the `sum_to_n` function with an example value.

### Decompiled C++ Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int sum_to_n(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example input
    int result = sum_to_n(n);
    std::cout << "The sum of the first " << n << " natural numbers is: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **sum_to_n Function**:
  - Takes an integer `n` as input.
  - Computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
  - Returns the computed sum.

- **main Function**:
  - Demonstrates how to use `sum_to_n` by calculating the sum for `n = 10`.
  - Prints the result to the console.

This C++ code accurately reflects the behavior of the original LLVM IR code and can be compiled and executed directly.
