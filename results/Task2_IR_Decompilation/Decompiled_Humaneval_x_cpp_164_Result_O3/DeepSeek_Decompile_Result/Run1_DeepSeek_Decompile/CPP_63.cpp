Okay, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code is doing. 

Looking at the function definition, it's called _Z6fibfibi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, that might translate to something like fib(int) or similar. So the function takes an integer and returns an integer.

The function starts by allocating a block of memory for 100 integers with `alloca [100 x i32]`. It then uses `bitcast` to treat this memory as an i8 pointer, probably for managing the lifetime with LLVM's functions. There are calls to `llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`, which manage the memory's lifetime.

Next, it initializes some elements in the array. It stores 0 at index 0, 0 at index 1, and 1 at index 2. Then there's an `icmp slt` checking if the input is less than 3. If so, it branches to label 31, which loads the value from the array and returns it. Otherwise, it proceeds.

The code then enters a loop. It increments the input and checks if it's equal to 4, branching to 31 if true. Otherwise, it goes into another part where it checks if the incremented value is 5. If so, it branches to 19, else to 16.

At label 16, it's manipulating some pointers, subtracting 4 and using `and` with -2. Then it branches to 35. Label 35 seems to be a loop that updates some values and recalculates pointers. It's using phi nodes, which means it's handling values that come from different paths.

In label 19, there's a phi node for several variables, which suggests that this is a loop where values are being updated each iteration. It's loading values from the array, adding them together, and storing the result back. This seems like a Fibonacci calculation since it's adding previous elements.

The code uses getelementptr to access array elements, loads values, adds them, and stores the result. This pattern repeats with different indices, which makes me think it's filling up the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth element.

Finally, when the loop conditions are met, it exits, loads the result from the array based on the input, and returns it.

Putting this together, the function is initializing a Fibonacci array and iterating to compute the sequence up to the given index. It uses an array to store intermediate values, which is a common approach in iterative Fibonacci implementations.

So, the C++ code should declare an array of 100 integers, initialize the first few elements, and then loop to fill the rest up to the given n. It returns the nth Fibonacci number. The loop seems to handle both even and odd indices, hence the checks and different calculations based on the index's parity.

I need to translate these steps into C++. The function will take an integer n, initialize the array, and compute each Fibonacci number iteratively, storing them in the array. Then, it returns the nth value.

I should make sure to handle cases where n is less than 3 by returning the initialized value directly. For larger n, the loop runs from 3 up to n, computing each step based on previous values.

The use of phi nodes and multiple labels in the IR suggests that the C++ code might have conditional checks within the loop to handle different cases, perhaps for optimization or to follow a specific algorithm.

I'll structure the C++ code to mirror these steps: allocate the array, initialize, loop, compute, and return the result. I'll also make sure to handle the lifetime of the array correctly, though in C++ using a local array should manage that automatically.

Now, I'll write the C++ code that reflects this logic, ensuring that it's efficient and matches the IR's behavior.

To convert the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we analyze the operations and translate them into equivalent C++ constructs. The function appears to compute the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with an array to store intermediate values.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    int arr[100];
    arr[0] = 0;
    arr[1] = 0;
    arr[2] = 1;

    if (n < 3) {
        return arr[n];
    }

    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i == 4) {
            arr[i] = 1;
            continue;
        }

        if (i % 2 == 1) {
            arr[i] = arr[i - 2] + arr[i - 1];
        } else {
            int prev1 = arr[i - 1];
            int prev2 = arr[i - 2];
            arr[i - 1] = prev1 + prev2;
            arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + prev1;
        }
    }

    return arr[n];
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter n: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Fibonacci number is: " << fib(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** The function `fib` takes an integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
2. **Array Initialization:** An array `arr` of size 100 is initialized with the first three Fibonacci numbers.
3. **Base Cases:** If `n` is less than 3, the function returns the corresponding value directly from the array.
4. **Iterative Calculation:** For `n` greater than or equal to 3, the function iterates from 3 to `n`, computing each Fibonacci number.
   - For `i = 4`, it sets `arr[4]` to 1.
   - For odd indices, it computes `arr[i]` as the sum of the two preceding elements.
   - For even indices, it updates the preceding element before computing the current one.
5. **Return Result:** The function returns the nth Fibonacci number stored in `arr[n]`.

This C++ code mirrors the logic of the provided LLVM IR, efficiently computing the Fibonacci sequence using an iterative approach with an array for intermediate storage.
