Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code, and I need to decompile it into C++ that I can run. Hmm, I remember that LLVM IR is a low-level representation, so decompiling it might be a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the function definition. The function is named @_Z4fib4i, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using my knowledge of C++ name mangling, I can try to demangle it. The "_Z" prefix indicates a function, "4fib" suggests the function name is "fib" with 4 characters, and "4i" probably means it takes an integer argument. So, the function is likely "int fib(int)".

Looking at the function, it starts by allocating memory for an array of 100 integers. The code does this with %2 = alloca [100 x i32], which means it's creating a local array. Then it bitcasts this array to an i8* and calls llvm.lifetime.start to manage the lifetime of this allocation. That makes sense for proper memory management in C++.

Next, there's a bitcast to a <4 x i32>* type, which suggests SIMD operations, maybe using SSE since it's storing a vector of four integers. The initial store is <i32 0, i32 0, i32 2, i32 0>, so the array starts with some initial values, possibly setting up the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence.

The function then checks if the input %0 is less than 4. If it is, it branches to label 34, which seems to handle the base cases by loading the value directly from the array. If not, it proceeds to label 6.

At label 6, it increments the input by 1 and stores 2 in the 4th position of the array. Then it checks if the incremented value is 5. If so, it branches to label 34; otherwise, it goes to label 10. This seems like handling the base cases up to n=5.

Label 10 starts what looks like a loop. It checks if the original input is even or odd using zext and and operations. Depending on that, it branches to label 17 or 14. This might be optimizing the Fibonacci calculation based on whether n is even or odd, perhaps using some kind of doubling method.

In label 17, there are phi nodes indicating the start of a loop. It loads values from the array, performs some additions, and stores the result back. This loop seems to be calculating Fibonacci numbers iteratively, using previously computed values to build up the result.

Label 34 is where the function returns. It calculates the index based on the original input, loads the value from the array, ends the lifetime of the allocation, and returns the result.

Putting this together, the function initializes an array with base Fibonacci numbers and then iteratively computes higher values up to the input n, using SIMD for some operations and possibly employing an optimized algorithm for efficiency.

So, translating this into C++, the function would create a local array, initialize it, and then fill it up using a loop based on whether n is even or odd, optimizing the Fibonacci calculation. The use of SIMD might correspond to using __m128i types or similar in C++ for vector operations, but since the IR uses <4 x i32>, it's likely using 128-bit vectors.

Wait, but in the C++ code, I don't see any explicit SIMD types. Maybe the compiler optimized the loop into SIMD instructions, so in the source code, it's just a normal loop, and the SIMD is part of the compilation optimization. So, perhaps the original C++ code uses an iterative approach without explicit SIMD, and the compiler generated the vectorized code.

Alternatively, maybe the original code does use SIMD, but for the purpose of decompiling, I can write a standard iterative version since the SIMD details are compiler optimizations and not part of the source code.

So, the C++ function would look something like initializing an array, handling base cases, and then looping from 4 up to n, calculating each Fibonacci number and storing it in the array. Finally, it returns the nth Fibonacci number.

I should also note that the function uses an array of 100 elements, which suggests that it's designed to handle n up to 99. So, the function is likely intended for n within that range.

Putting it all together, the decompiled function would initialize the array, compute each Fibonacci number up to n, and return the result. The loop probably uses the relation F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), but maybe with some optimizations based on even and odd indices, as hinted by the IR code.

I think I've got a good grasp of the structure now. Time to write the C++ code that matches this behavior.

The provided LLVM IR code defines a function `fib` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with optimizations. Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fib(int n) {
    int fib_array[100]{0, 0, 2, 0};
    
    if (n < 4) {
        return fib_array[n];
    }
    
    fib_array[4] = 2;
    
    if (n == 5) {
        return 5;
    }
    
    for (int i = 6; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            fib_array[i] = fib_array[i - 1] + fib_array[i - 2];
        } else {
            fib_array[i] = fib_array[i - 1] + 2 * fib_array[i - 2] - fib_array[i - 3];
        }
    }
    
    return fib_array[n];
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Fibonacci number: " << fib(10) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:** The function initializes an array `fib_array` to store Fibonacci numbers, setting base cases.
- **Base Cases Handling:** Directly returns values for n < 4 and n = 5.
- **Iterative Calculation:** Uses a loop to compute Fibonacci numbers up to n, optimizing with different formulas for even and odd indices to reduce computation time.
- **Example Usage:** The `main` function demonstrates how to use `fib` by calculating the 10th Fibonacci number.

This code should compile and run correctly, producing the expected output for the given input.
