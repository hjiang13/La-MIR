Alright, I'm looking at the LLVM IR code provided and trying to understand what it's doing. The function is named @_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni, which when demangled gives me is_equal_to_sum_even. It takes an integer argument and returns a boolean.

First, I see that the function takes an i32 %0, which is the input integer. The first operation is %2 = and i32 %0, 1. This is computing the bitwise AND of the input with 1, which effectively checks if the least significant bit is 1. So, %2 will be 1 if the input is odd and 0 if it's even.

Next, %3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0. This is checking if %2 is equal to 0. So, %3 will be true (1) if the input is even, and false (0) otherwise.

Then, %4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7. This is comparing if the input is greater than 7. So, %4 will be true if the input is 8 or higher, false otherwise.

Finally, %5 = and i1 %4, %3. This is a logical AND between %4 and %3. So, %5 will be true only if both conditions are met: the input is even and greater than 7.

The function returns %5, which means it returns true if the input is an even number greater than 7, and false otherwise.

Now, translating this to C++. The function takes an int and returns a bool. The conditions are straightforward: check if the number is even (using & 1) and if it's greater than 7. Combining these with && gives the result.

I should also include the function signature, making sure to handle the integer parameter correctly. The function name is_equal_to_sum_even seems appropriate based on the demangled name.

Putting it all together, the C++ function should look like this:

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int num) {
    return (num > 7) && (num & 1) == 0;
}

This accurately reflects the logic in the LLVM IR code.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the function behavior and translate it accordingly. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Function Signature**: The function is named `is_equal_to_sum_even` and takes an integer parameter.

2. **Bitwise AND Operation**: The IR checks if the number is even by performing `num & 1`.

3. **Comparison**: It checks if the number is greater than 7 using `num > 7`.

4. **Logical AND**: The function returns `true` only if both conditions are met.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int num) {
    return (num > 7) && (num & 1) == 0;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << is_equal_to_sum_even(8) << std::endl;  // true
    std::cout << is_equal_to_sum_even(9) << std::endl;  // false
    std::cout << is_equal_to_sum_even(7) << std::endl;  // false
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the function and includes a `main` function with example usage. You can compile and run it directly.
