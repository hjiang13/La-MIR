Alright, I need to decompile the provided LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code is doing. 

First, I notice that the function is named `_Z9is_sortedSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which by C++ name mangling standards, corresponds to `is_sorted(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int>>)`. So the function is checking if a vector of integers is sorted.

Looking at the IR, the function takes a pointer to a `std::vector` and returns a boolean (`i1`). The vector's internal structure is accessed through its data pointers. The IR accesses the vector's data, size, and capacity, but since it's checking if it's sorted, it'll focus on the data.

The IR starts by getting the end pointer (`%3`) and the data pointer (`%5`). It calculates the distance between them, which gives the number of elements in the vector. If the vector has zero or one element, it exits early.

Then, it enters a loop comparing each element with the next. If any element is greater than the next, the function returns false. If the entire loop completes without finding any such case, it returns true.

I need to translate this logic into C++. The function will loop through the vector's elements, comparing each with the next. If any element is out of order, return false; otherwise, return true after the loop.

I should also handle the case where the vector is empty or has one element, which is trivially sorted.

So, the C++ code will look something like this: loop from the first to the second last element, compare each with the next. If any are out of order, return false. If the loop finishes, return true.

I should make sure to access the vector's data using `data()` method and use `size()` to get the number of elements. Also, handle the edge cases where the vector is empty or has one element.

Putting it all together, the function should be straightforward and efficient, similar to the IR's logic.

Based on the LLVM IR code, I will provide the equivalent C++ source code. The function `is_sorted` checks if a vector of integers is sorted in increasing order.

Here's the C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool is_sorted(const vector<int>& vec) {
    if (vec.size() <= 1) {
        return true;
    }
    
    const int* data = vec.data();
    size_t size = vec.size();
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < size - 1; ++i) {
        if (data[i] > data[i + 1]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `is_sorted` takes a `const vector<int>&` as input to avoid copying the vector.

2. **Edge Cases**: If the vector has zero or one element, it is trivially sorted, so the function returns `true`.

3. **Data Access**: The function accesses the vector's underlying data array using `data()` and gets its size using `size()`.

4. **Loop Through Elements**: The loop iterates through each element (except the last one) and checks if the current element is greater than the next one. If such a case is found, the vector is not sorted, and the function returns `false`.

5. **Return True**: If the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements, the function returns `true`, indicating the vector is sorted.

This code efficiently checks if the vector is sorted in increasing order with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector.
