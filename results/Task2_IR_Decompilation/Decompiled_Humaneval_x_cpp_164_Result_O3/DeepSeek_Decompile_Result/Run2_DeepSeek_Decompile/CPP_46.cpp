Okay, so I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's start by looking at the IR code provided. The function is named @_Z4fib4i, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, that would translate to a function called fib4 with an int parameter, so probably something like int fib4(int).

Looking at the IR, the function starts by allocating space for a [100 x i32] array. It then bitcasts this to an i8* and calls llvm.lifetime.start to manage the stack allocation. Next, it stores some initial values into the array using a vector store of <4 x i32> with the values 0, 0, 2, 0. 

There's a conditional branch checking if the input is less than 4, which would jump to label 34, otherwise it proceeds. Label 6 seems to handle some initial setup, storing a 2 at index 4. Then it checks if the incremented input (7) is 5, branching to 34 if so, else entering a loop.

The loop has some complex logic with multiple phi nodes, which suggests there are variables being updated each iteration. It looks like it's calculating Fibonacci numbers using some kind of memoization or dynamic programming with the array. The loop continues until certain conditions are met, updating the array values each time.

After the loop, the function loads the value from the array at position %35 (which is the original input) and returns it.

Putting this together, the function initializes an array, sets some base cases, then uses a loop to fill in the rest of the Fibonacci numbers up to the input value. The final result is taken from the array at the position corresponding to the input.

So the C++ code would have a function that creates an array of 100 integers, initializes the first few elements, then loops to compute each Fibonacci number based on previous values, and finally returns the nth Fibonacci number from the array.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we analyze the structure and operations. The function calculates the 4th Fibonacci number using memoization with an array.

**Decompiled C++ Code:**

```cpp
#include <cstdint>

int fib4(int n) {
    int fib_array[100];
    
    // Initialize the array with some values
    *(reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(fib_array)) = 0x20000000; // Stores 0, 0, 2, 0 in vector form
    
    if (n < 4) {
        return fib_array[n];
    }
    
    fib_array[4] = 2;
    
    for (int i = 5; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i == 5) {
            fib_array[i] = 2;
        } else {
            fib_array[i] = fib_array[i-1] + fib_array[i-3] + fib_array[i-4];
        }
    }
    
    return fib_array[n];
}
```

This code initializes an array to store Fibonacci numbers, sets base cases, and iteratively computes each subsequent number up to `n` using previous values, finally returning the nth Fibonacci number.
