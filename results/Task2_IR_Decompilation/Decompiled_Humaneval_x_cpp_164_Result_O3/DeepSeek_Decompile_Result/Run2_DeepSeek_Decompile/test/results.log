Also, after dividing by i, we should skip any multiples of i to avoid duplicate factors. But I'm not sure if the code does that. Looking back, the loop increments i each time, so maybe it's sufficient.

   22 | So, based on this analysis, I can start writing the C++ code. It will define a function make_a_pile that takes a vector by reference and an integer n. It will initialize the vector's internal pointers, allocate memory as needed, and fill the vector with the appropriate values. The loop will run from 1 to n, adding 2 each time, and handle any necessary reallocations to ensure the vector can hold all elements.

    4 | First, looking at the IR code, I see that it's a function named `_Z8is_primex(i64 %0)`. From what I remember, in C++, when functions are compiled, their names get mangled. So I think this function is probably `bool is_prime(int x)` or something similar, but taking a 64-bit integer.

./CPP_31.cpp:65:1: error: ‘Wait’ does not name a type
   65 | Wait, but in the IR code, the loop continues until i*i > x, and if any remainder is zero, it sets result based on whether i*i > x, which would be false if i is a divisor beyond sqrt(x). Wait, no, if i is a divisor and i*i > x, then x must be less than i*i, which would mean that i is greater than sqrt(x), but since we've already checked up to sqrt(x), any divisor beyond that would have a corresponding divisor below sqrt(x). So perhaps the logic is that if a remainder is found and i*i > x, then x is a prime.
      | ^~~~
./CPP_31.cpp:138:345: error: expected unqualified-id before ‘else’
  138 | So, the function starts by checking if x is less than 2, returns false. Then, if x is less than 4, returns true (so 2 and 3 are primes). Then, it enters a loop starting at 2, increments by 1 each time. For each i, it checks if x is divisible by i. If it is, then it checks if (i+1)^2 is greater than x. If yes, then it sets the result to true; else, it continues the loop. If it's not divisible, it continues the loop. The loop exits when (i+1)^2 > x.

./CPP_31.cpp:168:1: error: ‘Wait’ does not name a type
  168 | Wait, but this doesn't seem right because if x is divisible by any i, it would set result to whether (i+1)^2 > x, which would be true only if i is greater than sqrt(x). But if i is a divisor and greater than sqrt(x), then x must be i, which is not possible since x is greater than i. So, perhaps this function has a bug.

  247 | But wait, in the IR code, after each iteration, it increments i by 1. So the loop continues until (i+1)^2 > x. So the condition is while (i+1)^2 <= x, which can be written as i <= sqrt(x) - 1.
