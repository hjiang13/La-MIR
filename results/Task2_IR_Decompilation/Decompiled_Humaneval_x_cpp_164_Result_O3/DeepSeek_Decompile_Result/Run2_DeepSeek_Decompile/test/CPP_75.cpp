<think>
Okay, so I'm looking at this LLVM IR code, and I need to decompile it back into C or C++ code. Let me take it step by step.

First, the function is called _Z17is_multiply_primei, which I think is a C++ mangled name. Using a demangler, this should translate to something like is_multiply_prime(int). So the function takes an integer and returns a bool.

Looking at the code, the function starts by comparing the input %0 with 4. If it's less than 4, it branches to label 11. Otherwise, it goes to label 3. So the initial check is if the number is less than 4. If so, it checks if it's 2, which would return true, else false, I think.

In label 3, there are phi nodes for variables %4, %5, %6. Phi nodes are used for values that come from multiple predecessors, so I need to track where each comes from. %4 seems to be the loop counter, %5 a counter, and %6 the number being checked.

Then, the code computes the remainder of %6 divided by %4. If the remainder is 0 and %6 is greater than %4, it branches to label 14. Otherwise, it goes back to label 23.

In label 14, it updates some variables, recomputes the remainder, and checks again. If the conditions are met, it loops back to 14; otherwise, it goes to 23.

Label 23 seems to update the loop variables. It increments %4, squares it, and checks if the square is greater than %24. If so, it branches to 11, else back to 3.

Putting it all together, it looks like the function is checking if a number is a "multiply prime." I remember that a multiply prime is a number whose prime factors are all distinct and greater than 1. So, numbers like 6 (2*3), 10 (2*5), etc., are multiply primes, while 4 (2*2) is not.

The algorithm seems to iterate through possible factors, checking divisibility and ensuring that each factor is only used once. The loop starts at 2 and goes up, checking each divisor. If any divisor divides the number more than once, it's not a multiply prime.

Now, translating this into C++. The function will take an integer and return a bool. The initial check handles numbers less than 4. Then, for each number starting from 2, it checks if it's a divisor, and whether it divides the number exactly once. If any such divisor is found that divides the number more than once, it returns false. Otherwise, after checking all possible divisors, it returns true.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking if the remainder is zero and if the divisor is less than the number. Then, in the loop, it increments the divisor and continues. So the C++ code should implement this logic.

I need to make sure that the loop correctly handles the cases where the divisor squared exceeds the remaining number. Also, the function should return false if any divisor divides the number more than once, else return true.

So, the function should start by handling the base cases (n < 4). Then, for each i starting from 2, check if i divides n. If it does, then check if i divides n/i again. If yes, return false. Also, after dividing by i, we should skip any multiples of i to avoid duplicate factors. But I'm not sure if the code does that. Looking back, the loop increments i each time, so maybe it's sufficient.

Wait, the code in label 23 increments the divisor, which is %4, by 1 each time. So it's checking each integer starting from 2 upwards. For each i, it checks if i divides the number. If i divides, then it checks if i divides the quotient again. If yes, returns false. Otherwise, it continues.

So the C++ function should look something like:

bool is_multiply_prime(int n) {
    if (n < 2) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i*i <= n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            if (n / i % i == 0) return false;
            n /= i;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, but the code in the IR seems to have more steps. Let me check again.

In the IR, after finding a divisor, it divides n by i and continues. But perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the IR again.

In label 3, it calculates %7 as the remainder of %6 divided by %4. If %7 is 0 and %6 > %4, it goes to label 14. Else, it goes to label 23.

In label 14, it updates %15 and %16, then computes %17 as %16 divided by %4, %18 as %15 +1, then checks %17 %4 again. If it divides and is greater, it loops again.

This suggests that when a divisor is found, the code is checking if the quotient is still divisible by the same divisor, which would indicate a square factor, making it not a multiply prime.

So, perhaps the code is checking for square factors. If any square factor exists, it's not a multiply prime.

Thus, the C++ function should return true only if the number has no square factors, i.e., it's square-free and has at least one prime factor.

Wait, but 1 has no prime factors, so it should return false. Also, primes themselves have no square factors, so they should return true.

So, the function is checking if the number is square-free and greater than 1.

Wait, but that's different from multiply primes. Because multiply primes require that all prime factors are distinct, which is the same as square-free.

So, yes, the function is checking if the number is square-free and greater than 1.

So, the C++ code can be written as:

bool is_multiply_prime(int n) {
    if (n < 2)
        return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            if ((n / i) % i == 0)
                return false;
            while (n % i == 0)
                n /= i;
        }
    }
    return n > 1;
}

Wait, but the original code might not have that while loop. Let me see.

In the IR, after finding a divisor i, it sets %17 to n/i, then continues. It doesn't loop to remove all factors of i, but just checks once. So perhaps the code is only checking the first occurrence.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me try to simulate with an example.

Take n=12.

In the first iteration, i=2.

n % 2 ==0, so check if (12/2) %2 ==0. 6%2=0, so return false.

So function returns false, which is correct since 12=2^2*3.

Another example, n=6.

i=2: 6%2==0. Check 3%2!=0, so proceed. Then i increments.

Next i=3: 3*3=9>6. Loop ends. Return true, since n>1.

Which is correct, 6 is a multiply prime.

Another example, n=4.

i=2: 4%2==0. Check 2%2==0, so return false. Correct.

n=2: function returns true.

n=1: returns false.

n=9: i=2, no. i=3: 9%3==0, check 3%3==0, return false. Correct.

n=10: i=2, 10/2=5, 5%2!=0. i=3: 3^2=9<=10. 10%3!=0. i=4: 4^2=16>10. Return true. Correct.

So the code seems to handle these cases.

Thus, the C++ function should be:

bool is_multiply_prime(int n) {
    if (n < 2)
        return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            if ((n / i) % i == 0)
                return false;
            // Remove all factors of i
            while (n % i == 0)
                n /= i;
        }
    }
    return n > 1;
}

Wait, but in the IR code, after finding a divisor, it doesn't loop to remove all factors. So perhaps the code is different.

Looking back, the IR code in label 3:

%7 = srem i32 %6, %4 --> n mod i
%8 = icmp eq i32 %7, 0
%9 = icmp sgt i32 %6, %4 --> n > i
%10 = and i1 %9, %8 --> if n mod i ==0 and n >i
br i1 %10, label %14, label %23

So if n mod i ==0 and n >i, it goes to label14.

In label14:

%15 = phi i32 [ %18, %14 ], [ %5, %3 ]
%16 = phi i32 [ %17, %14 ], [ %6, %3 ]
%17 = sdiv i32 %16, %4 --> n/i
%18 = add nsw i32 %15, 1 --> some counter
%19 = srem i32 %17, %4
%20 = icmp eq i32 %19, 0
%21 = icmp sgt i32 %17, %4
%22 = and i1 %21, %20
br i1 %22, label %14, label %23

So in label14, it's checking if (n/i) mod i ==0 and (n/i) >i. If so, loop again. Else, go to 23.

This seems to be checking if the quotient has the same factor again. So, if after dividing by i once, the quotient is still divisible by i, then it's a square factor.

So the code is checking for any square factors, not just the first occurrence. So for n=12, it would find 2, then check 6, which is still divisible by 2, so return false.

Similarly, for n=18=2*3*3, it would find 2, then check 9, which is divisible by 3, but since 3 !=2, it would proceed, but then when i=3, it would find 3 divides 9, and then check 3 again, which would have (3/3)=1, which is not >3, so it wouldn't trigger. Wait, but 3 divides 9, and 9/3=3, which is equal, so the condition (n/i) >i would be false. So it wouldn't return false there. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the case of n=18:

i=2: 18 mod 2=0, 18>2. So go to label14.

In label14: compute 18/2=9. Then check if 9 mod 2 ==0? No, so it goes to label23.

In label23: increment i to 3. Now, check 18 mod3=0, 18>3. Go to label14.

Compute 18/3=6. Check 6 mod3=0, and 6>3. So go to label14 again.

Compute 6/3=2. Check 2 mod3 !=0, so go to label23.

Increment i to4. 4^2=16 >2? No, 16>2 is true, but wait, n is now 2. So 4^2=16 >2, so loop ends. Return true.

Wait, but 18=2*3^2, which has a square factor, so function should return false. But according to this, it returns true. That can't be right. So perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the code is not correctly handling all square factors. Or perhaps I made a mistake in simulating.

Wait, let's re-simulate with n=18.

Start with n=18.

i=2:

n mod2=0, 18>2, so go to label14.

In label14: compute 18/2=9. Check 9 mod2=1, which is not 0. So %20 is false, %22 is false, so go to label23.

In label23: increment i to3. Now, check 18 mod3=0, 18>3. Go to label14.

In label14: compute 18/3=6. Check 6 mod3=0. Also, 6>3 is true. So %20 and %21 are true, so %22 is true. So it loops back to label14.

Now, in label14 again: compute 6/3=2. Check 2 mod3=2 !=0. So %20 is false, go to label23.

In label23: increment i to4. Now, i=4. Check 4^2=16 >2? Yes, so branch to label11.

In label11: %12 is 0. Check if 0==2? No, so return false.

Wait, so the function returns false for n=18. That's correct because 18 has a square factor 3^2.

So my initial simulation was wrong because I didn't consider that after the second division by 3, it goes back to label23, increments i to4, and then exits the loop.

So the code correctly returns false for n=18.

Thus, the C++ code should correctly handle all cases.

So, the function should:

- Return false if n <2.

- For each i from 2 up, check if i divides n.

- If i divides n, check if i divides n/i again. If yes, return false.

- Otherwise, divide n by i and continue.

- After checking all i up to sqrt(n), return true if n is greater than 1.

So the code I wrote earlier should be correct.

Wait, but in the code I wrote, after finding a divisor, I remove all factors of i by doing a while loop. But in the IR code, it only checks once. So perhaps the code in the IR doesn't do that, which might be a problem.

Wait, let's see. Suppose n=12. The code in the IR would find i=2, check that 12/2=6 is divisible by 2, so return false. Correct.

But for n=18, it would find i=2, n becomes 9, then i=3, n becomes 6, then i=3 again, n becomes 2, then i=4, exit loop, return true. Wait, but that's not correct because 18 has a square factor.

Wait, no. Because in the IR code, when i=3, n=18, it finds 18 mod3=0, then in label14, it computes 18/3=6, then checks 6 mod3=0 and 6>3, so it loops back to label14. Then, it computes 6/3=2, and checks 2 mod3=2 !=0, so goes to label23. Then i increments to4, and since 4^2=16>2, it branches to label11, which returns false.

So the code correctly returns false for 18.

But if I use the C++ code I wrote, which after finding i=3, would do a while loop to divide out all 3s, making n=2, and then the loop would end, returning true. Which is wrong.

Wait, that's a problem. So my initial C++ code is incorrect because it removes all factors of i, which skips checking if any higher multiples of i exist.

So, perhaps the correct approach is not to remove all factors of i, but only to check once. Because if you remove all factors, you might miss that a higher multiple of i could still be a factor.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because once you divide by i, any higher multiple of i would have been accounted for.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

In the IR code, when i=3 and n=18, it finds that 3 divides 18, then checks if 6 (18/3) is divisible by 3 again. Since it is, it returns false.

In my C++ code, when i=3, n=18, I check if 6 is divisible by 3, which it is, so return false. So both codes would return false for 18.

Wait, but in my C++ code, I have a while loop that divides n by i until it's no longer divisible. So for n=18, i=3, after dividing once, n becomes 6, and then the while loop continues, dividing 6 by3 again, making n=2. Then the loop continues with i=4.

Wait, but in the C++ code, the function would have already returned false when i=3 because (n/i) %i ==0.

So the C++ code would correctly return false for 18.

Wait, let me re-examine the C++ code:

if (n % i ==0) {
    if ((n / i) %i ==0)
        return false;
    while (n %i ==0)
        n /=i;
}

So for n=18, i=3:

n%3==0, so check (18/3)=6 %3==0? Yes, so return false.

Thus, the function correctly returns false.

Another example, n=45=3^2*5.

i=3: 45%3==0, check 15%3==0, return false. Correct.

Another example, n=30=2*3*5.

i=2: 30%2==0, check 15%2!=0. So proceed, divide 30 by2 once, n=15.

i=3: 15%3==0, check 5%3!=0. So proceed, divide 15 by3 once, n=5.

i=4: 4^2=16>5. Exit loop, return true. Correct.

So the C++ code seems to handle these cases correctly.

Thus, the correct C++ code is as I wrote earlier.

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given integer is a "multiply prime." A number is considered a multiply prime if it has no repeated prime factors. This means that all its prime factors must be distinct.

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Check**: If the number is less than 2, it cannot be a multiply prime,
#undef NDEBUG
#include<assert.h>
int main(){
    assert (is_multiply_prime(5) == false);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(30) == true);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(8) == true);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(10) == false);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(125) == true);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(3 * 5 * 7) == true);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(3 * 6 * 7) == false);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(9 * 9 * 9) == false);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(11 * 9 * 9) == false);
    assert (is_multiply_prime(11 * 13 * 7) == true);
}
