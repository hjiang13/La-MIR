Okay, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++. Let me start by understanding what the function does.

Looking at the IR, the function is named @_Z9fizz_buzzi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Demangling it, I get "fizz_buzzi" as the function name. So, it's a C++ function that takes an integer and returns an integer.

The function starts by checking if the input is greater than 0. If it's not, it goes to block 3, which returns 0. So, for non-positive numbers, the function returns 0.

If the input is positive, it goes to block 5. Here, there are some phi nodes, which suggests loops. The code uses urem (unsigned remainder) to compute modulo 11 and 13. It checks if both remainders are not zero, which means the number is divisible by neither 11 nor 13. 

If both conditions are true, it checks if the number is zero, but since we're in the positive block, that's probably a back edge. Then it branches to block 24, which increments the number and loops back. Otherwise, it goes to block 15.

In block 15, it takes the current number, checks if the remainder when divided by 10 is 7. If so, it adds 1 to a sum. Then it divides the number by 10 and loops until the number is less than 10.

Putting this together, the function seems to count how many digits in the number are 7, but only for numbers not divisible by 11 or 13. If the number is divisible by either, it returns 0.

Wait, no, actually, the function returns the count of 7s only if the number isn't divisible by 11 or 13. If it is divisible by either, it returns 0. Otherwise, it counts the 7s.

So, the C++ function should implement this logic. It should loop through each digit of the number, count the 7s, but only return the count if the number isn't divisible by 11 or 13. Otherwise, return 0.

I think that's the correct logic. Now, I'll write the C++ code that does this.

The provided LLVM IR corresponds to a function named `fizz_buzzi` that takes an integer and returns an integer. The function appears to implement custom logic related to the "FizzBuzz" problem, but with specific modifications. 

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fizz_buzzi(int num) {
    if (num <= 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    int count = 0;
    int n = num;

    while (n > 0) {
        int remainder_11 = num % 11;
        int remainder_13 = num % 13;
        
        if (remainder_11 != 0 && remainder_13 != 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            if (digit == 7) {
                count++;
            }
            n /= 10;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << fizz_buzzi(7) << std::endl;   // Example usage
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**: The function `fizz_buzzi` takes an integer `num` as input and returns an integer.

2. **Initial Check**: If the input `num` is less than or equal to 0, the function immediately returns 0.

3. **Loop Through Digits**: The function uses a while loop to process each digit of `num`:
   - It calculates the remainders when `num` is divided by 11 and 13.
   - If `num` is not divisible by either 11 or 13, it checks the last digit of `n` (a copy of `num`).
   - If the last digit is 7, it increments the count.
   - It then removes the last digit by dividing `n` by 10.

4. **Divisibility Check**: If at any point `num` is divisible by either 11 or 13, the function returns 0 immediately.

5. **Return Count**: After processing all digits, the function returns the count of 7s found.

6. **Example Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates how to use `fizz_buzzi` by passing the number 7 and printing the result.

This code should be saved with a `.cpp` extension and can be compiled and run using a C++ compiler.
