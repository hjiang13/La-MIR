Alright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to decompile some LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. The user provided the IR code for a function called `_Z7iscuberi`, which I think is a mangled name. Let me start by understanding what this function does.

First, I notice that the function takes an `i32` argument, which is a 32-bit integer, and returns a `zeroext i1`, which is a boolean. The function is named `iscuberi`, so I'm guessing it checks if a number is a cube. That makes sense because the function calculates something related to cubes.

Looking at the IR code, the function starts by calling `llvm.abs.i32` on the input, which gives the absolute value. This is stored in `%2`. Then it enters a loop where it initializes `%4` to 0. In each iteration, it calculates `%5` as `%4` squared and `%6` as `%4` cubed. It checks if `%6` is less than `%2`. If true, it increments `%4` and loops again; otherwise, it exits.

After the loop, there's a check to see if `%6` is less than or equal to `%2`. If so, it returns true; otherwise, false. So the function is checking if the absolute value of the input is a perfect cube.

Now, to convert this into C++. The function is named `iscuberi`, but in C++ the mangled name would be `bool isCube(int)`. So I'll write a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.

I'll need to handle the absolute value, so I'll include `<cstdlib>` for `abs()`. The loop will start at 0 and keep incrementing until the cube exceeds the absolute value. Finally, I'll check if the cube is exactly the absolute value and return the result accordingly.

Putting it all together, I'll write a function that does these steps and test it with some examples to make sure it works correctly.

Here's the C++ source code that corresponds to the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>

bool isCube(int n) {
    int abs_n = std::abs(n);
    int i = 0;
    while (true) {
        int cube = i * i * i;
        if (cube > abs_n) {
            break;
        }
        ++i;
    }
    return (i * i * i == abs_n);
}

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     // Test cases
//     bool result1 = isCube(8);   // Should return true (2^3)
//     bool result2 = isCube(9);   // Should return false
//     return 0;
// }
```

### Explanation:
The function `isCube` checks if a given integer `n` is a perfect cube. Here's how it works:

1. **Absolute Value**: Since the function works with both positive and negative numbers, it starts by taking the absolute value of `n`.

2. **Loop to Find Cube**: It initializes a counter `i` to 0 and enters a loop where it calculates `i * i * i` (the cube of `i`). If the cube exceeds the absolute value of `n`, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Check for Perfect Cube**: After exiting the loop, it checks if the cube of `i` equals the absolute value of `n`. If it does, `n` is a perfect cube, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

This function efficiently determines whether a number is a perfect cube by iterating through possible cube roots and checking against the absolute value of the input.
