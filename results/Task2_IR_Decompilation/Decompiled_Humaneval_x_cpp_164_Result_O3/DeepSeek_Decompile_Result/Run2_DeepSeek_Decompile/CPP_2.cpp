Okay, I'm trying to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C or C++ source code. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, I see that the IR defines a function named `_Z15truncate_numberf` which takes a float as an argument and returns a float. The function has some attributes like mustprogress, nofree, etc., but I can ignore those for now since they're more about optimization and not the logic.

Looking at the function body, the first instruction is `%2 = fptosi float %0 to i32`. This converts the input float `%0` to an integer. So, in C, that would be something like `int truncated = static_cast<int>(x);` where x is the input float.

Next, `%3 = sitofp i32 %2 to float` converts the integer back to a float. So that would be `float truncated_float = static_cast<float>(truncated);`.

Then, `%4 = fsub float %0, %3` subtracts the truncated float from the original input. In C, that's `return x - truncated_float;`.

Putting it all together, the function takes a float, truncates it to an integer, converts it back to float, and subtracts that from the original to get the fractional part.

I should also consider the naming. The function name in IR is `_Z15truncate_numberf`, which when demangled gives `float truncate_number(float)`. So the function name in C would be `truncate_number`.

I need to make sure the function is declared as `float truncate_number(float x)` and inside, perform the truncation and subtraction.

I might also want to test the function with some examples to ensure it works as expected. For instance, if x is 3.5, the truncated part is 3.0, so the result should be 0.5.

Wait, but in C++, using `static_cast<int>` truncates towards zero, which is the same as the IR's fptosi. So that should be correct.

I think that's all. The code should be straightforward.

The given LLVM IR code defines a function `truncate_number` that computes the fractional part of a floating-point number. Here's the equivalent C++ source code:

```cpp
float truncate_number(float x) {
    int truncated = static_cast<int>(x);
    float truncated_float = static_cast<float>(truncated);
    return x - truncated_float;
}
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `truncate_number` takes a single `float` argument `x` and returns a `float`.

2. **Truncation to Integer:**
   - `int truncated = static_cast<int>(x);` converts `x` to an integer, effectively truncating the decimal part.

3. **Convert Back to Float:**
   - `float truncated_float = static_cast<float>(truncated);` converts the truncated integer back to a float.

4. **Compute Fractional Part:**
   - `return x - truncated_float;` subtracts the truncated float from the original to get the fractional part.

**Example Use Case:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    float x = 3.5f;
    float fractional_part = truncate_number(x);
    std::cout << "Fractional part of " << x << " is " << fractional_part << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code will output `0.5`, demonstrating the correct extraction of the fractional part from the input float.
