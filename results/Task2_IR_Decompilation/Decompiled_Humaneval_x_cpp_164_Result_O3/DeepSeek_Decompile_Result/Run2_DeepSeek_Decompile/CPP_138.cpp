Alright, I'm trying to help the user decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's see, the IR code defines a function called `_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni` which takes an `i32` parameter and returns a `i1`. 

First, I notice that the function uses some bitwise operations. The IR starts with `%2 = and i32 %0, 1`, which suggests it's checking the least significant bit of the input. If the result is 0, that means the number is even. Then, `%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7` checks if the input is greater than 7. 

Putting it together, the function returns true only if both conditions are met: the number is even and greater than 7. So, in C++, this would translate to a boolean function that checks if the number is even and greater than 7.

I should also consider the naming. The mangled function name `_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni` likely corresponds to a function named `is_equal_to_sum_even` in C++. 

So, the final C++ code would be a function that returns whether the input is even and greater than 7. I'll write that out, making sure to use proper syntax and comments for clarity.

The given LLVM IR code defines a function `is_equal_to_sum_even` that takes an integer argument and returns a boolean. Let's break down what the function does:

1. It checks if the least significant bit of the input is 0 (`%2 = and i32 %0, 1` and `%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0`), which determines if the number is even.
2. It checks if the number is greater than 7 (`%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7`).
3. It returns true only if both conditions are true (`%5 = and i1 %4, %3`).

Here's the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <stdbool.h>

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int num) {
    bool is_even = (num & 1) == 0;
    bool is_greater_than_7 = num > 7;
    return is_even && is_greater_than_7;
}
```

This code defines a function `is_equal_to_sum_even` that returns `true` if the input number is even and greater than 7, and `false` otherwise.
