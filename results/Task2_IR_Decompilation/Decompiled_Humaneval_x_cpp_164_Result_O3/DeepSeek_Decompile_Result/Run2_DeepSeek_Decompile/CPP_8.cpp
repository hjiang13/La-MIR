Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR is doing.

Looking at the function definition, it's a function called _Z11sum_productSt6vectorIiSaIiEE, which I think is the mangled name for a function. Demangling that, it probably becomes something like sum_product(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int>>). So the function takes two vectors and returns a vector.

The function starts by getting the elements of the input vector %1. It loads the start and end pointers of the vector's data. Then it calculates the difference between these pointers to get the size, which is stored in %9. It checks if this size is zero and branches accordingly.

If the size is zero, it goes to label 91, which seems to handle the case where the result is an empty vector. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate how much of the loop can be vectorized. It computes %12 as the size divided by 4 (since it's using vectors of 4 elements), ensures it's at least 1, and checks if it's less than 8. If it is, it goes into a loop that uses SIMD instructions for the product sum.

In the SIMD loop (starting at label 24), it's loading chunks of 4 elements from both the input and another array (probably the second vector), performing multiplication and addition using vector operations. These operations accumulate into the result vector.

If the size isn't a multiple of 4, there's a remainder loop starting at label 105. This loop handles the remaining elements that couldn't be processed in chunks of 4, using scalar operations.

After processing all elements, the function constructs the result vector. It initializes the vector with the accumulated sum and product, and returns it.

Putting this together, I think the original C++ code is a function that takes two vectors of integers and returns a new vector where each element is the sum of the products of corresponding elements up to that point. So, for each index i, result[i] = sum_{k=0 to i} (a[k] * b[k]).

The scalar loop in the IR suggests that for each element beyond the vectorized part, it's adding the product of a[i] and b[i] to the sum and multiplying them for the product. The vectorized part does this in chunks of four for efficiency.

So, the C++ code should have a similar structure: handle the majority of the elements with SIMD for speed and then clean up any remaining elements with a regular loop.

The provided LLVM IR corresponds to a C++ function named `sum_product` that calculates the cumulative sum of products between corresponding elements of two input vectors. Here's the reconstructed source code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <immintrin.h>  // For SIMD operations

using namespace std;

vector<int> sum_product(const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (a.empty()) {
        return result;
    }

    int sum = 0;
    int product = 1;
    size_t n = a.size();

    // Vectorized part (handles chunks of 4 elements)
    size_t vec_size = (n / 4) * 4;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < vec_size; i += 4) {
        __m128i a_vec = _mm_loadu_si128(reinterpret_cast<const __m128i*>(&a[i]));
        __m128i b_vec = _mm_loadu_si128(reinterpret_cast<const __m128i*>(&b[i]));

        __m128i product_vec = _mm_mul_epi32(a_vec, b_vec);
        __m128i sum_vec = _mm_add_epi32(a_vec, b_vec);

        int* product_ptr = reinterpret_cast<int>(&product_vec);
        int* sum_ptr = reinterpret_cast<int>(&sum_vec);

        sum += sum_ptr[0] + sum_ptr[1] + sum_ptr[2] + sum_ptr[3];
        product *= product_ptr[0] * product_ptr[1] * product_ptr[2] * product_ptr[3];
    }

    // Remainder part (handles remaining elements)
    for (size_t i = vec_size; i < n; ++i) {
        sum += a[i] + b[i];
        product *= a[i] * b[i];
    }

    result.push_back(sum);
    result.push_back(product);

    return result;
}
```

This code defines a function `sum_product` that takes two `vector<int>` arguments and returns a new `vector<int>`. The function calculates the cumulative sum of the element-wise sum and product of the two input vectors. It uses SIMD instructions for vectorized processing of four elements at a time to optimize performance, followed by a scalar loop to handle any remaining elements that don't fit into the vectorized processing.
