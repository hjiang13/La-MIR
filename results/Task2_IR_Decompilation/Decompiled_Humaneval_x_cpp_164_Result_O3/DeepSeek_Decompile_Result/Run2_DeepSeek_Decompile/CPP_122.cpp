Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the IR is doing. 

Looking at the function definition, it's a function called _Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi, which I think translates to a function named add_elements that takes a std::vector<int> and an int. The function returns an int.

First, the function starts with some checks. The initial check is whether the input integer %1 is greater than 0. If not, it branches to label 86, which seems to be the exit point. So, if %1 is <=0, the function returns 0.

Assuming %1 is positive, it proceeds to label 4. It gets the element pointer of the vector, which I think is accessing the underlying array. Then it loads the pointer into %6. It converts %1 to i64 and checks if it's less than 8. If it is, it goes to label 83, which might be the scalar part. Otherwise, it proceeds to label 9.

In label 9, there's some bit manipulation. It looks like it's calculating how many full vector lanes it can process. The code uses SIMD instructions to process elements in groups of 4, which makes sense for vectorization.

The loop starts at label 16, where it processes the vector in chunks of 4 elements. It uses phi nodes to accumulate the results. Each iteration loads two sets of 4 elements, adds 99 to them, checks if they're less than 199, and accumulates the valid elements.

After processing the main vector part, it checks if there are any remaining elements that couldn't fill a full vector. If so, it processes them scalarly in label 62. Then, it sums up all the valid elements using a vector reduce operation.

If the initial %1 was less than 8, it processes each element one by one in label 88, adding 99 and checking against 199.

Putting it all together, the function is adding 99 to each element in the vector and counting how many elements are less than 199 after the addition. The count is then returned.

Now, translating this into C++. The function will take a vector and an integer n, loop through the first n elements, add 99 to each, and count how many are less than 199. The loop will include both vectorized and scalar parts if necessary, but in C++, we can use a simple loop since the compiler will handle vectorization.

I should write a function that does this, ensuring it's efficient and matches the IR's logic. The function will return the count of elements meeting the condition.

Based on the provided LLVM IR code, the function `add_elements` appears to add a value to elements of a vector and perform some conditional checks. Here's the reconstructed C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

int add_elements(std::vector<int>& vec, int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (vec[i] + 99 < 199) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

**Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Function Signature**: The function takes a `std::vector<int>` and an `int n`, returning an `int`.

2. **Loop Through Elements**: Iterate over the first `n` elements of the vector.

3. **Condition Check**: For each element, check if adding 99 results in a value less than 199.

4. **Count Valid Elements**: Increment the count for each element that satisfies the condition.

5. **Return Count**: The total count is returned as the result.

This code accurately reflects the operations performed in the provided IR, handling both vectorized and scalar operations through a straightforward loop.
