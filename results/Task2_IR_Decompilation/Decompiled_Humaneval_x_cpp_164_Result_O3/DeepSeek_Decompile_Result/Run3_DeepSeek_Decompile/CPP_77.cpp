Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the IR code is doing.

Looking at the function `_Z7iscuberi(i32 %0)`, which seems to be a C++ function. The prefix `_Z7` suggests it's a mangled name, and `iscuberi` is likely the original function name. The parameter is an `i32`, so an integer.

The function starts by taking the absolute value of the input with `llvm.abs.i32`. That means the function is probably working with the absolute value of the input, so I'll use `abs()` in C++.

Next, there's a loop starting at label 3. The loop uses a PHI node for variable `%4`, initialized to 0. So, I'll have a loop variable starting at 0.

Inside the loop, `%5` is `%4 * %4`, which is `n` squared. `%6` is `%5 * %4`, so `n` cubed. Then, it checks if `%6` is less than `%2` (the absolute value). If true, it increments `%4` by 1 and loops again.

Once the loop exits, it checks if `%6` is less than or equal to `%2` and returns that as a boolean.

Putting this together, the function is checking if the cube of some number `n` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the input. It returns true if such an `n` exists.

So, the C++ function should loop `n` from 0 upwards, calculate `n^3`, and check against the absolute input. If `n^3` exceeds the input, it stops and returns whether `n^3` is still within the limit.

I'll write the C++ function to implement this logic, ensuring it correctly handles the absolute value and the loop condition.

Here's the decompiled C++ source code based on the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // For abs()

bool iscuber(int x) {
    int abs_x = std::abs(x);
    int n = 0;
    while (true) {
        int cube = n * n * n;
        if (cube > abs_x) {
            break;
        }
        ++n;
    }
    return (n * n * n) <= abs_x;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `iscuber` takes an integer `x` and computes its absolute value.
- It initializes `n` to 0 and enters a loop where it calculates `n^3`.
- The loop continues as long as `n^3` is less than or equal to `abs_x`.
- Once `n^3` exceeds `abs_x`, the loop exits.
- The function returns `true` if `n^3` is within the limit, indicating that `x` is a cube number.

This code should replicate the behavior of the provided LLVM IR accurately.
