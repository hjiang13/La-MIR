Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR is doing. 

Looking at the function `_Z9solutionsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, I see it's taking a `std::vector<int>` as an argument. The function starts by getting pointers to the vector's elements. It loads the end pointer and the start pointer, then calculates the distance between them, which gives the size of the vector.

If the size is zero, it returns immediately. Otherwise, it calculates the size divided by two, but rounded up. There's some bit manipulation here, like shifting and masking, to compute this value. 

Next, there's a loop that seems to be processing the vector in chunks of four elements. It's using SIMD instructions to handle four elements at a time. Each iteration loads four elements, checks if they are odd, and sums them up if they are. This continues until all elements are processed.

If the vector size is larger than 14 elements, it uses a loop to handle the remaining elements one by one, checking each for being odd and adding them to the sum.

Putting this together, the function is summing all the odd numbers in the vector. The C++ code should reflect this logic, using loops and conditionals to check each element.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code that corresponds to the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int solutions(vector<int> &v) {
    if (v.empty()) return 0;

    int n = (v.size() + 1) / 2;
    int sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (v[i] % 2 == 1) {
            sum += v[i];
        }
    }

    return sum;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**: The function takes a reference to a `vector<int>` and returns an `int`.

2. **Empty Check**: If the vector is empty, it returns 0 immediately.

3. **Size Calculation**: The size `n` is calculated as half the vector's size, rounded up.

4. **Loop Through Elements**: The loop iterates up to `n` times, checking if each element is odd (using modulo 2). If an element is odd, it's added to the sum.

5. **Return Sum**: Finally, the sum of all odd elements is returned.

This code effectively captures the logic present in the LLVM IR, providing a clear and efficient solution to summing odd numbers in a vector.
