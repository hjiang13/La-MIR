Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C or C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code represents.

Looking at the IR, I see a function named @_Z3addii which takes two i32 arguments and returns an i32. The function adds the two arguments using 'add nsw i32 %1, %0' and returns the result.

The name @_Z3addii suggests it's a C++ function because of the mangling. Let me try to demangle it. The prefix '_Z' indicates a mangled name. '3addii' breaks down as 'add' with two 'i's, meaning two integer arguments. So, the function is likely 'int add(int, int)'.

In the IR, the function starts by adding the two parameters and returning the result. There's no error checking or complex operations, just a simple addition.

I should write a C++ function that matches this behavior. Since the IR is straightforward, the C++ code should be simple as well. I'll define a function 'add' that takes two integers and returns their sum.

I'll also include the necessary function signature and make sure it's a free function, not a member function, as indicated by the IR.

Finally, I'll test the code to ensure it compiles and runs correctly, producing the expected output for given inputs.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Function**: The IR defines a function `_Z3addii` which takes two `i32` (32-bit integer) parameters and returns an `i32`.

2. **Demangle the Function Name**: The name `_Z3addii` is a mangled C++ function name. Demangling it reveals that the function is `add(int, int)`.

3. **Understand the Function Logic**: The function performs an addition of the two input parameters and returns the result.

Based on this analysis, the C++ source code can be written as follows:

```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation**:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `add` is defined to take two `int` parameters, `a` and `b`.

2. **Addition Operation**: Inside the function, the sum of `a` and `b` is computed using the `+` operator.

3. **Return Statement**: The result of the addition is returned as the output of the function.

This C++ code accurately reflects the behavior defined in the provided LLVM IR and can be compiled and executed directly.
