Alright, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C/C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the IR code is doing.

Looking at the function definition, it's a function named `_Z17is_multiply_primei` which takes an `i32` (integer) and returns an `i1` (boolean). This likely corresponds to a function named `is_multiply_prime` in C++. 

The function starts by comparing the input `%0` with 4. If it's less than 4, it branches to label 11, otherwise to label 3. 

In label 11, there's a phi node indicating some loop variables, and it checks if `%12` equals 2. If so, it returns true, else false. This suggests that if the input is less than 4, the function returns whether it's exactly 2, which is the only prime number in that range.

Moving to label 3, there are phi nodes initializing variables for a loop. It calculates the remainder of `%6` divided by `%4` and checks if it's zero and if `%6` is greater than `%4`. If both conditions are true, it branches to label 14; otherwise, to label 23.

In label 14, it calculates the quotient of `%16` divided by `%4`, increments `%15`, checks the remainder again, and loops if conditions are met. This looks like a loop that checks for factors up to the square root of the number.

Label 23 updates the loop variables, increments `%4`, and checks if the square of `%26` exceeds `%24`. If so, it breaks out of the loop; otherwise, it continues. This is typical of a primality test loop.

Putting it all together, the function is checking if the input number is a prime by testing divisibility up to its square root. The function returns true if no divisors are found, indicating it's a prime.

So, the C++ function should handle numbers less than 2 as non-prime, return true for 2, and for larger numbers, check for factors up to the square root, skipping even numbers for efficiency.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the structure and logic of the IR code and map it back to high-level C++ constructs.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_multiply_prime(int n) {
    if (n < 4) {
        return n == 2;
    }

    int d = 2;
    int m = n;
    while (true) {
        int r = m % d;
        if (r == 0 && m > d) {
            return false;
        }
        if (m < d) {
            break;
        }
        m = m / d;
        d++;
        if (d * d > m) {
            break;
        }
    }

    if (m == 1) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    std::cout << std::boolalpha; // Print 'true' or 'false' instead of 1 or 0
    std::cout << is_multiply_prime(2) << std::endl;  // Output: true
    std::cout << is_multiply_prime(4) << std::endl;  // Output: false
    std::cout << is_multiply_prime(7) << std::endl;  // Output: true
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
The decompiled code defines a function `is_multiply_prime` that checks whether a given integer is a prime number. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Initial Check for Small Numbers:**
   - If the input number `n` is less than 4, the function immediately returns `true` only if `n` is 2, as 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.

2. **Loop for Checking Divisors:**
   - The loop starts with `d = 2` and `m = n`.
   - It calculates the remainder `r = m % d`.
   - If `r` is 0 and `m > d`, the number is not prime, so the function returns `false`.
   - If `m` becomes less than `d`, the loop breaks.
   - `m` is divided by `d` (`m = m / d`), and `d` is incremented (`d++`).
   - If `d * d` exceeds `m`, the loop breaks to avoid unnecessary calculations.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, if `m` is 1, the original number is not prime.
   - Otherwise, the number is prime, and the function returns `true`.

The `main` function provides example usage of `is_multiply_prime`, demonstrating how to check for prime numbers and print the results.

This decompiled code accurately reflects the logic and structure of the original LLVM IR code, providing a clear and efficient prime-checking function in C++.
