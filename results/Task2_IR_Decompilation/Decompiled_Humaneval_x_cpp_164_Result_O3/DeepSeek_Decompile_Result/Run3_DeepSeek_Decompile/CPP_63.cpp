Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by looking at the IR code provided.

The function is named @_Z6fibfibi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, this would translate to something like fib(int). So it's a function that takes an integer and returns an integer.

Looking at the IR, it starts by allocating a block of memory for an array of 100 integers. That's done with the alloca instruction. Then there are several store instructions initializing the first few elements of this array. It looks like the array is being used to store Fibonacci numbers.

There's a conditional check (icmp slt i32 %0, 3) which probably handles base cases for small values of the input. If the input is less than 3, it goes to label 31, which loads the value from the array and returns it.

For larger values, the code enters a loop. There are two main loops, one starting at label 8 and another at label 35. It seems like the code is using an iterative approach to compute Fibonacci numbers, storing each result in the array.

I notice that there are two separate loops: one for even indices and one for odd indices. This might be an optimization to compute two Fibonacci numbers in each iteration, which is a common technique to improve performance.

The loops use getelementptr to access the array elements and store the computed values. Each loop updates the indices and checks whether they've reached the target value.

After computing up to the required index, the function loads the result from the array and returns it. The array is probably being used to avoid recomputation and to store intermediate values.

Putting this together, the C++ function would take an integer n, initialize an array of size 100, set the base cases, and then use a loop to compute each Fibonacci number up to n. The final result is then returned from the array.

I should make sure to handle cases where n is less than the array size, and also ensure that the array is properly managed. Since the array is declared inside the function, it's automatically managed, so no dynamic memory allocation is needed.

Wait, the array size is 100, but what if n is larger than 99? In that case, the function might not work correctly. But looking at the IR, it doesn't seem to handle that, so I'll assume that n is within the array bounds.

So, the decompiled code should have an array of 100 integers, initialize the first few, then iterate up to n, computing each Fibonacci number and storing it in the array. Finally, return the nth Fibonacci number.

I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to use the same base cases and loop structure as the IR. I'll also include the necessary includes and function signature.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into a C++ source code, we can analyze the IR and map it back to high-level C++ constructs. The IR code appears to implement a Fibonacci function using an iterative approach with optimizations. Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>

int fib(int n) {
    int fib_array[100];
    fib_array[0] = 0;
    fib_array[1] = 0;
    fib_array[2] = 1;

    if (n < 3) {
        return fib_array[n];
    }

    fib_array[3] = 1;
    int i = 4;
    while (i <= n) {
        fib_array[i] = fib_array[i-1] + fib_array[i-2];
        i++;
    }

    return fib_array[n];
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `fib` takes an integer `n` and returns an integer.

2. **Array Initialization**: An array `fib_array` of size 100 is declared to store Fibonacci numbers up to the 100th position.

3. **Base Cases**: The first few Fibonacci numbers are initialized directly in the array.

4. **Early Return for Small Values**: If `n` is less than 3, the function immediately returns the precomputed value from the array.

5. **Iterative Calculation**: For values of `n` greater than or equal to 3, the function iterates from 4 up to `n`, computing each Fibonacci number and storing it in the array.

6. **Return Result**: The function returns the nth Fibonacci number from the array.

This decompiled code should work for values of `n` up to 99, as the array is sized to accommodate 100 elements (indices 0 to 99). For larger values of `n`, you would need to increase the array size or implement dynamic memory allocation.
