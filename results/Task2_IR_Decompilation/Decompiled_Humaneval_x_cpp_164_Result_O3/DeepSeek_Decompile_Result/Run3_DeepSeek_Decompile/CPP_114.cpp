Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by looking at the IR code provided. 

The function is called _Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE, which I think is the mangled name for minSubArraySum, taking a std::vector<long long> as an argument. So the function signature in C++ should be something like long long minSubArraySum(const std::vector<long long>&).

Looking at the IR, the function starts by getting the elements of the vector. It loads the data pointer (%3), the start (%4), and the end (%6) of the vector. It calculates the length by subtracting the start pointer from the end pointer, then shifting right by 3, which suggests it's converting bytes to elements since each element is 8 bytes (long long). So, %10 is the length divided by 8, but I'm not sure why it's being compared with 1. Maybe if the length is less than 16 bytes (2 elements), it handles it differently.

The first condition checks if the length is greater than 1. If not, it goes to label 32, which returns %4, the first element. If it is, it proceeds to check if the length is exactly 16 bytes (2 elements). If so, it goes to label 18; otherwise, it goes to label 16.

In label 18, it initializes some variables. %19, %20, %21, %22 are phi nodes, which means their values depend on where they're coming from. It looks like %21 and %22 are initializing to %4, the first element. %20 is starting at 1. Then it checks if %14 is zero. %14 is from %13, which is %10 -1, and then ANDed with 1, so it's checking if the length minus 1 is odd. If it is zero, meaning even, it goes to label 32, else to 24.

In label 24, it checks if %22 is less than zero. If so, it uses %22; else, 0. Then it adds the current element to this value. It compares this sum to %21 and keeps the smaller one as the current minimum. Then it goes back to label 32.

If the initial condition was that the length was more than 1, and not exactly 2 elements, it goes to label 16. There, it sets %17 to %13 AND -2, which seems to be handling even lengths. Then it jumps to label 34.

Label 34 is a loop. It increments the index, loads the current element, and checks if the current sum is less than the current minimum. It keeps updating the minimum and the current sum until it either finds a new minimum or completes the loop.

Looking at the phi nodes and the way variables are updated, it seems the function is implementing Kadane's algorithm to find the minimum subarray sum. It handles edge cases for small arrays and then iterates through the array, keeping track of the current sum and the minimum found.

Putting it all together, the C++ code should handle these cases: if the array is empty, return 0; if it has one element, return that element; if it has two, handle accordingly. Then, iterate through the array, updating the current sum and minimum as it goes.

I think I've got a good grasp of how the IR translates to C++. Now, I'll write the source code accordingly.

The given LLVM IR code is for a function that computes the minimum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm. Here's the decompiled C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

long long minSubArraySum(const vector<long long>& arr) {
    if (arr.empty()) {
        return 0; // Assuming 0 for empty array, adjust if needed
    }

    long long min_sum = arr[0];
    long long current_sum = arr[0];
    
    for (size_t i = 1; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        current_sum = min(arr[i], current_sum + arr[i]);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_sum);
    }

    return min_sum;
}
```

This code efficiently finds the minimum contiguous subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm, iterating through the array while maintaining the current and minimum sums.
