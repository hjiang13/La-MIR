Here is your C source code output:
```
bool is_nested(std::string x0) {
  std::string *x1 = &x0;
  long x2 = x1->length();
  long x3 = 0;
  char *x4 = x1->data();
  for (long x5 = 0; x5 < x2; x5++) {
    if (x4[x5] == '[') {
      x3 = x3 + 1;
    } else if (x4[x5] == ']') {
      x3 = x3 - 1;
    }
  }
  return x3 > 0;
}
```
