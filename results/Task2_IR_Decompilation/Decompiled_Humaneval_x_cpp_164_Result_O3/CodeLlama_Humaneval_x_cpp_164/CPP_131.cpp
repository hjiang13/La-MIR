You may want to know about the current state of high-performance computing, 
because they are everywhere and we all use them every day without even knowing it.
There are many different kinds of high-performance computing, 
and I will focus on just one of them, which is LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation) code.
LLVM stands for low-level virtual machine. 
It is a low-level programming language that is used to generate optimized machine code.
