assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion `assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to sum all numbers from 1 to n. the formula used is `n*(n+1)/2`. i remember that this is the standard formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. so for n=1, the sum should be 1.

let me compute what the function returns when n is 1. plugging in 1 into the formula: 1*(1+1)/2 = (1*2)/2 = 2/2 = 1. so the function should return 1 when given 1 as input.

now, the assertion checks if `sum_to_n(1)` equals 1. since the function correctly returns 1, the condition in the assert should evaluate to true. therefore, the assertion should pass.

i don't see any issues with the code. the formula is correct, and the calculation for n=1 is accurate. so the assertion won't trigger any failure; it will pass without any problems.

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. for `n=1`, this results in 1, which matches the assertion condition.

assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the assertion sum_to_n(6) == 21 passes or fails. let me start by understanding what the function sum_to_n does. from the code, it's supposed to sum numbers from 1 to n. 

looking at the code, the function uses the formula n*(n+1)/2. that makes sense because the sum of the first n natural numbers is a well-known formula. so for example, when n is 5, the sum is 15, which matches the sample given.

now, the assertion is checking when n is 6. let me calculate that manually. the sum from 1 to 6 is 1+2+3+4+5+6. let's add them up: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15, plus 6 is 21. so the expected result is 21.

using the formula, n is 6. plugging into the formula: 6*(6+1)/2. that's 6*7=42, divided by 2 is 21. so the function should return 21 when given 6.

therefore, the assertion sum_to_n(6) == 21 should pass because both the manual calculation and the formula give the same result.
</think>

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first 6 natural numbers using the formula, resulting in 21. thus, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the assertion sum_to_n(11) == 66 passes or fails. let's start by understanding what the function sum_to_n does. 

from the code provided, the function is supposed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. the formula used is n*(n+1)/2. i remember that this is the standard formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. so, for example, when n is 5, the sum is 1+2+3+4+5=15, which matches the sample given.

now, the assertion is checking if sum_to_n(11) equals 66. let me compute this manually. using the formula, 11*(11+1)/2. that's 11*12=132, divided by 2 is 66. so according to the formula, the result should be 66.

wait, but i should also check if the code correctly implements this formula. looking at the function, it's written as return n*(n+1)/2; which is correct. so when n is 11, the function should return 66.

i don't see any issues here. the function is correctly using integer arithmetic, but since 11 and 12 are both even and odd, their product is even, so dividing by 2 should result in an integer without any loss. so the calculation should be accurate.

therefore, the assertion should pass because sum_to_n(11) indeed equals 66.
</think>

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. for `n=11`, the calculation is `11*12/2 = 66`, which matches the assertion.

assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion `assert(sum_to_n(30) == 465);` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to sum numbers from 1 to n. the formula used is `n*(n+1)/2`. that makes sense because the sum of the first n natural numbers is a well-known formula, which is n(n+1)/2. so, the function should correctly compute this sum.

now, the assertion is checking if `sum_to_n(30)` equals 465. let me compute this manually to verify. 

calculating 30*(30+1)/2: 30*31 is 930, and dividing by 2 gives 465. so, the expected result is indeed 465.

i should also check if there are any potential issues with the code. the function uses integer division, but since the formula n(n+1)/2 always results in an integer when n is an integer, there shouldn't be any loss of precision here. for example, when n is even, n/2 is an integer, and when n is odd, (n+1) is even, so (n+1)/2 is an integer. so, the division by 2 won't cause any floating-point errors.

another thing to consider is the data type. the function returns an `int`, and for n=30, the result is 465, which is well within the range of a 32-bit integer. so, there's no overflow issue here.

i can also look at the examples provided in the comments. for instance, `sum_to_n(5)` should return 15, which it does because 5*6/2 is 15. similarly, `sum_to_n(10)` gives 55, which is correct. these examples suggest that the function works as intended.

therefore, when the assertion is run, `sum_to_n(30)` will return 465, which matches the expected value. so, the assertion should pass without any issues.

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. for `n=30`, the result is 465, which matches the assertion.

assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion `assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. the formula used is `n*(n+1)/2`. i remember that this is the standard formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. so for n=100, the sum should be 100*101/2.

let me compute that manually. 100 multiplied by 101 is 10100. dividing that by 2 gives 5050. so the expected result is 5050.

now, looking at the function implementation: it's a straightforward return statement using the formula. so when n is 100, the function should return 5050.

the assertion checks if `sum_to_n(100)` equals 5050. since the function correctly computes this, the assertion should pass.

i don't see any issues with integer overflow here because 100 is a small number, and the result is within the range of a 32-bit integer. so there shouldn't be any calculation errors.

therefore, the assertion should pass without any problems.
</think>

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first 100 natural numbers using the formula, resulting in 5050. the assertion checks for this value and will pass.
