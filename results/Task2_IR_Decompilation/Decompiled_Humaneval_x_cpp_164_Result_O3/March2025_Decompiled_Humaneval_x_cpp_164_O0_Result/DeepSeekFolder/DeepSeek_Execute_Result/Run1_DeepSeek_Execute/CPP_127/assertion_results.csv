"assert (intersection({1, 2}, {2, 3}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's start by understanding the problem.

the function `intersection` takes two intervals, each represented as a vector of two integers. each interval is a pair (start, end), and it's closed, meaning both endpoints are included. the task is to find the length of their intersection and check if it's a prime number. if it is, return ""yes""; otherwise, ""no"". if there's no intersection, return ""no"".

looking at the code, the function calculates the intersection's start as the maximum of the two intervals' starts and the end as the minimum of the two intervals' ends. then, it computes the length `l` as `inter2 - inter1`. 

if `l` is less than 2, it returns ""no"" immediately because prime numbers are greater than 1. otherwise, it checks for factors of `l` starting from 2 up to the square root of `l`. if any divisor is found, it returns ""no""; if none are found, it returns ""yes"".

now, the assertion is `assert(intersection({1, 2}, {2, 3}) == ""no"")`. let's compute this step by step.

first, find the intersection of (1,2) and (2,3). the start of the intersection is max(1,2) = 2. the end is min(2,3) = 2. so the intersection is (2,2), which has a length of 0 (since 2-2=0). 

in the code, `l` is 0, which is less than 2. so the function returns ""no"". the assertion expects ""no"", so it should pass.

wait, but wait a minute. the length is 0, which is not a prime. so the function correctly returns ""no"". so the assertion is correct.

but let me think again. the code computes `l = inter2 - inter1`. in this case, inter1 is 2, inter2 is 2, so l is 0. since 0 < 2, it returns ""no"". so yes, the function returns ""no"" as expected by the assertion.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly computes the intersection length as 0, which is less than 2, so it returns ""no"". the assertion expects ""no"", so it passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({-1, 1}, {0, 4}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. the assertion is checking if the function intersection returns ""no"" when given the intervals {-1, 1} and {0, 4}.

let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. the function takes two intervals, each represented as a vector of two integers. it calculates the intersection of these intervals and checks if the length of this intersection is a prime number. if it is, it returns ""yes""; otherwise, it returns ""no"". also, if the intervals don't intersect, it returns ""no"".

so, the first step is to find the intersection of the two intervals. the intersection is the overlapping part. to find this, i need to determine the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points of the two intervals.

looking at the code, the variables inter1 and inter2 are calculated as the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points, respectively. then, the length l is inter2 minus inter1. if l is less than 2, the function returns ""no"" immediately because a prime number must be 2 or larger.

wait, but wait. the problem says that the length is the number of integers included in the intersection. for example, the interval (2,3) has a length of 2 (since it includes 2 and 3). so, the length is calculated as (end - start + 1) if the interval is inclusive. but in the code, l is calculated as inter2 - inter1. hmm, that might be a mistake.

wait, let me think again. for example, if the interval is (1,3), the length is 3-1+1 = 3. but in the code, l is 3-1=2, which would be incorrect. so the code might have a bug here.

but wait, looking back at the example given in the problem statement: the intersection of (1,3) and (2,4) is (2,3), which has a length of 2 (since 3-2+1=2). but in the code, l is 3-2=1. so according to the code, the length is 1, which is correct because the example says the length is 1. wait, no, the example says the length is 1, which is correct. so perhaps the code is correct in calculating l as inter2 - inter1.

wait, no. let me clarify: the length of the interval (a, b) is b - a + 1. so for (2,3), it's 3-2+1=2. but in the example, the code's l is 3-2=1, which is wrong. so the code is miscalculating the length.

wait, but in the problem statement, the example says that the intersection is (2,3) and the length is 1, which is not a prime. but according to the correct calculation, the length should be 2, which is a prime. so that would change the result.

hmm, this suggests that the code might have a bug in how it calculates the length. because in the example, the code returns ""no"" because l is 1, but the actual length is 2, which is a prime, so the correct return should be ""yes"".

wait, but the problem statement's example says that the function returns ""no"" for that case. so perhaps the code is correct as per the problem statement, but the way the length is calculated is different.

wait, maybe i'm misunderstanding the problem. let me re-read the problem statement.

the problem says: the length of the intersection is the number of integers in the interval. so for (2,3), the integers are 2 and 3, so the length is 2. so the code's calculation of l as inter2 - inter1 would give 1, which is incorrect.

so the code is wrong in how it calculates the length. it should be l = inter2 - inter1 + 1. because the length is the count of integers from inter1 to inter2, inclusive.

so in the code, when inter1 is 2 and inter2 is 3, l is 1, but the actual length is 2.

this is a critical mistake because it affects the result of the function.

now, let's go back to the assertion we're supposed to check: intersection({-1, 1}, {0, 4}) should return ""no"".

let's compute the intersection of these two intervals.

interval1 is (-1, 1), interval2 is (0,4).

the start of the intersection is the maximum of -1 and 0, which is 0.

the end of the intersection is the minimum of 1 and 4, which is 1.

so the intersection is (0,1). the length is 1 - 0 + 1 = 2.

wait, but according to the code, l is 1 - 0 = 1.

so the code would compute l as 1.

then, the code checks if l < 2. since 1 < 2, it returns ""no"".

so according to the code, the function returns ""no"" for this case, which matches the assertion.

but wait, the actual length is 2, which is a prime number. so the correct result should be ""yes"", but the code returns ""no"" because it's miscalculating the length.

wait, that's a problem. so the code is incorrect, but the assertion is expecting ""no"", which is what the code returns. so the assertion would pass, but the code is wrong.

wait, but the assertion is correct according to the problem statement. or is it?

wait, the problem statement's sample input includes:

intersection({-1, 1}, {0, 4}) ==> ""no""

so according to the problem statement, the correct output is ""no"".

but according to the correct calculation, the length is 2, which is a prime, so the correct output should be ""yes"".

so there's a discrepancy here. so perhaps the problem statement's sample is wrong, or perhaps i'm misunderstanding the problem.

wait, let me re-examine the problem statement.

wait, the problem says that the intervals are closed, meaning that the interval includes both start and end. so the length is the number of integers in the interval, which is end - start + 1.

so for the sample input {-1,1} and {0,4}, the intersection is from 0 to 1, which includes 0 and 1. so the length is 2, which is a prime. so the function should return ""yes"", but according to the sample, it returns ""no"".

hmm, that suggests that the sample is incorrect, or perhaps i'm misunderstanding the problem.

alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the length as the number of units, not the count of integers. for example, the interval (0,1) could be considered as having a length of 1 unit, which is not a prime. so in that case, the function would return ""no"".

wait, but the problem statement says that the length is the number of integers in the interval. so for (0,1), it's 2 integers, which is a prime.

so the sample in the problem statement seems to be incorrect.

but regardless, the code provided is using l = inter2 - inter1, which for the case of (0,1) gives l=1. so the code returns ""no"" because 1 is less than 2.

so in the assertion, the function returns ""no"" as expected, so the assertion passes.

but according to the correct calculation, the function should return ""yes"", but the code is incorrect.

so the assertion is passing because the code is wrong, but the sample expects ""no"".

wait, but the problem statement's sample says that the function returns ""no"" for that case, which aligns with the code's incorrect calculation.

so the code is incorrect, but the assertion is correct as per the code's behavior.

so the assertion is checking whether the code returns ""no"" for that input, which it does, so the assertion passes.

so the final result is that the assertion passes.

but wait, perhaps i should re-examine the code more carefully.

looking at the code:

inter1 is max(interval1[0], interval2[0]) → max(-1,0) is 0.

inter2 is min(interval1[1], interval2[1]) → min(1,4) is 1.

l is inter2 - inter1 → 1-0=1.

since 1 < 2, return ""no"".

so the function returns ""no"" for this case, which matches the assertion.

therefore, the assertion passes.

but wait, the correct length is 2, which is a prime, so the function should return ""yes"". so the code is incorrect, but the assertion is correct according to the code's behavior.

so the assertion passes.

so the final result is that the assertion passes.
</think>

the function calculates the intersection's length as `inter2 - inter1`, which is incorrect. for the given intervals, the intersection is (0,1), length 2. however, the code computes length 1, leading it to return ""no"". the assertion expects ""no"", so it passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({-3, -1}, {-5, 5}) == ""YES"");",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's break this down step by step.

first, i'll look at the function `intersection` which takes two intervals as vectors. each interval is a pair of integers, like (start, end). the function's goal is to check if the length of their intersection is a prime number. if it is, return ""yes""; otherwise, ""no"". also, if there's no intersection, return ""no"".

the assertion given is `intersection({-3, -1}, {-5, 5}) == ""yes""`. so i need to see what the function returns for these intervals.

let's compute the intersection of the two intervals. the first interval is from -3 to -1, and the second is from -5 to 5. the intersection starts at the maximum of the two starts and ends at the minimum of the two ends.

calculating the start of the intersection: max(-3, -5) is -3.
calculating the end of the intersection: min(-1, 5) is -1.
so the intersection is from -3 to -1.

the length of this intersection is end - start + 1? wait, wait. wait, no. wait, the problem says the interval is closed, so the length is (end - start) + 1? or is it just end - start?

wait, in the example given in the problem statement: the intersection of (1,3) and (2,4) is (2,3), which has a length of 1. because 3-2 is 1. so the length is calculated as end - start. so in that case, the length is 1.

so in our case, the intersection is from -3 to -1. so the length is (-1) - (-3) = 2.

now, the function checks if this length is a prime number. so 2 is a prime number, right? yes, because it's only divisible by 1 and itself.

so the function should return ""yes"" for this case.

looking at the code:

the function calculates `inter1` as the max of the two starts, `inter2` as the min of the two ends. then `l` is `inter2 - inter1`. if `l < 2`, it returns ""no"". otherwise, it checks if `l` is a prime.

wait, wait. wait, in the code, `l` is inter2 - inter1. so in our case, inter2 is -1, inter1 is -3. so l is (-1) - (-3) = 2.

then, the code checks if l < 2. since 2 is not less than 2, it proceeds. then it loops from i=2 to sqrt(l), which is sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so the loop doesn't run. so it returns ""yes"".

so the function returns ""yes"" for the given assertion, which matches the expected result.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly calculates the intersection length as 2, which is a prime number, so it returns ""yes"". the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({-2, 2}, {-4, 0}) == ""YES"");",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's break it down step by step.

first, let's understand what the function is supposed to do. the function takes two intervals, each represented as a vector with two integers. each interval is a pair (start, end), and it's closed, meaning both endpoints are included. the task is to determine if the length of the intersection of these two intervals is a prime number. if it is, return ""yes""; otherwise, return ""no"". also, if the intervals don't intersect, return ""no"".

looking at the code, the function starts by calculating the intersection. it finds the maximum of the two starts (inter1) and the minimum of the two ends (inter2). the length of the intersection is then l = inter2 - inter1. 

wait, but wait. if inter2 is less than inter1, then l would be negative. but in the code, they compute l as inter2 - inter1, and then check if l < 2. so if the intervals don't overlap, l would be negative, which is less than 2, so the function returns ""no"". that makes sense.

now, the assertion given is intersection({-2, 2}, {-4, 0}) == ""yes"". let's compute the intersection of these two intervals.

the first interval is from -2 to 2, and the second is from -4 to 0. the maximum of the starts is max(-2, -4) which is -2. the minimum of the ends is min(2, 0) which is 0. so the intersection is from -2 to 0. the length is 0 - (-2) = 2.

so l is 2. now, the code checks if l < 2. since 2 is not less than 2, it proceeds. then it checks if 2 is a prime number.

wait, what's the code doing? it initializes i to 2, and loops while i*i <= l. for l=2, i starts at 2. 2*2 is 4, which is greater than 2, so the loop doesn't run. therefore, the function returns ""yes"".

but wait, is 2 a prime number? yes, 2 is a prime. so the function correctly returns ""yes"".

so the assertion expects ""yes"", which is what the function returns. therefore, the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me double-check the code. let me see:

in the code, after computing l, if l < 2, return ""no"". else, check for factors. so for l=2, it's not less than 2, so proceed. then, for i starting at 2, i*i is 4, which is greater than 2, so the loop doesn't execute. so it returns ""yes"".

yes, that's correct. so the assertion should pass.

i think that's the case. so the final result is that the assertion passes.
</think>

the function correctly calculates the intersection length as 2, which is a prime number, so the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({-11, 2}, {-1, -1}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. the function in question is called 'intersection' and it's supposed to check if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number. if it is, it returns ""yes""; otherwise, ""no"". also, if the intervals don't intersect, it returns ""no"".

let me first understand the code step by step.

the function takes two vectors, interval1 and interval2. each vector has two integers representing the start and end of an interval, inclusive. the code calculates the intersection of these two intervals.

so, the steps are:

1. calculate the start of the intersection (inter1) as the maximum of the two interval starts. because the intersection can't start before either of the intervals.
2. calculate the end of the intersection (inter2) as the minimum of the two interval ends. because the intersection can't extend beyond the shorter end.
3. compute the length (l) as inter2 - inter1.
4. if the length is less than 2, return ""no"" immediately. because prime numbers are greater than 1, so a length of 0 or 1 can't be prime.
5. otherwise, check if 'l' is a prime. it does this by checking divisibility from 2 up to sqrt(l). if any divisor is found, it's not prime, so return ""no"".
6. if no divisors are found, return ""yes"".

now, looking at the assertion: intersection({-11, 2}, {-1, -1}) should return ""no"".

let's compute the intersection of these two intervals.

interval1 is from -11 to 2. interval2 is from -1 to -1. so, the second interval is just a single point at -1.

the intersection's start is the max of -11 and -1, which is -1. the end is the min of 2 and -1, which is -1. so the intersection is from -1 to -1, which is a single point. the length is (-1) - (-1) = 0.

in the code, l is 0, which is less than 2. so the function returns ""no"".

so the assertion expects ""no"", which is exactly what the function returns. therefore, the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me double-check. the function returns ""no"" when the length is less than 2. since 0 is less than 2, it returns ""no"". so yes, the assertion is correct.

i think that's all. so the assertion passes.
</think>

the assertion passes because the intersection length is 0, which is less than 2, so the function correctly returns ""no"".

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({1, 2}, {3, 5}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's break this down step by step.

first, let's understand what the function is supposed to do. the function 'intersection' takes two intervals, each represented as a vector of two integers. the goal is to find the length of their intersection and check if that length is a prime number. if it is, return ""yes""; otherwise, return ""no"". also, if the intervals don't intersect, return ""no"".

looking at the code, the function calculates the intersection's start as the maximum of the two intervals' starts (inter1) and the end as the minimum of the two intervals' ends (inter2). the length is then inter2 - inter1. if this length is less than 2, it returns ""no"" because prime numbers are greater than 1. then, it checks for factors from 2 up to the square root of the length. if any factor is found, it's not a prime, so return ""no"". otherwise, return ""yes"".

now, the assertion given is: intersection({1, 2}, {3, 5}) should return ""no"". let's see why.

the first interval is (1,2), the second is (3,5). to find their intersection, we compute inter1 as max(1,3) = 3, and inter2 as min(2,5) = 2. so the intersection is (3,2), which doesn't make sense because the start is greater than the end. this means there's no overlap between the intervals.

in the code, the length l is calculated as inter2 - inter1, which is 2 - 3 = -1. but since l is negative, the condition l < 2 is true, so the function returns ""no"". 

wait, but in the code, l is inter2 - inter1. so if inter2 < inter1, l would be negative. but in the code, the first check is if (l < 2) return ""no"". so for l being negative, it's definitely less than 2, so it returns ""no"".

so in the assertion case, the function correctly returns ""no"" because the intervals don't intersect. therefore, the assertion should pass.

i think that's correct. so the assertion expects ""no"", and the function returns ""no"", so the assertion passes.
</think>

the function correctly returns ""no"" for non-overlapping intervals, so the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({1, 2}, {1, 2}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding the problem and the code.

the task is to determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number. if it is, return ""yes""; otherwise, return ""no"". if there's no intersection, return ""no"" as well.

looking at the code, the function 'intersection' takes two vectors, each representing an interval. it calculates the intersection's start and end points. the start of the intersection is the maximum of the two intervals' starts, and the end is the minimum of the two intervals' ends. then, it calculates the length as end minus start.

wait, but in the code, the variables are named inter1 and inter2. so inter1 is the max of the starts, inter2 is the min of the ends. then l is inter2 - inter1. but wait, if the intervals don't overlap, inter2 could be less than inter1, making l negative. but in the code, l is just calculated as inter2 - inter1. so if the intervals don't intersect, l would be negative, right?

but in the code, the first check is if (l < 2) return ""no"". so if l is less than 2, including negative numbers, it returns ""no"". that makes sense because a prime number is greater than 1, so if the length is less than 2, it can't be prime.

so the code proceeds to check if l is a prime. it does this by checking divisibility from 2 up to sqrt(l). if any divisor is found, it returns ""no""; otherwise, it returns ""yes"".

now, looking at the assertion: intersection({1,2}, {1,2}) should return ""no"". let's see why.

the two intervals are (1,2) and (1,2). the intersection is from max(1,1)=1 to min(2,2)=2. so the length is 2-1=1. wait, no, wait: 2-1 is 1. so l is 1.

in the code, the first condition is if (l < 2) return ""no"". since 1 is less than 2, it returns ""no"". so the assertion expects ""no"", which is correct.

but wait, wait a second. let me double-check. the interval (1,2) includes both 1 and 2. so the length is 2-1 +1? or is it just the difference? because in the example given in the problem statement, the intersection of (1,3) and (2,4) is (2,3), which has a length of 1. so the code calculates it as 3-2=1, which is correct. so in the case of (1,2) and (1,2), the length is 2-1=1, which is correct.

so the code returns ""no"" because 1 is less than 2. so the assertion is correct.

wait, but wait another thing. the function returns ""no"" when the length is less than 2. so in the case where the length is exactly 2, it would proceed to check if 2 is a prime. since 2 is a prime, it would return ""yes"".

so for the assertion, the length is 1, so it returns ""no"", which matches the assertion.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the assertion checks if the intersection of two identical intervals (1,2) returns ""no"". the intersection length is 1, which is less than 2, so the function correctly returns ""no"".

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({-2, -2}, {-3, -2}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. the function in question is called intersection, and it's supposed to determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number. if it is, it returns ""yes""; otherwise, ""no"". also, if the intervals don't intersect, it returns ""no"".

the assertion given is: intersection({-2, -2}, {-3, -2}) == ""no"". i need to see what the function returns for these intervals.

first, let's understand the intervals. interval1 is (-2, -2), which is a single point. interval2 is (-3, -2), which is from -3 to -2, including both endpoints. so the intersection of these two intervals would be the overlapping part.

to find the intersection, the code calculates inter1 as the maximum of the starts and inter2 as the minimum of the ends. so for interval1[0] = -2 and interval2[0] = -3, the max is -2. for the ends, interval1[1] is -2 and interval2[1] is -2, so the min is -2. so inter1 is -2, inter2 is -2. the length l is inter2 - inter1, which is 0.

wait, wait. wait a minute. because the intervals are closed, so the intersection is from -2 to -2, which is a single point. so the length is 0. but in the code, l is calculated as inter2 - inter1, which is 0. then the code checks if l < 2. since 0 is less than 2, it returns ""no"".

so the function returns ""no"" for this case. the assertion expects ""no"", so the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me double-check. the function's logic is: compute the intersection's start and end. then calculate the length. if the length is less than 2, return ""no"". because primes are numbers greater than 1. so any length less than 2 can't be a prime, so it's ""no"".

in this case, the length is 0, which is less than 2. so the function returns ""no"", which matches the assertion. so the assertion should pass.

but wait, what if the intervals don't intersect? like, if inter1 > inter2, then the intersection is empty. but in this case, inter1 is -2 and inter2 is -2, so the intersection is a single point. so the length is 0, which is handled correctly.

so the function correctly returns ""no"" for this case, so the assertion is correct and should pass.
</think>

the function correctly returns ""no"" for the given intervals because the intersection length is 0, which is less than 2 and thus not a prime. the assertion expects ""no"", so it passes.
