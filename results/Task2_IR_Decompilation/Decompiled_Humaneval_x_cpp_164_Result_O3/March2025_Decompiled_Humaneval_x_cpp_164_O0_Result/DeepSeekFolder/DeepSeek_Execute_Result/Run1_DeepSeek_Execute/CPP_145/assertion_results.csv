okay, i need to determine whether the provided c++ function correctly sorts the vector according to the sum of the digits of each integer. the assertion given is that order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) should return {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}. let me break this down step by step.

first, i'll look at the function. it starts by calculating the sum of the digits for each number in the input vector. the sum is stored in sumdigit. then, it sorts the numbers based on these sums, using a bubble sort approach. if two numbers have the same sum, their order is determined by their original indices.

let me compute the sum for each number in the test case:

1. for 1: the absolute value is 1. sum is 1. since it's positive, add 1. so sum is 1.
2. for 11: absolute is 11. sum is 1 + 1 = 2. positive, so add 1 and 1: sum is 2.
3. for -1: absolute is 1. sum is 1. since it's negative, subtract 1. so sum is 0.
4. for -11: absolute is 11. sum is 1 + 1 = 2. since negative, subtract 2. sum is -2.
5. for -12: absolute is 12. sum is 1 + 2 = 3. negative, subtract 3. sum is -3.

wait, wait. let me double-check the sum calculation. the code converts the absolute value to a string, then for each character after the first, adds (char - 48) to sum. then, if the original number is positive, it adds the first digit; if negative, subtracts it.

so for each number:

- 1: positive. string is ""1"". sum is 1 (from first digit). no other digits. so sum is 1.
- 11: positive. string is ""11"". sum is 1 (first digit) + 1 (second digit) = 2.
- -1: negative. string is ""1"". sum is 1 (from first digit), but since negative, subtract it. so sum is -1.
- -11: negative. string is ""11"". sum is 1 (first digit) + 1 (second) = 2. subtract because negative: sum is -2.
- -12: negative. string is ""12"". sum is 1 (first) + 2 (second) = 3. subtract: sum is -3.

so the sumdigit array is [1, 2, -1, -2, -3].

now, the function sorts the nums vector based on sumdigit. the sorting is done using a bubble sort approach. let's see how the sorting proceeds.

the initial nums vector is [1, 11, -1, -11, -12], and sumdigit is [1, 2, -1, -2, -3].

the outer loop runs for i from 0 to nums.size()-1, which is 4. the inner loop j runs from 1 to nums.size()-1, which is 4 as well.

let's walk through each pass of the outer loop.

first pass (i=0):

j starts at 1.

compare sumdigit[0] (1) and sumdigit[1] (2). since 1 < 2, no swap.

j=2: sumdigit[1] is 2, sumdigit[2] is -1. 2 > -1, so swap.

after swap, sumdigit becomes [1, -1, 2, -2, -3]. nums becomes [1, -1, 11, -11, -12].

j=3: sumdigit[2] is 2, sumdigit[3] is -2. 2 > -2, swap.

sumdigit becomes [1, -1, -2, 2, -3]. nums becomes [1, -1, -11, 11, -12].

j=4: sumdigit[3] is 2, sumdigit[4] is -3. 2 > -3, swap.

sumdigit becomes [1, -1, -2, -3, 2]. nums becomes [1, -1, -11, -12, 11].

so after the first pass, the sumdigit is [1, -1, -2, -3, 2], and nums is [1, -1, -11, -12, 11].

second pass (i=1):

j starts at 1.

compare sumdigit[0] (1) and sumdigit[1] (-1). 1 > -1, swap.

sumdigit becomes [-1, 1, -2, -3, 2]. nums becomes [-1, 1, -11, -12, 11].

j=2: sumdigit[1] is 1, sumdigit[2] is -2. 1 > -2, swap.

sumdigit becomes [-1, -2, 1, -3, 2]. nums becomes [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11].

j=3: sumdigit[2] is 1, sumdigit[3] is -3. 1 > -3, swap.

sumdigit becomes [-1, -2, -3, 1, 2]. nums becomes [-1, -11, -12, 1, 11].

j=4: sumdigit[3] is 1, sumdigit[4] is 2. 1 < 2, no swap.

third pass (i=2):

j=1: sumdigit[0] (-1) and sumdigit[1] (-2). -1 > -2, swap.

sumdigit becomes [-2, -1, -3, 1, 2]. nums becomes [-11, -1, -12, 1, 11].

j=2: sumdigit[1] (-1) and sumdigit[2] (-3). -1 > -3, swap.

sumdigit becomes [-2, -3, -1, 1, 2]. nums becomes [-11, -12, -1, 1, 11].

j=3: sumdigit[2] (-1) and sumdigit[3] (1). -1 < 1, no swap.

j=4: sumdigit[3] (1) and sumdigit[4] (2). 1 < 2, no swap.

fourth pass (i=3):

j=1: sumdigit[0] (-2) and sumdigit[1] (-3). -2 > -3, swap.

sumdigit becomes [-3, -2, -1, 1, 2]. nums becomes [-12, -11, -1, 1, 11].

j=2: sumdigit[1] (-2) and sumdigit[2] (-1). -2 > -1, swap.

sumdigit becomes [-3, -1, -2, 1, 2]. nums becomes [-12, -1, -11, 1, 11].

j=3: sumdigit[2] (-2) and sumdigit[3] (1). -2 < 1, no swap.

j=4: sumdigit[3] (1) and sumdigit[4] (2). 1 < 2, no swap.

after this, the outer loop ends.

so the final nums vector is [-12, -1, -11, 1, 11]. wait, but the expected result is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

hmm, that's different. so according to this, the function returns [-12, -1, -11, 1, 11], but the expected is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, but let me check the sumdigit again. because in the sumdigit array after all passes, the order is [-3, -1, -2, 1, 2], which corresponds to the nums [-12, -1, -11, 1, 11].

but the expected order is based on the sum of digits. let's see:

the sum for each number in the test case is:

1: sum is 1.

11: sum is 2.

-1: sum is -1.

-11: sum is -2.

-12: sum is -3.

so the order should be sorted based on these sums, from smallest to largest.

so the order of sums is: -3 (from -12), -2 (from -11), -1 (from -1), 1 (from 1), 2 (from 11).

so the expected sorted order is: -12, -11, -1, 1, 11.

but the function's output is [-12, -1, -11, 1, 11], which is different.

wait, that can't be right. because in the function's output, -1 comes before -11, but their sums are -1 and -2. so -2 is less than -1, so -11 should come before -1.

so the function's sorting is incorrect because it's not correctly ordering the elements based on their sum.

wait, but in the sumdigit array, after sorting, the order is [-3, -1, -2, 1, 2]. so the function is arranging the sumdigit in ascending order, but the way the bubble sort is implemented might not correctly handle this.

wait, the bubble sort in the code is comparing sumdigit[j-1] and sumdigit[j], and if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], it swaps. so it's sorting in ascending order.

but in the sumdigit array, the initial sums are [1, 2, -1, -2, -3].

after the first pass, the sumdigit becomes [1, -1, 2, -2, -3], but wait, no, let me re-examine the first pass.

wait, perhaps i made a mistake in tracking the sumdigit changes during the passes.

alternatively, perhaps the function is incorrectly calculating the sum for negative numbers.

wait, looking back at the code:

for each number, it converts to absolute value, then for each character after the first, adds (w[j] -48) to sum. then, if the number is positive, adds the first digit (w[0]-48) to sum. if negative, subtracts the first digit.

wait, for example, for -1:

abs is 1, string is ""1"". sum starts at 0. since it's negative, sum -= (1 -48). wait, 1-48 is 49 in ascii? wait, no, wait: '1' is ascii 49, so 49 -48 is 1. so for -1, sum is 0 -1 = -1.

for -11: string is ""11"". sum starts at 0. then, for j=1, add 1 (since '1' is 49-48=1). so sum is 1. then, since it's negative, subtract the first digit (1). so sum is 1 -1 = 0? wait, no, wait:

wait, the code is:

sum = 0;

for j from 1 to w.length()-1:

sum += w[j] -48.

then, if positive, sum += w[0]-48.

else, sum -= w[0]-48.

so for -11:

w is ""11"".

sum starts at 0.

j runs from 1 to 1 (since length is 2, j starts at 1 and goes up to 1).

sum += w[1] -48 = 1.

then, since nums[i] is negative, sum -= w[0]-48 = 1.

so sum is 1 -1 = 0.

wait, that's different from what i thought earlier. so i must have made a mistake in calculating the sum for -11.

wait, let me recalculate all the sums correctly.

let me go through each number again:

1. 1: positive.

abs is 1, string ""1"".

sum starts at 0.

no j loop (since length is 1, j starts at 1 which is beyond the string length).

then, since positive, add w[0]-48 = 1.

sum is 1.

2. 11: positive.

abs is 11, string ""11"".

sum starts at 0.

j=1: w[1] is '1' → 1. sum becomes 1.

then, add w[0] (1) → sum is 2.

3. -1: negative.

abs is 1, string ""1"".

sum starts at 0.

no j loop.

subtract w[0] (1) → sum is -1.

4. -11: negative.

abs is 11, string ""11"".

sum starts at 0.

j=1: add 1 → sum is 1.

subtract w[0] (1) → sum is 0.

5. -12: negative.

abs is 12, string ""12"".

sum starts at 0.

j=1: add 2 → sum is 2.

subtract w[0] (1) → sum is 1.

wait, that's different from before. so the sumdigit array is [1, 2, -1, 0, 1].

wait, that changes everything.

so the initial sumdigit is [1, 2, -1, 0, 1].

so the sum for each number is:

1 → 1

11 → 2

-1 → -1

-11 → 0

-12 → 1.

now, the function sorts based on these sums.

so the sumdigit array is [1, 2, -1, 0, 1].

the function's bubble sort will arrange the sumdigit in ascending order.

let's see how the sorting proceeds.

initial nums: [1, 11, -1, -11, -12]

sumdigit: [1, 2, -1, 0, 1]

we need to sort the nums based on sumdigit, and if sums are equal, based on original index.

so the desired order is sorted by sumdigit ascending, then by index.

so let's list each element with its sum and index:

index 0: sum 1

index 1: sum 2

index 2: sum -1

index 3: sum 0

index 4: sum 1

so the order should be:

sum -1 (index 2), sum 0 (index3), sum 1 (index0), sum1 (index4), sum2 (index1).

so the sorted nums should be [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11].

which matches the expected result.

but let's see how the function's sorting works.

the function's sumdigit is [1, 2, -1, 0, 1].

the function uses a bubble sort, comparing adjacent elements and swapping if the earlier is larger.

let me walk through each pass.

first pass (i=0):

j runs from 1 to 4.

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=1 and sumdigit[1]=2. 1 < 2 → no swap.

j=2: compare sumdigit[1]=2 and sumdigit[2]=-1. 2 > -1 → swap.

sumdigit becomes [1, -1, 2, 0, 1].

nums becomes [1, -1, 11, -11, -12].

j=3: compare sumdigit[2]=2 and sumdigit[3]=0. 2>0 → swap.

sumdigit becomes [1, -1, 0, 2, 1].

nums becomes [1, -1, -11, 11, -12].

j=4: compare sumdigit[3]=2 and sumdigit[4]=1. 2>1 → swap.

sumdigit becomes [1, -1, 0, 1, 2].

nums becomes [1, -1, -11, -12, 11].

so after first pass, sumdigit is [1, -1, 0, 1, 2], nums is [1, -1, -11, -12, 11].

second pass (i=1):

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=1 and sumdigit[1]=-1. 1 > -1 → swap.

sumdigit becomes [-1, 1, 0, 1, 2].

nums becomes [-1, 1, -11, -12, 11].

j=2: compare sumdigit[1]=1 and sumdigit[2]=0. 1>0 → swap.

sumdigit becomes [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2].

nums becomes [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11].

j=3: compare sumdigit[2]=1 and sumdigit[3]=1. equal → no swap.

j=4: compare sumdigit[3]=1 and sumdigit[4]=2. 1 < 2 → no swap.

third pass (i=2):

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=-1 and sumdigit[1]=0. -1 < 0 → no swap.

j=2: compare sumdigit[1]=0 and sumdigit[2]=1. 0 <1 → no swap.

j=3: compare sumdigit[2]=1 and sumdigit[3]=1. equal → no swap.

j=4: compare sumdigit[3]=1 and sumdigit[4]=2. 1 <2 → no swap.

fourth pass (i=3):

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=-1 and sumdigit[1]=0. no swap.

j=2: compare sumdigit[1]=0 and sumdigit[2]=1. no swap.

j=3: compare sumdigit[2]=1 and sumdigit[3]=1. no swap.

j=4: compare sumdigit[3]=1 and sumdigit[4]=2. no swap.

so after all passes, the sumdigit is [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2], and nums is [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11].

which matches the expected result.

wait, but earlier i thought the sum for -11 was 0, and for -12 was 1. so the sumdigit after sorting is [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2], which corresponds to the nums [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11].

so the function's output is correct.

but wait, earlier i thought that the sum for -12 was 1, but according to the code, let's recheck:

for -12:

abs is 12 → string """
"assert (issame(order_by_points({1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46}) , {0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}));",unknown,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the provided c++ function correctly sorts the vector according to the sum of the digits of each integer. the assertion given is comparing the output of the function with a specific expected vector. let me break down the problem step by step.

first, i'll look at the function `order_by_points`. the function takes a vector of integers and returns a new vector sorted based on the sum of their digits. if two numbers have the same sum, they should retain their original order from the input vector.

let me analyze how the function calculates the sum of the digits. the code converts each number to its absolute value as a string. then, it iterates through each character in the string, starting from the second character (index 1), adding each digit to the sum. for positive numbers, it adds the first digit (index 0) as well. for negative numbers, it subtracts the first digit. wait, that doesn't seem right. because for negative numbers, the first character is '-', but in the code, it's taking `w[0] - 48`, which would be '-' minus 48, which is not a digit. oh wait, no, because `abs(nums[i])` is taken, so `w` is the absolute value as a string. so for negative numbers, the string doesn't have a '-', so `w[0]` is the first digit. but in the code, for negative numbers, it subtracts `w[0] -48` from the sum. that would make the sum negative for the first digit of negative numbers. wait, that can't be correct because the sum should be the sum of the digits regardless of the sign. for example, -123 should have a sum of 1+2+3=6.

looking at the code again: for each number, it's converted to its absolute value as a string. so for -123, the string is ""123"". then, for j starting from 1, it adds w[j] -48, which is 2 and 3, summing to 5. then, since the original number was negative, it subtracts w[0]-48, which is 1. so the sum becomes 5 -1 =4. but the correct sum should be 1+2+3=6. so this approach is wrong. it's subtracting the first digit for negative numbers, which is incorrect.

wait, that's a mistake. the sum of digits should be the sum of all digits, regardless of the sign. so for -123, the sum is 1+2+3=6. but the code is adding the digits from index 1 onwards, which for ""123"" is 2+3=5, then subtracting the first digit (1) because the number is negative. so 5-1=4, which is wrong. so the sum calculation is incorrect for negative numbers.

this is a critical error. the function is miscalculating the sum for negative numbers. so any negative number's sum will be wrong. for example, in the sample given in the problem statement: {1, 11, -1, -11, -12} should be ordered as {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}. let's compute the sums correctly:

1: sum is 1
11: 1+1=2
-1: 1
-11: 1+1=2
-12:1+2=3

so the correct order based on sum (and original index for ties) would be:
-1 (sum 1, index 2), -11 (sum 2, index 3), 1 (sum 1, index 0), -12 (sum 3, index4), 11 (sum 2, index1). wait, no, wait: the correct order in the sample is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, let's see the sample:

input: {1, 11, -1, -11, -12}
the sums are:
1:1
11:2
-1:1
-11:2
-12:3

so the order should be sorted by sum, then by original index.

so the elements with sum 1 are 1 (index0) and -1 (index2). so in the sorted list, -1 comes before 1 because it's later in the original vector? wait, no, wait: when two elements have the same sum, they are ordered based on their index in the original vector. so the one with the smaller index comes first.

wait, no: the note says, ""order them based on their index in original vector."" so if two items have the same sum, the one that appeared earlier (smaller index) comes first.

so in the sample, 1 is at index0, -1 at index2. both have sum1. so in the sorted list, 1 should come before -1. but the sample output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}, which suggests that -1 is first. that's conflicting.

wait, perhaps i'm misunderstanding the note. let me read it again: ""if there are several items with similar sum of their digits, order them based on their index in original vector."" so the original order is preserved for items with the same sum. so in the sample, the original vector is [1,11,-1,-11,-12]. the sums are 1,2,1,2,3.

so the sorted order by sum would be:

sum 1: 1 (index0), -1 (index2)
sum 2: 11 (index1), -11 (index3)
sum3: -12 (index4)

so the order should be 1, -1, 11, -11, -12. but the sample output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}, which is different. hmm, perhaps i'm misunderstanding the sample.

wait, the sample says:

order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) == {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}

wait, let's compute the sums correctly:

1: sum is 1
11: 1+1=2
-1: 1 (since it's -1, absolute is 1, sum is 1)
-11: 1+1=2
-12:1+2=3

so the elements in order of sum:

sum1: 1 (index0), -1 (index2)
sum2: 11 (index1), -11 (index3)
sum3: -12 (index4)

so when sorted by sum, the order should be 1, -1, 11, -11, -12. but the sample output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}, which is different. so perhaps the sample is incorrect, or perhaps i'm misunderstanding the sorting.

wait, perhaps the function is supposed to sort in ascending order of sum, but for same sums, the elements are ordered based on their original index. so the first occurrence comes first.

wait, in the sample, the function returns {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, let's see the sum of each element in the sample output:

-1: sum1
-11: sum2
1: sum1
-12: sum3
11: sum2

so the order is based on sum, but the elements with sum1 are ordered as -1, then 1. but in the original vector, 1 is at index0, -1 at index2. so when sum is same, the one with smaller index comes first. so 1 should come before -1. but in the sample output, -1 comes first. so that suggests that the function is not correctly handling the ordering for same sums.

but perhaps the function is incorrectly handling the sum calculation, which would affect the order.

but back to the main problem: the function's sum calculation is wrong for negative numbers. so in the given assertion, the function will produce incorrect sums, leading to incorrect ordering.

so the assertion is:

order_by_points({1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46}) 

should equal 

{0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}

let me compute the correct sum for each number in the input vector, then sort them accordingly.

first, list all the numbers and their indices:

index 0: 1234
index1:423
index2:463
index3:145
index4:2
index5:423
index6:423
index7:53
index8:6
index9:37
index10:3457
index11:3
index12:56
index13:0
index14:46

compute sum of digits for each:

0:1234 → 1+2+3+4=10
1:423 →4+2+3=9
2:463 →4+6+3=13
3:145 →1+4+5=10
4:2 →2
5:423 →9
6:423 →9
7:53 →5+3=8
8:6 →6
9:37 →3+7=10
10:3457 →3+4+5+7=19
11:3 →3
12:56 →5+6=11
13:0 →0
14:46 →4+6=10

so the sums are:

index0:10
index1:9
index2:13
index3:10
index4:2
index5:9
index6:9
index7:8
index8:6
index9:10
index10:19
index11:3
index12:11
index13:0
index14:10

now, the correct order is sorted by sum ascending, then by original index.

let's list all elements with their sum and index:

element: sum, index
0:10,0
1:9,1
2:13,2
3:10,3
4:2,4
5:9,5
6:9,6
7:8,7
8:6,8
9:10,9
10:19,10
11:3,11
12:11,12
13:0,13
14:10,14

now, sort them first by sum, then by index.

the sums in order: 0,2,3,6,8,9,9,9,10,10,10,10,11,13,19.

so the elements in order:

sum 0: index13 →0
sum2: index4 →2
sum3: index11 →3
sum6: index8 →6
sum8: index7 →53
sum9: index1 →423, index5 →423, index6 →423
sum10: index0 →1234, index3 →145, index9 →37, index14 →46
sum11: index12 →56
sum13: index2 →463
sum19: index10 →3457

so the sorted order should be:

0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423 (index1), 423 (index5), 423 (index6), 1234 (index0), 145 (index3), 37 (index9), 46 (index14), 56 (index12), 463 (index2), 3457 (index10)

so the expected output in the assertion is {0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}.

but wait, in the expected vector, after 53 comes 423,423,423, then 1234,145, etc. so the expected output is correct.

now, let's see what the function does. the function has a bug in sum calculation for negative numbers, but in the given assertion, all numbers are positive except 0. so the function's sum calculation for positive numbers is correct.

wait, let's check how the function calculates the sum for positive numbers. for a positive number, it converts to string, then for j from 1 to end, adds each digit. then adds the first digit (w[0]-48). so for 1234, the string is ""1234"". j starts at 1, so digits 2,3,4 are added: 2+3+4=9. then adds w[0]-48 which is 1. so sum is 10, which is correct.

for 423: j=1,2: 2+3=5, plus 4 →9. correct.

for 2: j starts at 1, but the string is ""2"", length 1. so j loop doesn't run. then adds w[0]-48 →2. correct.

so for positive numbers, the sum is correct.

but in the function, the sorting is done using a bubble sort approach. let's see how it's implemented.

the function creates sumdigit vector, then for each i from 0 to n-1, and for j from 1 to n-1, it checks if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j]. if so, swaps sumdigit and nums elements.

wait, that's a standard bubble sort, but the way it's written may have issues. let me see:

the outer loop is for i from 0 to nums.size()-1. the inner loop is j from 1 to nums.size()-1. so for each i, it's doing a pass through the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping if needed.

but in bubble sort, the outer loop should run for n-1 times, and the inner loop runs from 0 to n-i-1. the way it's written here, for each i, it's comparing j from 1 to the end, which may not correctly implement bubble sort. wait, no: the code is written as:

for (int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)
    for (int j=1;j<nums.size();j++)
        if (sumdigit[j-1]>sumdigit[j])
        {
            swap sumdigit and nums
        }

wait, that's not correct. because for each i, it's iterating j from 1 to the end, which would cause multiple swaps in a single i iteration. but in bubble sort, each i represents a pass that pushes the largest element to the end. so the inner loop should run from 0 to n-i-1.

in the current code, for each i, j runs from 1 to the end, which is incorrect. it may not correctly sort the array because it's not limiting the inner loop's range as i increases. so the sorting may not be stable or correct.

wait, let's think about it. suppose the list is [5,3,1]. the first i=0, j runs from 1 to 2.

j=1: compare 5 and 3 → swap → [3,5,1]
j=2: compare 5 and 1 → swap → [3,1,5]

then i=1, j runs from 1 to 2.

j=1: compare 3 and 1 → swap → [1,3,5]
j=2: compare 3 and5 → no swap.

i=2, j runs from 1 to 2.

j=1: compare 1 and3 → no swap.
j=2: compare3 and5 → no swap.

so after i=0, the array becomes [3,1,5], then after i=1, [1,3,5]. so it works for this case. but is this implementation correct in general?

wait, in the standard bubble sort, the inner loop runs for j from 0 to n-i-1. so for each i, the largest i+1 elements are bubbled up. but in this code, for each i, it's comparing all adjacent pairs again, which may lead to more passes than necessary but may still sort correctly. however, the issue is that the swapping is done for all j in each i, which may not correctly handle elements that need to move multiple positions.

but more importantly, the code may not correctly handle the case where elements have the same sum. because when sumdigit[j-1] == sumdigit[j], the code doesn't swap, which is correct because we want to maintain the original order for same sums. so the sorting is stable in that sense.

wait, no. bubble sort as implemented here is not a stable sort because if two elements have the same sum, their order may be swapped if a larger element is found later. wait, no: in the code, if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], it swaps. so if sumdigit[j-1] == sumdigit[j], it doesn't swap, so the original order is preserved. so for same sums, the elements remain in their original order, which is correct.

but the problem is that the function's sorting algorithm may not correctly sort all cases because the inner loop doesn't adjust its range. let's take an example where the list is [3,2,1]. the function's code would:

i=0:
j=1: 3>2 → swap → [2,3,1]
j=2: 3>1 → swap → [2,1,3]
i=1:
j=1: 2>1 → swap → [1,2,3]
j=2: 2<3 → no swap.
i=2:
j=1: 1<2 → no swap.
j=2: 2<3 → no swap.

so it correctly sorts the list in 3 passes. so perhaps the sorting is correct despite the non-standard implementation.

but perhaps the main issue is the sum calculation for negative numbers, but in the given assertion, all numbers are non-negative except 0, so the sum calculation is correct.

so, the function's sum calculation is correct for the given assertion's input. now, the sorting may be correct as well.

wait, but let's see: in the given assertion, the input is:

{1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46}

the function's sumdigit for each element is correct because all are positive or zero.

so the sumdigit vector would be:

10,9,13,10,2,9,9,8,6,10,19,3,11,0,10

now, the function sorts the nums based on sumdigit.

so the sorted order should be as per the expected vector.

but let's see how the function's sorting works.

the function"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({}) , {}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c++ code. the function in question is order_by_points, which sorts a vector of integers based on the sum of their digits. the assertion is checking if the function returns an empty vector when given an empty vector.

first, i'll look at the code. the function starts by initializing a vector sumdigit. then, it loops through each element in the input vector nums. for each number, it converts the absolute value to a string to calculate the sum of its digits.

wait, but what happens if nums is empty? let's see. the loop for (int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++) won't execute at all because nums.size() is zero. so sumdigit remains empty.

next, there's a nested loop for sorting. the outer loop runs from i=0 to nums.size()-1, which is 0 to -1 if nums is empty. so that loop won't run either. similarly, the inner loop j starts from 1, but if nums is empty, j will be 1 which is greater than nums.size()-1 (which is -1), so the inner loop doesn't execute.

so the function just returns nums, which was empty. therefore, when the input is an empty vector, the output is also empty.

the assertion is checking if order_by_points({}) equals {}, which should be true. so the assertion should pass.

i don't see any issues in the code that would cause a problem with an empty input. the function handles it correctly by doing nothing and returning the empty vector as is.
</think>

the assertion passes because the function correctly returns an empty vector when given an empty input.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3}) , {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}));",unknown,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails when using the provided c++ function. let's break this down step by step.

first, i'll look at the function `order_by_points`. it's supposed to sort a vector of integers based on the sum of their digits. if two numbers have the same sum, they should be ordered based on their original indices.

let me understand how the function works. 

the function starts by calculating the sum of the digits for each number in the input vector. it does this by converting each number to its absolute value as a string. then, it iterates through each character of the string, converting them back to integers and summing them. however, there's a part that catches my eye: for positive numbers, it adds the first digit, but for negative numbers, it subtracts the first digit. wait, that doesn't seem right. because for a negative number, the first character is '-', but in the code, `w` is the absolute value, so the first character is actually the first digit. so for negative numbers, the code subtracts that digit. hmm, that might be a mistake because the sum of digits should be the sum of all digits regardless of the sign. for example, -11 should have a digit sum of 1 + 1 = 2, but according to the code, it would subtract 1, giving a sum of -1 + 1 = 0. that's incorrect.

wait, let me re-examine the code. the code converts the number to its absolute value, so for -11, `w` is ""11"". then, for j starting from 1, it adds w[j] - 48. so for j=1, it's '1' -48 is 1. then, since the original number is negative, it subtracts w[0] -48, which is 1. so the sum is 1 (from j=1) minus 1 (from w[0]) equals 0. but the correct sum should be 1+1=2. so this is a bug. the function is incorrectly calculating the sum for negative numbers by subtracting the first digit instead of adding it.

this mistake will affect the sorting because the sumdigit values are wrong for negative numbers. so the sorting order will be incorrect.

now, looking at the assertion. the input is {1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3}. let's compute the correct sum of digits for each number and see what the expected order should be.

let's list each number and their correct sum:

1: digits sum is 1.
-11: digits are 1 and 1, sum is 2.
-32: 3 + 2 =5.
43:4+3=7.
54:5+4=9.
-98:9+8=17.
2:2.
-3:3.

wait, wait. wait, no. wait, for negative numbers, the sum should be the sum of the digits, ignoring the sign. so for -11, it's 1+1=2. for -32, 3+2=5. for -98, 9+8=17. for -3, 3.

so the correct sum for each number in the input is:

1:1
-11:2
-32:5
43:7
54:9
-98:17
2:2
-3:3

now, the function is supposed to sort based on these sums. if two numbers have the same sum, their order is determined by their original index.

so let's list each number with their sum and index:

index 0: 1, sum 1
index 1: -11, sum 2
index 2: -32, sum5
index3:43, sum7
index4:54, sum9
index5:-98, sum17
index6:2, sum2
index7:-3, sum3

now, the correct sorted order based on sum and then index:

we need to sort the numbers in ascending order of their sum. so the order of sums would be:

1 (index0), 2 (index1), 2 (index6), 3 (index7),5 (index2),7 (index3),9 (index4),17 (index5).

wait, no. let's list all the sums in order:

the sums are:

1, 2,5,7,9,17,2,3.

so the sorted order of sums is:

1 (sum1), 2 (sum2), 2 (sum2), 3 (sum3),5 (sum5),7 (sum7),9 (sum9),17 (sum17).

now, for the two numbers with sum2: index1 (-11) and index6 (2). since index1 comes before index6, in the sorted array, -11 should come before 2.

similarly, the other sums are unique except for sum2.

so the correct sorted order of the numbers should be:

1 (sum1), -11 (sum2, index1), 2 (sum2, index6), -3 (sum3, index7), -32 (sum5, index2),43 (sum7, index3),54 (sum9, index4), -98 (sum17, index5).

so the expected output is: {1, -11, 2, -3, -32,43,54,-98}.

wait, but the assertion is:

assert (issame(order_by_points({1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3}) , {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}));

wait, the expected array in the assertion is {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}.

but according to my calculation, the correct order should be 1, -11, 2, -3, -32,43,54,-98.

so the assertion expects a different order. that suggests that either the function is incorrect, or perhaps i made a mistake in the expected order.

wait, perhaps i should re-examine the function's behavior.

but wait, the function has a bug in calculating the sum for negative numbers. so the sumdigit array is incorrect, leading to incorrect sorting.

let me compute what the function does for each number.

let's go through each number in the input vector and compute the sumdigit as per the function.

the input vector is: [1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3]

compute sumdigit for each:

1: positive. w is ""1"". j starts from 1, but w.length() is 1, so the inner loop doesn't run. then, since it's positive, add w[0]-48 (1). so sum is 1.

-11: w is ""11"". j starts from 1, so j=1: '1' -48 =1. sum is 1. then, since the number is negative, subtract w[0]-48 (1). so sum is 1 -1 =0.

-32: w is ""32"". j=1: '2' -48=2. sum is 2. then subtract w[0]-48 (3). sum=2-3= -1.

43: positive. w is ""43"". j=1: '3'-48=3. sum is 3. then add w[0]-48 (4). sum=3+4=7.

54: positive. w is ""54"". j=1: '4'-48=4. sum=4. add '5'-48=5. sum=4+5=9.

-98: w is ""98"". j=1: '8'-48=8. sum=8. subtract '9'-48=9. sum=8-9= -1.

2: positive. w is ""2"". j starts at 1, no loop. add '2'-48=2. sum=2.

-3: w is ""3"". j starts at 1, no loop. subtract '3'-48=3. sum= -3.

so the sumdigit array is:

1, 0, -1,7,9,-1,2,-3.

wait, let me list them in order:

sumdigit[0] =1

sumdigit[1]=0

sumdigit[2]=-1

sumdigit[3]=7

sumdigit[4]=9

sumdigit[5]=-1

sumdigit[6]=2

sumdigit[7]=-3

so the sumdigit array is [1,0,-1,7,9,-1,2,-3].

now, the function sorts the nums vector based on sumdigit. it uses a bubble sort approach, comparing sumdigit[j-1] and sumdigit[j], swapping if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j].

so let's see how the sorting proceeds.

the initial nums vector is [1, -11, -32,43,54,-98,2,-3].

sumdigit is [1,0,-1,7,9,-1,2,-3].

the function's sorting loops:

it's a nested loop where for each i from 0 to n-1, and for each j from 1 to n-1, it checks if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j]. if so, swaps sumdigit and nums elements.

this is essentially a bubble sort, which sorts the array in ascending order based on sumdigit.

so let's simulate the sorting process.

initial sumdigit: [1,0,-1,7,9,-1,2,-3]

we need to sort this in ascending order, so the order of sumdigit after sorting would be:

-3, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2,7,9.

but wait, the sumdigit array is being sorted in ascending order, so the sorted sumdigit would be:

-3, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2,7,9.

but wait, the initial sumdigit is [1,0,-1,7,9,-1,2,-3].

let me list the sumdigit and the corresponding nums:

index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

sumdigit:1,0,-1,7,9,-1,2,-3

nums:1, -11, -32,43,54,-98,2,-3.

now, the function will perform a bubble sort, comparing adjacent elements and swapping if needed.

let's go through each pass.

first pass (i=0):

j runs from 1 to 7.

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=1 and sumdigit[1]=0. since 1>0, swap.

after swap:

sumdigit becomes [0,1,-1,7,9,-1,2,-3]

nums becomes [-11,1,-32,43,54,-98,2,-3].

j=2: compare sumdigit[1]=1 and sumdigit[2]=-1. 1 > -1: swap.

sumdigit: [0,-1,1,7,9,-1,2,-3]

nums: [-11,-32,1,43,54,-98,2,-3].

j=3: compare sumdigit[2]=1 and sumdigit[3]=7. 1 <7: no swap.

j=4: compare 7 and9: no swap.

j=5: compare 9 and -1: 9> -1: swap.

sumdigit: [0,-1,1,7,-1,9,2,-3]

nums: [-11,-32,1,43, -98,54,2,-3].

j=6: compare 9 and2: 9>2: swap.

sumdigit: [0,-1,1,7,-1,2,-3,9]

after first pass, sumdigit is [0,-1,1,7,-1,2,-3,9].

j runs from 1 to 7.

sumdigit: [-1,0,1,-1,2,-3,7,9]

nums: [-32,-11,1,-98,2,-3,43,54].

j=7: compare7 and9: no swap.

after second pass, sumdigit is [-1,0,1,-1,2,-3,7,9].

third pass (i=2):

j runs from 1 to7.

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=-1 and sumdigit[1]=0: -1 <0: no swap.

j=2: compare0 and1: no swap.

j=3: compare1 and-1:1> -1: swap.

sumdigit: [-1,0,-1,1,2,-3,7,9]

j=4: compare1 and2: no swap.

j=5: compare2 and-3:2> -3: swap.

sumdigit: [-1,0,-1,-3,2,1,7,9]

nums: [-32,-11,-98,-3,2,1,43,54].

wait, wait. let me re-examine the swap at j=5.

sumdigit before j=5: [ -1,0,-1,1,2,-3,7,9 ]

at j=5, sumdigit[j-1] is sumdigit[4]=2, sumdigit[j]= -3.

2 > -3: swap.

sumdigit becomes: [ -1,0,-1,1,-3,2,7,9 ]

nums becomes: [-32,-11,-98,1,-3,2,43,54].

"assert (issame(order_by_points({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}) , {1, 10, 2, 11, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}));",unknown,"<think>
okay, i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails when using the provided c++ function. let's start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

the function order_by_points takes a vector of integers and sorts them in ascending order based on the sum of their digits. if two numbers have the same sum, they should be ordered based on their original index in the vector.

let me look at the code step by step.

first, the function calculates the sum of digits for each number. it converts each number to its absolute value as a string. then, for each character in the string (excluding the first if the number is positive), it adds the digit value to the sum. wait, no, looking closer: for positive numbers, it adds the first character as well. for negative numbers, it subtracts the first character. hmm, that doesn't seem right. wait, let me see:

for a number like -12, the string is ""12"". the code does sum -= w[0] - 48. so for -12, w[0] is '1', so 49 - 48 is 1. so sum starts at 0, subtracts 1, making sum -1. then, for j starting at 1, it adds w[1] -48, which is 2. so sum becomes -1 + 2 = 1. so the sum for -12 is 1.

wait, but that's not correct. the sum of digits for -12 should be 1 + 2 = 3, but the sign is ignored in the sum. or wait, the problem says the sum of their digits. so for negative numbers, the minus sign is not a digit, so the sum should be the sum of the absolute value's digits.

wait, looking back at the example given in the problem statement: order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) returns {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}. let's compute the sum for each:

1: sum is 1.
11: 1+1=2.
-1: sum is 1.
-11: 1+1=2.
-12: 1+2=3.

so the sorted order based on sum would be -1 (sum 1), -11 (sum 2), 1 (sum 1), but wait, no, wait the order in the example is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, let me compute the sums correctly:

wait, the example input is {1, 11, -1, -11, -12}.

compute sum for each:

1: 1 → sum 1.
11: 1+1=2.
-1: 1 → sum 1.
-11: 1+1=2.
-12: 1+2=3.

so the sum array is [1,2,1,2,3].

now, the order should be sorted by sum, and for same sums, by original index.

so the original indices are 0:1, 1:11, 2:-1, 3:-11, 4:-12.

so the sum array is [1,2,1,2,3].

so the sorted order based on sum (ascending) would be:

first, elements with sum 1: indices 0 and 2. since 0 comes before 2, the order is 0, then 2.

then, elements with sum 2: indices 1 and 3. so 1 comes before 3.

then sum 3: index 4.

so the sorted order is 0,2,1,3,4. the corresponding values are 1, -1, 11, -11, -12.

wait, but the example output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}. wait, that doesn't match. hmm, maybe i'm misunderstanding the example.

wait, the example shows order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) == {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, let me compute the sum for each element again:

1: sum is 1.

11: 1+1=2.

-1: sum is 1 (since it's the absolute value, 1).

-11: 1+1=2.

-12: 1+2=3.

so the sum array is [1,2,1,2,3].

so the order should be sorted by sum, and for same sums, by original index.

so the elements are:

index 0: sum 1.

index 1: sum 2.

index 2: sum 1.

index 3: sum 2.

index 4: sum 3.

so the sorted order based on sum (ascending) would be:

first, the two elements with sum 1: index 0 and 2. since 0 comes before 2, the order is 0, then 2.

then, the two elements with sum 2: index 1 and 3. so 1 comes before 3.

then, index 4.

so the sorted order is 0,2,1,3,4. the values are 1, -1, 11, -11, -12.

but the example output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, that's different. so according to the example, the order is:

-1 (index 2), then -11 (index 3), then 1 (index 0), then -12 (index4), then 11 (index1).

wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum for -1 is 1, same as 1. so why is -1 coming before 1 in the sorted list?

ah, maybe i'm misunderstanding the sum calculation. let me re-examine the code.

in the code, for each number, it's converted to a string of its absolute value. then, for positive numbers, the first character is added to the sum. for negative numbers, the first character is subtracted.

wait, that's not correct. because for a negative number, the sum of digits should be the sum of all digits, ignoring the sign. so for -1, the sum is 1. for -11, it's 1+1=2. for -12, it's 1+2=3.

but according to the code, for negative numbers, the first digit is subtracted. so for -1:

sum starts at 0.

w is ""1"".

since nums[i] is negative, sum -= w[0] -48 → 49-48=1 → sum is -1.

then, j starts from 1, but since w.length() is 1, the loop doesn't run. so sum is -1.

wait, that's a problem. because the sum for -1 would be -1, but according to the problem statement, it should be 1.

so the code is incorrectly calculating the sum for negative numbers. it's subtracting the first digit instead of adding it.

that's a bug in the code.

so, for example, in the given example, the sum for -1 would be -1, which is less than 1's sum of 1. so in the sorted order, -1 would come before 1 because it has a smaller sum.

wait, but in the example, the output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

let me compute the sums as per the code:

for each number in {1,11,-1,-11,-12}:

1: positive. w is ""1"". sum starts at 0. j runs from 1 to length-1, which is 0, so no loop. sum += w[0]-48 → 1. so sum is 1.

11: positive. w is ""11"". sum starts at 0. j runs from 1 to 1 (since length is 2). so j=1: sum += '1' -48 → 1. then, since it's positive, sum += w[0]-48 → 1. so sum is 1+1=2.

-1: negative. w is ""1"". sum starts at 0. since negative, sum -= w[0]-48 → 1. so sum is -1.

-11: negative. w is ""11"". sum starts at 0. sum -= w[0]-48 → 1. then, j runs from 1 to 1: sum += w[1]-48 → 1. so sum is -1 +1 = 0.

-12: negative. w is ""12"". sum starts at 0. sum -= w[0]-48 → 1. then j runs from 1 to 1: sum += w[1]-48 → 2. so sum is -1 +2=1.

so the sum array is [1,2,-1,0,1].

so the order based on sum would be sorted in ascending order:

-1 (sum -1), 0 (sum 0), 1 (sum 1), 1 (sum 1), 2 (sum 2).

wait, but the sum array is [1,2,-1,0,1].

so the elements are:

index 0: sum 1.

index 1: sum 2.

index 2: sum -1.

index 3: sum 0.

index 4: sum 1.

so when sorted by sum in ascending order, the order of indices would be:

index 2 (sum -1), index3 (sum 0), index0 (sum1), index4 (sum1), index1 (sum2).

so the sorted vector would be [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11], which matches the example.

so the code's sum calculation is incorrect for negative numbers, but it's producing the correct order for the example. wait, that's confusing.

wait, the code is subtracting the first digit for negative numbers, which is wrong. but in the example, that leads to the correct output. so perhaps the code is correct, but i'm misunderstanding the sum calculation.

wait, no. the problem says to sum the digits, regardless of the sign. so for -1, the sum should be 1. but according to the code, it's -1.

so the code is incorrect. but in the example, the code's incorrect sum calculation leads to the correct output. so that's a problem.

wait, but in the example, the code's sum for -1 is -1, which is less than 1's sum of 1. so in the sorted order, -1 comes before 1, which is correct as per the example.

so the code's incorrect sum calculation is causing the correct order in the example, but it's actually a bug.

so the code is flawed because it's not correctly calculating the sum of digits for negative numbers.

now, moving on to the assertion given:

the assertion is:

order_by_points({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}) should equal {1,10,2,11,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

let's compute the sum for each number in the input vector.

input vector: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11].

compute sum of digits for each:

1: 1 → sum 1.

2: 2 → sum 2.

3:3 →3.

4:4 →4.

5:5 →5.

6:6 →6.

7:7 →7.

8:8 →8.

9:9 →9.

10:1+0=1.

11:1+1=2.

so the sum array is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2].

now, the function should sort the numbers based on their sum, and for same sums, based on their original index.

so the sum array is:

indices 0:1, 1:2, 2:3, 3:4, 4:5, 5:6, 6:7,7:8,8:9,9:1,10:2.

so the sorted order based on sum (ascending) and index:

first, sum 1: indices 0 and 9. 0 comes before 9.

then sum 2: indices 1 and 10. 1 comes before 10.

then sum3: index2.

then sum4: index3.

and so on.

so the order of indices is: 0,9,1,10,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

so the sorted vector should be [1,10,2,11,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].

which matches the assertion.

but wait, let's see what the code does.

the code's sum calculation for 10 is correct: 1+0=1.

for 11: 1+1=2.

but for negative numbers, the code's sum is wrong, but in this case, all numbers are positive, so the code's sum is correct.

so the code should correctly sort the vector as per the assertion.

wait, but let's see how the code's sorting works.

the code uses a bubble sort approach: for each i from 0 to n-1, and for j from 1 to n-1, it compares sumdigit[j-1] and sumdigit[j]. if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], it swaps both sumdigit and nums elements.

wait, but bubble sort in this way will sort the sumdigit array in ascending order, and the nums array accordingly.

so for the sum array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], the code will perform the following:

initially, sumdigit is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2].

in the first pass (i=0), j runs from 1 to 10.

at j=1: sumdigit[0]=1 < sumdigit[1]=2 → no swap.

j=2: 2<3 → no swap.

... until j=9: sumdigit[8]=9 > sumdigit[9]=1 → swap.

so after j=9, sumdigit becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,9,2].

and nums becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,9,11].

then j=10: sumdigit[9]=9 > sumdigit[10]=2 → swap.

sumdigit becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,2,9].

nums becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,9].

so after i=0, the sumdigit is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,2,9].

in the next passes, the code will continue to bubble sort.

but wait, the code's sorting is incorrect because it's using a bubble sort that doesn't correctly handle all inversions. it only makes one pass per i, but bubble sort requires multiple passes until no swaps occur.

wait, the code has two nested loops:

for (int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)
for (int j=1;j<nums.size();j++)
if (sumdigit[j-1]>sumdigit[j])
swap.

this is not a correct implementation of bubble sort. because in each i iteration, j runs from 1 to the end, but after each i, the largest element is bubbled to the end. however, the way the code is written, it's not correctly handling the passes.

wait, no. the code is incorrect because the inner loop runs from j=1 to j<nums.size(), which is the entire array each time. so for each i, it's doing a full pass, which is redundant. but more importantly, the swapping is done for each adjacent pair where sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], which is correct for bubble sort.

wait, but in bubble sort, each pass i moves the i-th largest element to its correct position. so the inner loop should run from j=1 to j < (nums.size() - i). otherwise, in each pass, it's checking elements that have already been sorted.

in the code, the inner loop runs j from 1 to nums.size()-1, regardless of i. so it's not optimizing, but it's still a correct bubble sort, just less efficient.

so, for the sum array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2], the code will correctly sort it into [1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], and the nums array will be reordered accordingly.

wait, let's see:

after the first pass (i=0), the largest element (9) is at the end.

in the next pass (i=1), j runs from 1 to 10 again.

but the code will continue to swap elements until the entire array is sorted.

so after all passes, the sumdigit array will be correctly sorted in ascending order.

so the nums array will be ordered as per the sum, and for same sums, the original order is preserved because when sums are equal, the code doesn't swap them, so their original order remains.

wait, no. because in the code, when sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], it swaps. so if sumdigit[j-1] == sumdigit[j], it doesn't swap, so the original order is maintained.

yes, that's correct.

so for the given assertion, the code should correctly sort the vector as [1,10,2,11,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], which matches the expected result.

but wait, earlier i thought the code's sum calculation for negative numbers is wrong, but in this case, all numbers are positive, so the sum is correct.

so the assertion should pass.

but wait, let me re-examine the code's sum calculation for positive numbers.

for positive numbers, the code adds the first digit and then the rest.

yes, for 10: w is ""10"". j starts at 1, so w[1] is '0' → 0. then, since it's positive, sum += w[0]-48 → 1. so sum is 1+0=1. correct.

for 11: sum is 1+1=2. correct.

so the code's sum calculation is correct for positive numbers.

thus, the code should correctly handle the assertion case.

so the assertion should pass.

but wait, let me think again about the code's sum calculation for negative numbers. because in the example given in the problem statement"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({0,6,6,-76,-21,23,4}) , {-76, -21, 0, 4, 23, 6, 6}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails when using the provided c++ function. let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

the function order_by_points takes a vector of integers and sorts them in ascending order based on the sum of their digits. if two numbers have the same sum, they should be ordered based on their original index in the vector.

looking at the example given in the code comments: order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) should return {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}. let me check why that is.

calculating the sum of digits for each number:
- 1: sum is 1.
- 11: 1+1=2.
- -1: the sum is treated as -1 (since it's negative, the sign is considered).
- -11: sum is -1 + (-1) = -2.
- -12: sum is -1 + (-2) = -3.

wait, no. wait, the function's code calculates the sum differently. let me look at the code.

in the code, for each number, it converts the absolute value to a string. then, for each character in the string starting from index 1, it adds (char - 48) to the sum. for the first character (index 0), if the original number is positive, it adds (char -48), else subtracts (char -48). 

wait, that's a bit confusing. let me think: for a positive number, the first digit is added normally. for a negative number, the first digit is subtracted. so for example, -12 becomes 1 and 2. the sum is (-1) + 2 = 1? or wait, let's see:

wait, the code does this:
sum starts at 0.
for each j from 1 to w.length()-1 (since j starts at 1), it adds w[j] -48. then, if the number is positive, it adds w[0]-48 to sum. if negative, it subtracts w[0]-48.

wait, no. let me look again:

if (nums[i] > 0) sum += w[0] -48;
else sum -= w[0] -48;

so for a positive number, the first digit is added. for a negative number, the first digit is subtracted.

so for example, let's take the number -12. the absolute value is 12, so w is ""12"". 

sum starts at 0.

j runs from 1 to w.length()-1, which is 1 in this case (since length is 2). so j=1: w[1] is '2', so sum += 2.

then, since the number is negative, sum -= (w[0] -48) which is 1. so sum is 2 -1 = 1.

wait, that's interesting. so the sum for -12 is 1.

wait, but in the example given in the code, the function returns {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

let me compute the sums for each number in that example:

numbers: 1, 11, -1, -11, -12.

1: positive. w is ""1"". sum starts at 0. j runs from 1, but since length is 1, j doesn't run. then add w[0]-48 (1) to sum. so sum is 1.

11: positive. w is ""11"". j runs from 1: add 1. then add 1 again. sum is 2.

-1: negative. w is ""1"". j doesn't run. subtract 1. sum is -1.

-11: negative. w is ""11"". j runs from 1: add 1. then subtract 1. sum is 1 -1 = 0.

-12: negative. w is ""12"". j runs from 1: add 2. subtract 1. sum is 2-1=1.

wait, so the sums are:

1: sum 1.

11: sum 2.

-1: sum -1.

-11: sum 0.

-12: sum 1.

so the order based on sum would be:

-1 (sum -1), then -11 (sum 0), then 1 (sum 1), then -12 (sum 1), then 11 (sum 2).

but wait, the function's example expects {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, but 1 and -12 both have sum 1. so their order is based on their original indices. in the input vector, 1 is at index 0, -12 is at index 4. so 1 comes before -12.

so the sorted order is correct as per the example.

now, the assertion given is:

assert (issame(order_by_points({0,6,6,-76,-21,23,4}) , {-76, -21, 0, 4, 23, 6, 6}));

i need to compute the sum for each number in the input vector and see if the function's output matches the expected vector.

let's list the input vector: {0,6,6,-76,-21,23,4}.

compute the sum for each element:

1. 0: positive. w is ""0"". sum starts at 0. j runs from 1, but length is 1, so no loop. add 0. sum is 0.

2. 6: positive. w is ""6"". sum is 6.

3. 6: same as above, sum is 6.

4. -76: negative. w is ""76"". j runs from 1: add 6. then subtract 7 (since it's negative). so sum is 6 -7 = -1.

5. -21: negative. w is ""21"". j runs from 1: add 1. subtract 2. sum is 1-2 = -1.

6. 23: positive. w is ""23"". j runs from 1: add 3. then add 2. sum is 5.

7. 4: positive. w is ""4"". sum is 4.

so the sum array is:

0: 0

6:6

6:6

-76: -1

-21: -1

23:5

4:4

now, we need to sort the original vector based on these sums in ascending order. if two elements have the same sum, their order is determined by their original index.

let's list each element with its sum and index:

index 0: 0, sum 0.

index 1:6, sum6.

index2:6, sum6.

index3:-76, sum-1.

index4:-21, sum-1.

index5:23, sum5.

index6:4, sum4.

now, the order of sums from smallest to largest:

-76 (sum -1, index3), -21 (sum-1, index4), 0 (sum0, index0), 4 (sum4, index6), 23 (sum5, index5), 6 (sum6, index1), 6 (sum6, index2).

wait, wait. let me list all the sums:

-76: -1

-21: -1

0:0

4:4

23:5

6:6

6:6

so the order should be:

first, the elements with sum -1. between index3 (-76) and index4 (-21), since their sums are the same, the one with the lower index comes first. so -76 comes before -21.

then, sum 0: index0 (0).

then sum4: index6 (4).

then sum5: index5 (23).

then sum6: index1 (6) and index2 (6). since index1 is lower than index2, 6 comes before 6.

so the sorted order should be: -76, -21, 0,4,23,6,6.

which matches the expected vector in the assertion: {-76, -21, 0,4,23,6,6}.

wait, but let me check the function's code to see if it correctly handles the sorting.

the function computes the sumdigit array, then does a bubble sort: for each i from 0 to size-1, and j from 1 to size-1. if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], swap sumdigit and nums.

wait, but bubble sort in this way may not correctly handle the original indices when sums are equal. because in bubble sort, when two elements have the same sum, their order may be swapped if the previous element is larger, but in this case, the sum is same, so the swap doesn't happen. wait, no: the condition is if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], then swap. so when sumdigit[j-1] == sumdigit[j], no swap occurs. so the relative order of elements with the same sum is preserved as per their original order.

wait, but in the code, the sumdigit is being built in the order of the original vector. then, during the sorting, when two elements have the same sum, their order remains as per their original indices because the swap only happens when the previous sum is larger.

wait, no. because in bubble sort, when comparing j-1 and j, if j-1 is larger, they swap. so for elements with same sum, the swap doesn't happen, so their order remains as per their original positions.

so the function should correctly maintain the original order for elements with the same sum.

so in the assertion case, the function should return the correct order.

wait, but let me think about the sum calculation again.

wait, for the number -76:

w is ""76"". j runs from 1: add 6. then, since the number is negative, subtract 7 (w[0] is '7', 7-48=7? wait, wait, wait. wait, '7' is a character. '7' -48 is 7, right? because '0' is 48, so '7' is 55, 55-48=7.

so for -76:

sum starts at 0.

j=1: add 6.

sum is 6.

then, since the number is negative, subtract 7.

sum is 6-7 = -1.

yes.

for -21:

w is ""21"". j=1: add 1. sum is 1.

then subtract 2 (since it's negative). sum is 1-2 = -1.

yes.

so the sum for -76 and -21 are both -1, which is correct.

so the function should sort them in the order of their indices: -76 is at index3, -21 at index4. so -76 comes first.

so the sorted vector should be as expected.

but wait, let me think about the function's code again.

in the code, the sumdigit is built correctly, but the sorting is done via a bubble sort that compares adjacent elements. so for each i from 0 to nums.size()-1, and j from 1 to nums.size()-1.

wait, the outer loop is for (int i=0;i<nums.size();i++), and the inner loop is for (int j=1;j<nums.size();j++). so it's a standard bubble sort implementation, which should correctly sort the array based on sumdigit.

but wait, in bubble sort, each pass i moves the largest element to its correct position. so after each i, the i-th largest element is in place.

but in this case, the comparison is whether sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j]. so the sorting is in ascending order.

so the function should correctly sort the array.

thus, the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me think about the sum calculation for 0.

0 is positive. w is ""0"". sum starts at 0. j runs from 1, but since length is 1, no loop. then add w[0]-48, which is 0. so sum is 0. correct.

what about 4: sum is 4.

23: sum is 2+3=5.

so the sum array is correct.

so the function should sort the vector correctly.

thus, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly calculates the sum of digits for each number, considering the sign, and sorts the vector based on these sums. the bubble sort implementation maintains the original order for elements with equal sums. the assertion's expected output matches the computed result.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
