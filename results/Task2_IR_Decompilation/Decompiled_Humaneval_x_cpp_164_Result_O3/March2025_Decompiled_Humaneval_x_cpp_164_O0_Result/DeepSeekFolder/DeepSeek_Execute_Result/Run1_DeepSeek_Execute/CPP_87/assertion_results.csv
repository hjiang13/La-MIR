assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to figure out whether the provided c++ code for the get_row function correctly passes the given assertions. let's start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

from the problem statement, the function get_row takes a 2d vector (lst) and an integer x. it should find all occurrences of x in the nested vectors and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors. each coordinate is {row, column}, starting from 0. the result needs to be sorted first by rows in ascending order, and within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

let me look at the examples provided to understand better.

first example:
get_row({
  {1,2,3,4,5,6},
  {1,2,3,4,1,6},
  {1,2,3,4,5,1}
}, 1) should return {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}.

looking at each row:
- row 0 has 1 at column 0.
- row 1 has 1 at column 4 and 0.
- row 2 has 1 at column 5 and 0.

so the output is ordered by row (0,1,2), and within each row, columns are in descending order. so for row 1, 4 comes before 0, and for row 2, 5 comes before 0.

now, looking at the code:

the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then it loops through each row (i from 0 to lst.size()-1). for each row, it loops j from the end of the row (lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. if the element at (i,j) is x, it appends {i,j} to out.

wait, so for each row, it's checking columns in reverse order (from last to first). so for row 1, j starts at 5, then 4, etc. so when it finds x, it adds the coordinates in the order of j decreasing.

so for row 1, the elements are 1,2,3,4,1,6. so j starts at 5 (element 6, not 1), then 4 (element 1, which is x). so {1,4} is added. then j=3,2,1,0. at j=0, element is 1, so {1,0} is added. so for row 1, the order in out is {1,4}, {1,0}.

similarly, for row 0, j starts at 5, but the first occurrence is at j=0, so {0,0} is added.

so the out vector is built as follows:
- row 0: {0,0}
- row 1: {1,4}, {1,0}
- row 2: {2,5}, {2,0}

so the out vector is {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}, which matches the expected output.

so the first example should pass.

second example:
get_row({}, 1) should return {}. the code initializes out as empty, and since lst is empty, the loop doesn't run. so out remains empty. correct.

third example:
get_row({{}, {1}, {1,2,3}}, 3) should return {{2,2}}.

looking at the input:
- row 0 is empty, so no elements.
- row 1 has {1}, so no 3.
- row 2 has {1,2,3}, so 3 is at column 2.

in the code, for row 2, j starts at 2 (since size is 3, j starts at 2, then 1, 0). so when j=2, element is 3, so {2,2} is added. so the output is {{2,2}}, which is correct.

so all the examples should pass.

wait, but let's think about the code's sorting. the code loops through each row in order, and for each row, it appends the coordinates in reverse column order. so the final out vector is ordered by rows in ascending order, and within each row, columns are in descending order. so the code correctly builds the output in the required order without needing any further sorting.

therefore, the code should handle all cases correctly, and the assertions should pass.
</think>

the code correctly implements the required functionality. it iterates through each row and within each row, checks columns in reverse order, appending the coordinates as specified. all provided test cases are handled correctly.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the provided c++ code for the get_row function correctly passes the given assertions. let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

from the problem statement, the function get_row takes a 2d vector (lst) and an integer x. it should find all occurrences of x in the nested vectors and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors. each coordinate is {row, column}, starting from 0. the result should be sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

looking at the examples:

1. the first example has a 3-row matrix. for x=1, the function returns coordinates sorted by row, and within each row, the columns are in descending order. so for row 0, the 1 is at column 0. for row 1, it's at columns 4 and 0, so they are added in 4, then 0 order. similarly for row 2, columns 5 and 0.

2. the second example is an empty list, so the result is empty.

3. the third example has a list where some rows are empty. the x=3 is found in row 2, column 2.

now, looking at the code:

the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then, it iterates over each row (i from 0 to lst.size()-1). for each row, it iterates j from the end of the row (lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. for each element, if it equals x, it appends {i,j} to out.

wait, but the way it's appending is that for each row, it's checking from the end to the beginning. so for a row, the first occurrence found is the last element, then the one before, etc. so within a row, the columns are added in descending order. that's correct because the inner loop starts from the end and moves backward.

but wait, the outer loop is i from 0 to size-1, so rows are processed in order. so the final out vector will have all the coordinates ordered by row in ascending order, and within each row, columns are in descending order. so that's correct.

now, let's test the code against the examples.

first example:

input:
{
  {1,2,3,4,5,6},
  {1,2,3,4,1,6},
  {1,2,3,4,5,1}
}, x=1.

processing each row:

row 0: elements are 1,2,3,4,5,6. so j starts at 5, then 4, etc. the first element is 1 at j=0. so when j=0, it's added. so out gets {0,0}.

row 1: elements are 1,2,3,4,1,6. so j starts at 5 (6), then 4 (1). so when j=4, it's 1, so {1,4} is added. then j=3 (4), no. j=2 (3), no. j=1 (2), no. j=0 (1), so {1,0} is added. so row 1 contributes {1,4}, {1,0}.

row 2: elements are 1,2,3,4,5,1. so j starts at 5 (1), so {2,5} is added. then j=4 (5), no. j=3 (4), no. j=2 (3), no. j=1 (2), no. j=0 (1), so {2,0} is added. so row 2 contributes {2,5}, {2,0}.

so the out vector is { {0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0} }, which matches the expected output.

second example: empty list, so the function returns empty. correct.

third example: { {}, {1}, {1,2,3} }, x=3.

row 0 is empty, so nothing added.

row 1 has 1, which is not 3, so nothing.

row 2 has elements 1,2,3. so j starts at 2 (3), which is x=3. so {2,2} is added. so the output is { {2,2} }, which is correct.

so the code seems to handle all the examples correctly.

wait, but let me think about the order in which the coordinates are added. for each row, the inner loop is from the end to the start, so for each row, the columns are added in descending order. so within a row, the order is correct.

now, what about rows with multiple x's? like in the first example, row 1 has x at j=4 and j=0. so in the code, j starts at 5, then 4 (found x, added), then 3, 2, 1, 0 (found x, added). so the order is {1,4}, {1,0}, which is correct.

so the code seems to correctly handle all cases.

wait, but what about the case where a row has x in the middle? let's say a row is {5,1,3,1,4}. so x=1 occurs at j=1 and j=3. the inner loop starts from j=4, then 3 (found x, added), then 2, then 1 (found x, added). so the order is {i,3}, {i,1}, which is correct as 3>1.

so the code should be correct.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the code correctly implements the required functionality. it iterates through each row and within each row, checks elements from the end to the beginning, ensuring that the columns are added in descending order. the rows are processed in ascending order, so the final output is correctly ordered as specified.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to figure out whether the provided c++ code for the get_row function correctly passes the given assertion. let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

from the problem statement, the function get_row takes a 2d vector (lst) and an integer x. it should find all occurrences of x in the nested vectors and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors. each coordinate is {row, column}, starting from 0. the result should be sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

looking at the examples provided:

1. in the first example, the input is a 3x6 matrix. the function is called with x=1. the output is a list of coordinates where 1 appears. the expected output is {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}. let me see why this is the case.

   - row 0: 1 is at column 0.
   - row 1: 1 is at columns 0 and 4. but since we're sorting columns in descending order within the row, 4 comes before 0.
   - row 2: 1 is at columns 0 and 5. again, 5 comes before 0.

   so the output is ordered by row, and within each row, columns are in descending order.

2. the second example is an empty list, so the output is empty.

3. the third example has a list where some rows are empty. the function is called with x=3. the only occurrence is in row 2, column 2.

now, looking at the code provided:

the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. it then iterates over each row (i from 0 to lst.size()-1). for each row, it iterates j from the end of the row (lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. for each element, if it equals x, it appends {i,j} to out.

wait, but the way the code is written, for each row, it's adding the columns in reverse order. so for row 1 in the first example, j starts at 5, then 4, etc. so when j=4, it's added first, then j=0. so the order within the row is 4, 0, which is correct as per the example.

but when the code collects all these, the out vector is built in the order of rows, and within each row, the columns are added in descending order. so when the function returns, the out vector is already in the correct order.

wait, but let's think about how the code is structured. for each row i, it loops j from the end to the beginning. so for row 0, j=0 is the only element, so it's added. for row 1, j starts at 5, then 4, etc. so when j=4 is found, it's added, then when j=0 is found, it's added after. so in the out vector, the order for row 1 is {1,4}, then {1,0}.

so the code is correctly adding the columns in descending order within each row.

but wait, the problem says to sort the coordinates initially by rows in ascending order, which the code does because it's processing rows from 0 upwards. then, within each row, the columns are in descending order because j starts from the end and goes down.

so the code seems to be correct.

now, looking at the assertion statement provided. the user wrote:

assert (issame(get_row({ ... }), ... ));

but the code provided is the function, and the examples are given. so perhaps the assertion is testing one of these examples.

wait, the user's code is the function, and the assertion is probably testing whether the function returns the expected output for a specific input.

but the assertion is incomplete in the user's message. it just says ""assert (issame(get_row({ ... }), ... ));"" so perhaps the user is asking to analyze whether the function passes the given examples.

so i need to check each example against the code.

let's take the first example:

input: {
  {1,2,3,4,5,6},
  {1,2,3,4,1,6},
  {1,2,3,4,5,1}
}, x=1.

expected output: {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}.

let's see what the code does.

for i=0, j starts at 5, goes down to 0.

at j=0, element is 1. so {0,0} is added.

for i=1, j starts at 5: element is 6, not 1. j=4: element is 1. so {1,4} is added. then j=3:4, j=2:3, j=1:2, j=0:1. so {1,0} is added.

for i=2, j starts at 5: element is 1. so {2,5} is added. then j=4:5, j=3:4, j=2:3, j=1:2, j=0:1. so {2,0} is added.

so the out vector becomes:

{ {0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0} }, which matches the expected output.

so the first example passes.

second example: get_row({}, 1) should return {}.

the code initializes out as empty. since lst is empty, the loop doesn't run, so out remains empty. correct.

third example: get_row({{}, {1}, {1,2,3}}, 3) should return {{2,2}}.

let's see:

i=0: the row is empty, so no elements.

i=1: row is {1}. j starts at 0, element is 1, not 3.

i=2: row is {1,2,3}. j starts at 2: element is 3. so {2,2} is added.

so the output is {{2,2}}, which is correct.

so all the examples pass.

wait, but what about the order in which the coordinates are added? for example, in the first example, the code adds row 0, then row 1, then row 2. within each row, columns are added in descending order.

so the code seems to correctly handle the sorting as per the problem statement.

another test case: suppose a row has multiple x's. for example, row 0 has x at columns 2 and 0. the code would add {0,2} first, then {0,0}, because j starts from the end.

wait, no. wait, j starts from the end and decrements. so for a row like {3,1,1,4}, x=1. the elements are at j=1 and j=2 (assuming 0-based). wait, no, let me index correctly.

wait, the row is {3,1,1,4}, indices 0:3, 1:1, 2:1, 3:4.

so j starts at 3, then 2, then 1, then 0.

at j=2: element is 1, so {i,2} is added.

then j=1: element is 1, so {i,1} is added.

so the order in out would be {i,2}, {i,1}, which is correct because 2>1, so within the row, they are in descending order.

so the code correctly adds the columns in descending order.

another test case: what if a row has x in j=5, j=3, j=1. the code would add them in the order 5,3,1, which is correct.

so the code seems to handle all cases correctly.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the provided code correctly implements the required functionality. it iterates through each row and within each row, checks elements from the last column to the first, collecting coordinates where the element equals x. the resulting coordinates are ordered by rows ascending and columns descending within each row, matching the problem's requirements. all test cases pass.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

the function in question is get_row, which takes a vector of vectors (lst) and an integer x. the goal is to find all occurrences of x in the nested vectors and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors. each coordinate is {row, column}, starting from 0. the result should be sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

looking at the examples provided:

1. the first example has a 3-row matrix. for x=1, the function returns coordinates where 1 appears. the output is ordered by row, and within each row, the columns are in descending order. so for row 0, column 0 is the only occurrence. for row 1, columns 4 and 0 are found, but since we're iterating from the end, 4 comes before 0. similarly for row 2, columns 5 and 0 are found, so 5 comes first.

2. the second example is an empty list, so the output is empty.

3. the third example has a list where some rows are empty. only the third row has a 3 at position 2, so the output is {{2,2}}.

now, looking at the code:

the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then, it loops through each row (i from 0 to lst.size()-1). for each row, it loops through the columns starting from the end (j from lst[i].size()-1 down to 0). if the element at [i][j] equals x, it appends {i, j} to out.

wait, but the way the loops are structured, for each row, the columns are checked from the end to the beginning. so for a row, the first occurrence found is the last element, then the second last, etc. so when adding to out, the coordinates for a row are added in reverse column order. but the problem requires that within a row, the columns are sorted in descending order. so this approach should work because for each row, we're processing columns from high to low, and adding them in that order. so the output for each row is already in the correct order.

but wait, the outer loop is by row in order, so the overall list is ordered by row in ascending order, which is correct.

so the code seems to correctly generate the required output.

now, the assertion given is:

assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));

so the function is called with an empty list and x=1. let's see what happens.

in the code, the outer loop runs for i from 0 to lst.size()-1. but if lst is empty, lst.size() is 0, so the loop doesn't run. so out remains empty. thus, get_row returns an empty vector, which matches the expected result. so the assertion should pass.

wait, but in c++, when you have a vector of vectors, even if it's empty, the function should return an empty vector. so yes, the code correctly returns an empty vector when the input is empty.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the assertion checks if the function correctly handles an empty input list. since the function returns an empty vector in this case, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails. the assertion is checking if the function get_row returns an empty vector when given the input {{1}} and x=2. 

let me first understand what the get_row function does. from the code, it looks like it's supposed to find all occurrences of the integer x in a 2d vector (lst) and return their coordinates. the coordinates are stored as vectors {row, column}, sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, sorted by column in descending order.

looking at the code, the function loops through each row (i) and for each row, it loops through the columns starting from the end (j = lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. for each element, if it equals x, it adds the coordinate {i,j} to the output vector.

now, the assertion is get_row({{1}}, 2). so the input is a vector containing a single row, which itself is a vector containing just 1. we're searching for x=2.

let me walk through the function step by step with this input.

first, the outer loop runs for i from 0 to lst.size()-1. since lst is {{1}}, lst.size() is 1, so i=0.

then, for each row i=0, the inner loop starts j at lst[0].size()-1, which is 0 (since the row has one element). so j starts at 0 and goes down to 0, so it only runs once.

in the inner loop, it checks if lst[0][0] == x. lst[0][0] is 1, and x is 2. so 1 != 2, so the condition is false. therefore, nothing is added to the output vector.

so the output remains empty. thus, the function returns an empty vector.

the assertion is checking if get_row({{1}}, 2) is the same as an empty vector. since the function returns empty, the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me make sure i didn't miss anything. are there any edge cases here? for example, what if the row is empty? but in this case, the row has one element, so it's handled correctly.

another thing to check: the function's loops. the inner loop is j starting from the end and moving backward. so for a row with one element, j=0 is checked. that's correct.

so yes, the function correctly returns an empty vector when x is not found. therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function `get_row` correctly returns an empty vector when searching for 2 in the input `{{1}}`, as 2 is not present. thus, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) , {{2, 2}}));",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding the problem and the code.

the function get_row is supposed to take a 2d vector (which is like a matrix but each row can have different lengths) and an integer x. it should find all occurrences of x in the matrix and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors. each coordinate is {row, column}, starting from 0. the result needs to be sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

looking at the examples provided:

1. the first example has a matrix with three rows. when searching for 1, it finds it in row 0, column 0; row 1, columns 4 and 0; and row 2, columns 5 and 0. the output is ordered by row, and within each row, the columns are in descending order. so for row 1, 4 comes before 0, and for row 2, 5 comes before 0.

2. the second example is an empty matrix, so the result is empty.

3. the third example has a matrix where the first row is empty, the second has one element (1), and the third has three elements (1,2,3). when searching for 3, it's found in row 2, column 2. so the output is {{2,2}}.

now, looking at the code:

the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then it loops through each row (i from 0 to lst.size()-1). for each row, it loops through the columns in reverse order, starting from the last index (j = lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. for each element, if it equals x, it appends {i,j} to out.

wait, but the way the loops are structured, for each row, it's adding the columns in reverse order. so for a row, the first occurrence (from the end) is added first. but when the function returns, the output is built by processing each row in order, and within each row, the columns are added in reverse order (from high to low). so for a row, the columns are in descending order as required.

but then, the function returns the out vector as is. so the overall order is rows in ascending order, and within each row, columns in descending order. that seems correct.

now, looking at the assertion statement:

assert (issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) , {{2, 2}}));

so the input matrix is:
- row 0: empty
- row 1: {1}
- row 2: {1,2,3}

we're searching for x=3.

in row 2, the elements are 1,2,3. so the index of 3 is 2 (since indexing starts at 0). so the function should find it and add {2,2} to the output.

let me simulate the code's execution for this case.

i starts at 0: the row is empty, so the inner loop doesn't run.

i=1: the row has one element. j starts at 0 (since size is 1, j=0). the element is 1, which is not equal to 3. so nothing is added.

i=2: the row has 3 elements. j starts at 2 (since size is 3, j=2). the element is 3, which matches x. so {2,2} is added to out. then j decreases to 1, which is 2, not 3. then j=0, which is 1, not 3. so only one element is added.

thus, the output is {{2,2}}, which matches the expected result in the assertion.

wait, but wait a second. let me check the code again. the inner loop is for (int j=lst[i].size()-1; j>=0; j--). so for row 2, j starts at 2, then 1, then 0. so the code checks index 2 first, finds 3, adds {2,2}. then checks 1 (2) and 0 (1), which don't match. so yes, only {2,2} is added.

so the function returns {{2,2}}, which is exactly what the assertion expects. therefore, the assertion should pass.

i don't see any issues here. the code correctly handles the case where the row is empty, and correctly processes each row in order, adding the columns in reverse order. so the assertion should pass.
</think>

the assertion passes because the function correctly identifies the position of the integer 3 in the given matrix and returns the expected coordinate.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
