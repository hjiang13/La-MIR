"assert (issame(order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) , {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}));",unknown,"<think>
okay, i need to analyze whether the provided c++ function correctly sorts the vector according to the sum of the digits, and then determine if the assertion passes or fails. let's break it down step by step.

first, let's understand the problem. the function order_by_points should sort the vector in ascending order based on the sum of each integer's digits. if two numbers have the same sum, they should maintain their original order based on their indices.

looking at the example given: order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) should return {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}. let's compute the sum of digits for each number to see why this is the case.

1. 1: sum is 1.
2. 11: sum is 1+1=2.
3. -1: sum is -1 (since it's negative, the sign affects the sum).
4. -11: sum is -1 + (-1) = -2.
5. -12: sum is -1 + 2 = 1.

wait, wait. wait a minute. how is the sum calculated for negative numbers? the problem says to sum the digits, but the example seems to treat negative signs as part of the digits. let me check the code.

in the code, for each number, it converts the absolute value to a string. then, for positive numbers, it adds each digit, including the first one. for negative numbers, it subtracts the first digit. so for -1, the string is ""1"", so sum is - (1 - 48) ? wait, wait, no. let me see.

wait, the code does this: for each number, it takes the absolute value, converts to string. then, for positive numbers, it adds the first digit (w[0] -48) to the sum. for negative numbers, it subtracts that first digit. so for example, -1 is treated as - (1) because the code does sum -= (w[0] -48). so the sum for -1 is -1.

similarly, for -11: the string is ""11"". the first digit is 1, so sum starts at 0, then for j=1, it's the second digit, which is 1, so sum += 1. then, since the number is negative, sum -= 1 (from w[0] -48). so total sum is 1 -1 = 0? wait, that can't be right because in the example, -11 comes before 1.

wait, maybe i'm misunderstanding the code. let me re-examine the code.

the code initializes sum to 0. then, for each character in the string starting from j=1 (so the second character), it adds (w[j] -48) to sum. then, if the original number is positive, it adds (w[0] -48) to sum. if negative, it subtracts (w[0] -48) from sum.

so for a positive number like 11: sum starts at 0. j runs from 1 to length-1. for ""11"", j=1 is the second '1', so sum += 1. then, since the number is positive, add the first digit (1) to sum. so total sum is 1 + 1 = 2.

for -1: the string is ""1"". j starts at 1, but the string length is 1, so the loop doesn't run. then, since the number is negative, subtract (1 -48) which is 1. so sum is 0 -1 = -1.

for -11: string is ""11"". j runs from 1 to 1 (since length is 2). so j=1: sum += 1. then, since the number is negative, subtract 1. so sum is 1 -1 = 0.

wait, that's not matching the example. because in the example, the order is -1, -11, 1, -12, 11.

let's compute the sums for each number in the input vector {1, 11, -1, -11, -12}:

1. 1: sum is 1 (positive, so add first digit 1, and no other digits).
2. 11: sum is 1 (from second digit) + 1 (first digit) = 2.
3. -1: sum is 0 (no digits beyond first) minus 1 → -1.
4. -11: sum is 1 (second digit) minus 1 (first digit) → 0.
5. -12: string is ""12"". j=1: sum += 2. then, since negative, subtract 1. so sum is 2 -1 = 1.

so the sums are:

1 → 1

11 → 2

-1 → -1

-11 → 0

-12 → 1

so the order based on sum should be from smallest to largest sum. so the order of sums is:

-1 (sum -1), 0 (sum 0), 1 (sum 1), 1 (sum 1), 2 (sum 2).

wait, but in the example, the output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, let's see the sums:

-1 has sum -1.

-11 has sum 0.

1 has sum 1.

-12 has sum 1.

11 has sum 2.

so the sorted order based on sum would be:

-1 (sum -1), then -11 (sum 0), then 1 (sum 1), then -12 (sum 1), then 11 (sum 2).

but wait, in the code, how is the sorting done? the code uses a bubble sort approach, comparing sumdigit[j-1] and sumdigit[j]. if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], swap both sumdigit and nums.

wait, the code's sorting loop is:

for (int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)
    for (int j=1;j<nums.size();j++)
        if (sumdigit[j-1]>sumdigit[j])
        {
            swap sumdigit[j-1] and sumdigit[j]
            swap nums[j-1] and nums[j]
        }

wait, that's not a correct implementation of bubble sort. because in bubble sort, for each i, you iterate j from 0 to n-i-1, but here i runs up to nums.size(), which is 5 in the example, and j runs from 1 to 5 each time. that might not correctly sort the array because it doesn't handle multiple passes properly.

wait, perhaps the code is incorrect in the way it sorts. let me think about how the code's sorting works.

the outer loop runs i from 0 to nums.size()-1 (assuming nums.size() is 5, i goes 0-4). the inner loop runs j from 1 to nums.size()-1 (1-4). for each j, it compares sumdigit[j-1] and sumdigit[j]. if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], swap them and the corresponding nums.

but this is not a standard bubble sort. in standard bubble sort, each pass i goes from 0 to n-2, and in each pass, j runs from 0 to n-i-2. the code here seems to have the outer loop as i from 0 to size-1, and inner j from 1 to size-1. so for each i, it's comparing adjacent elements, but perhaps not correctly.

wait, perhaps the code is incorrect because it's not correctly implementing a full bubble sort. for example, in the first pass (i=0), j runs from 1 to 4. so it will compare 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. if any are out of order, they are swapped. then, in the next i=1, j runs again from 1 to 4, which may not be necessary because the largest element has already bubbled to the end.

but perhaps the code is not correctly sorting the array, leading to incorrect order.

wait, but let's test with the example. let's see what the code does with the input {1, 11, -1, -11, -12}.

first, compute the sumdigit array.

compute each sum:

1: positive, sum is 1.

11: positive, sum is 1 + 1 = 2.

-1: negative, sum is -1.

-11: negative, sum is 1 (from second digit) minus 1 (first digit) → 0.

-12: negative, sum is 2 (second digit) minus 1 (first digit) → 1.

so sumdigit is [1, 2, -1, 0, 1].

now, the initial nums array is [1, 11, -1, -11, -12].

sumdigit is [1, 2, -1, 0, 1].

the code's sorting loops:

i runs from 0 to 4.

for each i, j runs from 1 to 4.

let's walk through each step.

i=0:

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=1 and sumdigit[1]=2. 1 < 2 → no swap.

j=2: compare sumdigit[1]=2 and sumdigit[2]=-1. 2 > -1 → swap.

after swap, sumdigit becomes [1, -1, 2, 0, 1].

nums becomes [1, -1, 11, -11, -12].

j=3: compare sumdigit[2]=2 and sumdigit[3]=0. 2>0 → swap.

sumdigit becomes [1, -1, 0, 2, 1].

nums becomes [1, -1, -11, 11, -12].

j=4: compare sumdigit[3]=2 and sumdigit[4]=1. 2>1 → swap.

sumdigit becomes [1, -1, 0, 1, 2].

nums becomes [1, -1, -11, -12, 11].

i=0 loop done.

i=1:

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=1 and sumdigit[1]=-1. 1 > -1 → swap.

sumdigit becomes [-1, 1, 0, 1, 2].

nums becomes [-1, 1, -11, -12, 11].

j=2: compare sumdigit[1]=1 and sumdigit[2]=0. 1>0 → swap.

sumdigit becomes [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2].

nums becomes [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11].

j=3: compare sumdigit[2]=1 and sumdigit[3]=1. equal → no swap.

j=4: compare sumdigit[3]=1 and sumdigit[4]=2. 1 < 2 → no swap.

i=1 done.

i=2:

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=-1 and sumdigit[1]=0. -1 < 0 → no swap.

j=2: compare sumdigit[1]=0 and sumdigit[2]=1. 0 <1 → no swap.

j=3: compare sumdigit[2]=1 and sumdigit[3]=1. equal → no swap.

j=4: compare sumdigit[3]=1 and sumdigit[4]=2. 1 <2 → no swap.

i=2 done.

i=3:

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=-1 and sumdigit[1]=0. no swap.

j=2: compare sumdigit[1]=0 and sumdigit[2]=1. no swap.

j=3: compare sumdigit[2]=1 and sumdigit[3]=1. no swap.

j=4: compare sumdigit[3]=1 and sumdigit[4]=2. no swap.

i=3 done.

i=4:

j=1: compare sumdigit[0]=-1 and sumdigit[1]=0. no swap.

j=2: compare sumdigit[1]=0 and sumdigit[2]=1. no swap.

j=3: compare sumdigit[2]=1 and sumdigit[3]=1. no swap.

j=4: compare sumdigit[3]=1 and sumdigit[4]=2. no swap.

i=4 done.

so the final nums array is [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11], which matches the expected output.

wait, but in the sumdigit after all swaps, the sumdigit array is [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2], which corresponds to the nums array [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11].

so the code seems to correctly sort the array in the example.

but wait, let's check another case. suppose two numbers have the same sum. for example, in the example, 1 and -12 both have sum 1. their original indices are 0 and 4. so in the sorted array, 1 comes before -12 because it has a lower index. which is correct.

another test case: empty vector. the function returns empty, which is correct.

what about a case where the sum is the same but the indices are different? let's say {2, 11}. both have sum 2 and 2 (2 is 2, 11 is 1+1=2). so in the original array, 2 is at index 0, 11 at 1. so the sorted array should be [2,11].

but according to the code, when the sums are equal, the original order is preserved because the code only swaps when sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j]. so if sumdigit[j-1] == sumdigit[j], no swap occurs, so the original order remains.

wait, but in the code, the sumdigit is being sorted in ascending order, and when two elements have the same sum, their relative order is maintained as per their original indices because the code doesn't swap them when sums are equal.

so the code should handle that correctly.

but wait, in the code, during the sorting, when two elements have the same sum, they are not swapped, so their order remains as per the original array. so the code should correctly maintain the original order for elements with the same sum.

so in the example, the code produces the correct output.

but wait, let me think again about the sum calculation for negative numbers. for example, -12: the code takes the absolute value, which is 12. the string is ""12"". j starts at 1, so the second character is '2', which is 2. then, since the number is negative, subtract the first digit (1). so sum is 2 -1 =1. that's correct.

another example: -123. the string is ""123"". j runs from 1 to 2: sum += 2 and 3. then subtract 1. so sum is 2+3 -1 =4.

wait, but the sum of digits for -123 is 1+2+3=6, but according to the code, it's treated as 2+3 -1 =4. so the code is not summing the digits correctly for negative numbers.

wait, that's a problem. because the problem statement says to sum the digits, but the code is subtracting the first digit for negative numbers. so for -123, the sum should be 1+2+3=6, but the code is computing 2+3 -1 =4.

wait, that's a bug. so the code is incorrectly calculating the sum for negative numbers.

wait, let me re-examine the code:

sum is initialized to 0.

for each j from 1 to w.length()-1 (since w is the string of absolute value), sum += w[j] -48.

then, if the number is positive, sum += w[0] -48.

if negative, sum -= w[0] -48.

so for a negative number, the first digit is subtracted, not added.

but the problem says to sum the digits, regardless of the sign. so for -123, the sum should be 1+2+3=6.

but according to the code, it's (2+3) -1 =4.

that's incorrect. so the code is wrong in how it calculates the sum for negative numbers.

wait, that would change the sum for negative numbers. so in the example given, the sum for -1 is -1, which is correct according to the code, but according to the problem statement, it should be 1.

wait, but in the example, the expected output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

but according to the correct sum calculation, the sums should be:

1: sum 1.

11: sum 2.

-1: sum 1.

-11: sum 2.

-12: sum 3 (1+2=3).

wait, that's different from what the code computes.

wait, this is a problem. because the code is not correctly calculating the sum of digits for negative numbers. it's subtracting the first digit instead of adding.

so the code is incorrect, which would cause the assertion to fail.

wait, but in the example, the code's sum for -1 is -1, which makes it the smallest, so it comes first. but according to the problem statement, the sum should be 1, which would make -1 have a sum of 1, same as 1. so in that case, the order would be different.

so the code is incorrect because it's miscalculating the sum for negative numbers.

so in the example, the code produces the correct output, but only because the sum calculation is wrong, leading to the same relative order as the correct sum.

wait, let's recompute the sums correctly for the example.

the example input is {1, 11, -1, -11, -12}.

correct sum calculation:

1 → 1.

11 → 1+1=2.

-1 → 1.

-11 → 1+1=2.

-12 → 1+2=3.

so the sums are [1, 2, 1, 2, 3].

the correct sorted order based on sum and original index:

the sums in order are 1 (index 0), 1 (index 2), 2 (index 1), 2 (index3), 3 (index4).

so the sorted array should be [1, -1, 11, -11, -12].

but the code's sum calculation for the example is:

sumdigit = [1, 2, -1, 0, 1].

which leads to the sorted array [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11].

so the code's output is different from what it should be according to"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46}) , {0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}));",unknown,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do and then analyze the code to see if it behaves correctly.

the function is called order_by_points and takes a vector of integers as input. it's supposed to sort the vector in ascending order based on the sum of their digits. if two numbers have the same sum, they should be ordered based on their original index in the vector.

looking at the example given: order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) should return {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}. let's break this down.

for each number, we calculate the sum of their digits. but wait, the function seems to handle negative numbers differently. let me check the code.

in the code, for each number in nums, it converts the absolute value to a string. then, it sums the digits. but here's the thing: for positive numbers, it adds the first digit (w[0] - 48), but for negative numbers, it subtracts that digit. wait, that's interesting. so for a negative number, the first digit is subtracted from the sum, while for positive, it's added.

wait, let me see. for example, take -1. the absolute value is 1, so w is ""1"". then, since nums[i] is negative, sum is subtracted by w[0]-48, which is 1-48? wait, wait, no. wait, the code says:

if (nums[i] > 0) sum += w[0] -48; else sum -= w[0] -48;

wait, that's not correct. because for a negative number, the first digit is part of the number, but the code is subtracting it. let me think: for example, take -123. the absolute value is 123, so w is ""123"". then, since it's negative, sum is (sum of 2 and 3) minus 1. so sum is 5 -1 =4.

wait, but the sum of digits for -123 should be 1+2+3=6, but according to the code, it's 2+3 -1 =4. that's different. so the code is treating the first digit differently for negatives. hmm, that's a problem because the sum of digits for a negative number should be the same as its absolute value. so this might be a bug.

wait, but in the example given, let's see:

the input is {1, 11, -1, -11, -12}.

let's compute the sum for each:

1: positive, sum is 1.

11: 1+1=2.

-1: absolute is 1. since it's negative, sum is 0 (since j starts from 1, but w.length() is 1, so the inner loop doesn't run. then, sum is 0, and since it's negative, subtract w[0]-48 (which is 1). so sum is -1.

wait, that can't be right. because the sum of digits for -1 is 1, but according to the code, it's -1. that's a problem.

wait, let me re-examine the code.

the code initializes sum to 0. then, for each character in the string starting from index 1 (j=1), it adds w[j]-48. then, if the number is positive, it adds w[0]-48, else subtracts it.

so for a single-digit negative number like -1:

w is ""1"". the loop runs from j=1 to w.length()-1, which is 0 times. so sum remains 0. then, since the number is negative, sum -= (1 -48) → 0 - (-47) → sum becomes 47? wait, wait, wait. wait, w[0] is '1', so w[0]-48 is 1. so for a negative number, sum is 0 - 1 = -1.

wait, that's not correct. the sum of digits for -1 should be 1, but the code is calculating it as -1. that's a bug.

so in the example, the order is based on these sums. let's see:

the example input is {1, 11, -1, -11, -12}.

compute sum for each:

1: positive. sum is 1.

11: 1+1=2.

-1: sum is 0 (from j=1, which doesn't run) minus 1 → -1.

-11: absolute is 11. j runs from 1 to 1 (since length is 2). so j=1: w[1] is '1' → 1. sum is 1. then, since it's negative, subtract w[0]-48 (1) → sum is 0.

-12: absolute is 12. j runs from 1: '2' → 2. sum is 2. then subtract 1 → sum is 1.

so the sums are:

1 → 1

11 → 2

-1 → -1

-11 → 0

-12 → 1

so the order based on sum (ascending) would be:

-1 (sum -1), then -11 (sum 0), then 1 (sum 1), then -12 (sum 1), then 11 (sum 2).

but wait, the original example expects {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, but according to the sums, 1 and -12 both have sum 1. so their order should be based on their original indices. in the input, 1 is at index 0, -12 is at index 4. so 1 comes before -12.

so the sorted order is correct as per the example.

but wait, according to the code's calculation, the sum for -1 is -1, which is the smallest, so it comes first. then -11 with sum 0, then 1 (sum 1), then -12 (sum 1), and 11 (sum 2). so the example's expected output is correct.

but wait, the code's calculation of the sum is incorrect for negative numbers. because for -1, the sum should be 1, not -1. so the code is not correctly calculating the sum of digits for negative numbers.

so this is a bug in the code. let's see how this affects the assertion.

now, looking at the assertion:

the input is {1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46}.

we need to compute the sum for each number as per the code's logic, then sort based on that sum, and if sums are equal, based on the original index.

but because the code incorrectly handles negative numbers, but in this assertion, all numbers are positive except 0. so maybe the bug doesn't affect this particular case. wait, 0 is in the input. let's see how the code handles 0.

for 0: the absolute value is 0, so w is ""0"". the loop runs from j=1, but since length is 1, it doesn't run. sum is 0. since 0 is not greater than 0, the else clause is taken: sum -= w[0]-48 → 0 - (0-48) → 0 - (-48) → 48.

wait, that's a problem. because the sum of digits for 0 should be 0, but according to the code, it's 48.

wait, let's see:

for 0, nums[i] is 0. so the code does:

string w = to_string(abs(0)) → ""0"".

sum is initialized to 0.

loop j from 1 to w.length()-1 → j runs from 1 to 0, so no iterations.

then, since nums[i] is 0, which is not >0, so else clause: sum -= w[0]-48.

w[0] is '0' → 0-48 = -48. so sum = 0 - (-48) = 48.

so the sum for 0 is 48, which is incorrect. it should be 0.

this will affect the sorting because 0's sum is 48, which is higher than other numbers. so in the assertion, 0 is placed near the end, but according to the code, it's sum is 48, which would place it after numbers with lower sums.

wait, the expected output in the assertion is {0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}.

wait, 0 is the first element in the expected output. but according to the code, 0's sum is 48, which is higher than many other numbers. so in the sorted list, 0 would come after numbers with lower sums.

so the assertion expects 0 to be first, but according to the code, it's sum is 48, which would place it much later. so this would cause the assertion to fail.

wait, but let me compute the sums for all the numbers in the assertion's input.

let me list each number and compute their sum as per the code.

input vector: {1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46}.

compute sum for each:

1. 1234: positive.

w = ""1234"".

sum starts at 0.

loop j from 1 to 3:

j=1: '2' → 2 → sum=2.

j=2: '3' →3 → sum=5.

j=3: '4' →4 → sum=9.

then, since positive, add w[0]-48 →1 → sum=10.

so sum is 10.

2. 423: positive.

w=""423"".

j=1: '2' →2 → sum=2.

j=2: '3' →3 → sum=5.

add w[0] '4' →4 → sum=9.

3. 463: positive.

w=""463"".

j=1: '6' →6 → sum=6.

j=2: '3' →3 → sum=9.

add w[0] '4' →4 → sum=13.

4. 145: positive.

w=""145"".

j=1: '4' →4 → sum=4.

j=2: '5' →5 → sum=9.

add w[0] '1' →1 → sum=10.

5. 2: positive.

w=""2"".

no loop (j starts at 1, length is 1).

add w[0] →2 → sum=2.

6. 423: same as 2nd element. sum=9.

7. 423: same as 2nd element. sum=9.

8. 53: positive.

w=""53"".

j=1: '3' →3 → sum=3.

add w[0] '5' →5 → sum=8.

9. 6: positive.

w=""6"".

no loop. add 6 → sum=6.

10. 37: positive.

w=""37"".

j=1: '7' →7 → sum=7.

add w[0] '3' →3 → sum=10.

11. 3457: positive.

w=""3457"".

j=1: '4' →4 → sum=4.

j=2: '5' →5 → sum=9.

j=3: '7' →7 → sum=16.

add w[0] '3' →3 → sum=19.

12. 3: positive.

w=""3"".

no loop. add 3 → sum=3.

13. 56: positive.

w=""56"".

j=1: '6' →6 → sum=6.

add w[0] '5' →5 → sum=11.

14. 0: as discussed, sum is 48.

15. 46: positive.

w=""46"".

j=1: '6' →6 → sum=6.

add w[0] '4' →4 → sum=10.

now, let's list each number with their index and sum:

index: 0 →1234 → sum 10.

1 →423 →9.

2 →463 →13.

3 →145 →10.

4 →2 →2.

5 →423 →9.

6 →423 →9.

7 →53 →8.

8 →6 →6.

9 →37 →10.

10 →3457 →19.

11 →3 →3.

12 →56 →11.

13 →0 →48.

14 →46 →10.

now, the task is to sort the numbers based on their sum in ascending order. if sums are equal, the original index determines the order.

so let's list all the sums and their indices:

numbers and their sum:

0:1234 →10.

1:423 →9.

2:463 →13.

3:145 →10.

4:2 →2.

5:423 →9.

6:423 →9.

7:53 →8.

8:6 →6.

9:37 →10.

10:3457 →19.

11:3 →3.

12:56 →11.

13:0 →48.

14:46 →10.

now, let's create a list of tuples (sum, original index, number):

(10, 0, 1234)

(9,1,423)

(13,2,463)

(10,3,145)

(2,4,2)

(9,5,423)

(9,6,423)

(8,7,53)

(6,8,6)

(10,9,37)

(19,10,3457)

(3,11,3)

(11,12,56)

(48,13,0)

(10,14,46)

now, we need to sort these tuples first by sum, then by original index.

so the order of sums from smallest to largest:

2,3,6,8,9,9,9,10,10,10,10,11,13,19,48.

now, let's list the numbers in order.

sum=2: index4 →2.

sum=3: index11 →3.

sum=6: index8 →6.

sum=8: index7 →53.

sum=9: indices1,5,6 →423,423,423.

sum=10: indices0,3,9,14 →1234,145,37,46.

sum=11: index12 →56.

sum=13: index2 →463.

sum=19: index10 →3457.

sum=48: index13 →0.

so the sorted order should be:

2,3,6,53,423,423,423,1234,145,37,46,56,463,3457,0.

wait, but wait: the sum=10 group includes indices 0,3,9,14. so their order is based on their original indices.

so the order within sum=10 is 0 (1234), 3 (145),9 (37),14 (46).

so the sorted list is:

2 (index4), 3 (11),6 (8),53 (7),423 (1),423 (5),423 (6),1234 (0),145 (3),37 (9),46 (14),56 (12),463 (2),3457 (10),0 (13).

so the resulting vector is:

[2,3,6,53,423,423,423,1234,145,37,46,56,463,3457,0]

but the assertion expects:

{0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}

wait, that's different. the expected output starts with 0, but according to the code's sum calculation, 0 has a sum of 48, which is the largest, so it should come last.

so the expected output in the assertion is incorrect according to the code's logic. or perhaps the code is incorrect.

wait, but the code's handling of 0 is wrong. because the sum should be 0, but the code calculates it as 48. so in the code, 0 is placed at the end, but the assertion expects it to be first.

so in the assertion, the expected output is [0,2,3,...], but according to the code's calculation, 0 is last. so the assertion would fail.

but wait, perhaps i made a mistake in the code's sum calculation for 0.

let me re-examine the code for 0:

nums[i] is 0.

w = to_string(abs(0)) → ""0"".

sum is initialized to 0.

loop j from 1 to w.length()-1 → j runs from 1 to 0, which doesn't execute.

then, since nums[i] is not >0, else clause: sum -= (w[0] -48).

w[0] is '0' → 0-48 = -48.

sum = 0 - (-48) = 48.

yes, that's correct.

so according to the code, 0's sum is 48, which is higher than all others, so it's placed last.

but the assertion expects 0 to be first. so the assertion's expected output is incorrect, meaning the code would not produce that output, so the assertion would fail.

wait, but perhaps the code is incorrect, and the sum for 0 should be 0. so the code has a bug.

alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but the assertion is wrong.

wait, the problem statement says that the sum is the sum of their digits. so for 0, the sum is 0.

so the code is incorrect in calculating the sum for 0 as 48.

so the code has a bug. therefore, the function would not sort the numbers correctly, especially when 0 is present.

so in the assertion, the expected output is wrong according to the code's logic, but the code's logic is incorrect.

wait, but the assertion is testing whether the function returns the expected output. so if the function is incorrect, the assertion would fail.

so, in this case, the function's code is incorrect, leading to the assertion failing.

but wait, perhaps i should re-examine the code's sorting algorithm.

the code uses a nested loop for sorting, which is a bubble sort approach. it iterates from i=0 to size-1, and for each i, j starts from 1. if sumdigit[j-1]"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({}) , {}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. the function in question is order_by_points, which is supposed to sort a vector of integers based on the sum of their digits. if two numbers have the same sum, they should be ordered based on their original indices.

the specific assertion is checking if order_by_points called with an empty vector returns an empty vector. so, the assertion is assert(issame(order_by_points({}) , {}));. i'm assuming that 'issame' is a function that checks if two vectors are identical.

first, i'll look at the code of the function. let's go through it step by step.

the function starts by initializing a vector sumdigit. then, it loops through each element in the input vector nums. for each number, it converts the absolute value to a string. then, it calculates the sum of the digits. 

wait, looking at the loop inside, for each character in the string starting from index 1 (j=1), it adds the digit value (w[j]-48) to sum. then, if the original number was positive, it adds the first digit (w[0]-48) to sum. if it was negative, it subtracts that value. hmm, that's interesting. so for negative numbers, the first digit is subtracted, while for positive, it's added.

wait, but the sum is supposed to be the sum of the digits. so for example, for -12, the digits are 1 and 2. the sum should be 1 + 2 = 3. but according to the code, for a negative number, it's subtracting the first digit. so for -12, the code would do sum = 0, then add w[1] -48 (which is 2), then since the number is negative, subtract w[0]-48 (1). so sum would be 2 -1 = 1. that's not correct because the sum of digits for -12 should be 1+2=3, but the code is calculating it as 1.

wait, that's a problem. so the code is incorrectly calculating the sum of digits for negative numbers. it's treating the first digit as negative, which is wrong because the sum of digits should be the sum of the absolute values of each digit. so for -12, the sum should be 1 + 2 = 3, but the code is calculating 2 -1 = 1. that's a bug.

but wait, the assertion in question is about an empty vector. so maybe the function's handling of empty vectors is correct, but other cases are wrong. let's focus on the empty vector case.

looking at the function, when nums is empty, the for loop (int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++) won't execute at all. so sumdigit remains empty. then, the next part is a nested for loop for sorting. since nums.size() is 0, the outer loop (i from 0 to nums.size()-1) won't run. so the function returns nums, which is empty.

so for the input {}, the function returns {}, which matches the expected output. therefore, the assertion should pass.

but wait, what about the code's handling of the sumdigit and the sorting? since the vector is empty, those parts are irrelevant. so the function correctly returns an empty vector.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly returns an empty vector when given an empty input, so the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3}) , {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}));",unknown,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails when using the provided c++ function. let's break this down step by step.

first, i'll look at the function `order_by_points`. it's supposed to sort a vector of integers based on the sum of their digits. if two numbers have the same sum, they should be ordered based on their original indices.

let me understand how the function works.

the function starts by creating a vector `sumdigit` to store the sum of digits for each number in the input vector `nums`. for each number, it converts the absolute value to a string. then, it calculates the sum by iterating through each character of the string, subtracting 48 to get the integer value of each digit.

wait, there's something here. for positive numbers, it adds the first digit (w[0]) to the sum. for negative numbers, it subtracts the first digit. wait, that doesn't seem right. because the sum of digits should be the sum of all digits, regardless of the sign. for example, -11 has digits 1 and 1, sum is 2. but according to the code, for negative numbers, it's subtracting the first digit. so for -11, the sum would be (1) subtracted, then add the next digits. wait, let me see:

the code does:
sum = 0;
for j from 1 to w.length()-1:
    sum += w[j] -48;
if the number is positive, add w[0]-48 to sum.
if negative, subtract w[0]-48.

wait, that's not correct. because for a negative number, the digits are the same as the absolute value. so for -123, the digits are 1,2,3, sum is 6. but according to the code, for negative numbers, it's subtracting the first digit. so for -123, sum would be (2+3) -1 =4. that's wrong.

so the function is incorrectly calculating the sum of digits for negative numbers. that's a bug.

wait, let me think again. the code converts the number to its absolute value as a string. so for -11, the string is ""11"". then, for j starting from 1, it adds w[1]-48, which is 1. then, since the original number is negative, it subtracts w[0]-48, which is 1. so sum is 1 -1 = 0. but the correct sum should be 1+1=2.

so the code is miscalculating the sum for negative numbers. that's a problem.

wait, but looking at the example given in the problem statement:

order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) should return {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

let's compute the sum for each:

1: sum is 1.

11: 1+1=2.

-1: sum is 1 (digits are 1). but according to the code, since it's negative, it would subtract 1. so sum would be 0.

wait, but in the example, -1 comes first. so according to the code, the sum for -1 is 0, which is less than 1's sum of 1. so that's correct. but wait, what about -11? the code would calculate sum as (1) -1 =0. so -11's sum is 0, same as -1. but in the example, -11 comes after -1. so the code's sorting would have them ordered by their original indices. so that's correct.

wait, but the code's sum calculation is wrong for negative numbers. so perhaps the function is not working as intended.

wait, but let's proceed. the function then sorts the vector based on the sumdigit array. it uses a bubble sort approach, swapping elements if the previous sum is larger than the next. so it's sorting in ascending order of sum.

now, the assertion is:

order_by_points({1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3}) should equal {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}.

let me compute the sum for each number in the input vector.

input vector: [1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3]

compute sum of digits correctly (ignoring the code's mistake for a moment):

1: sum is 1.

-11: digits are 1 and 1, sum is 2.

-32: digits 3 and 2, sum 5.

43: 4+3=7.

54:5+4=9.

-98:9+8=17.

2: sum 2.

-3: sum 3.

wait, but according to the code's calculation, the sums would be different for negatives.

let me compute the sum as per the code:

for each number:

1: positive. sum is 1.

-11: string is ""11"". j starts at 1, adds 1. then subtracts 1 (since negative). sum is 0.

-32: string ""32"". j=1: 2. then subtract 3. sum is 2-3 = -1.

43: positive. sum 4+3=7.

54: 5+4=9.

-98: string ""98"". j=1:8. subtract 9. sum is 8-9 = -1.

2: positive. sum 2.

-3: string ""3"". j starts at 1, but length is 1, so loop doesn't run. then subtract 3. sum is -3.

wait, so the sumdigit array according to the code would be:

1: sum 1.

-11: sum 0.

-32: sum -1.

43:7.

54:9.

-98: sum -1.

2:2.

-3: sum -3.

so the sumdigit array is [1, 0, -1,7,9,-1,2,-3].

wait, let me list them in order of the input vector:

indices 0 to 7:

0:1 → sum 1.

1:-11 → sum 0.

2:-32 → sum -1.

3:43 →7.

4:54→9.

5:-98→-1.

6:2→2.

7:-3→-3.

so sumdigit is [1,0,-1,7,9,-1,2,-3].

now, the function sorts the nums vector based on sumdigit, in ascending order. so the order is determined by the sumdigit values. if two sums are equal, the original index determines the order.

so let's list each number with its sum and index:

index 0: sum 1.

index1: sum0.

index2: sum-1.

index3:7.

index4:9.

index5:-1.

index6:2.

index7:-3.

we need to sort them in ascending order of sum, then by index.

so the order of sums from smallest to largest:

-3 (index7), -1 (index2), -1 (index5), 0 (index1), 1 (index0), 2 (index6),7 (index3),9 (index4).

so the sorted order should be:

-3 (sum-3), then index2 (-32, sum-1), then index5 (-98, sum-1), then index1 (-11, sum0), then index0 (1, sum1), then index6 (2, sum2), then index3 (43, sum7), then index4 (54, sum9).

so the expected output is: {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2,43,54}.

which matches the assertion.

but wait, the code's sum calculation is incorrect. because for negative numbers, the code subtracts the first digit instead of adding. so for -32, the correct sum is 3+2=5, but the code calculates it as 2-3=-1.

so the code's sumdigit is incorrect. but in the assertion, the expected output is based on the correct sum. so the function, as written, would not produce the expected output.

wait, but according to the code's sum calculation, the sumdigit is as i computed earlier. so the function would sort based on those sums.

but the assertion expects the order based on correct sums. so the function's output would not match the assertion.

wait, but let me see: according to the code's sumdigit, the order is:

sumdigit values: [1,0,-1,7,9,-1,2,-3].

so the sorted order based on sumdigit would be:

the smallest sum is -3 (index7), then -1 (index2 and 5), then 0 (index1), then 1 (index0), then 2 (index6), then7, then9.

so the order of the numbers would be:

index7 (-3), index2 (-32), index5 (-98), index1 (-11), index0 (1), index6 (2), index3 (43), index4 (54).

which is exactly the same as the assertion expects.

wait, but according to the code's sum calculation, the sum for -32 is -1, and for -98 is -1. so they come before -11 (sum0) and 1 (sum1).

so the function's output would be {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2,43,54}, which matches the assertion.

but wait, that's because the code's sum calculation is incorrect, but in this particular case, it's producing the same order as if the sum was correct.

wait, that's confusing. let me think again.

in the code, for negative numbers, the sum is calculated as (sum of digits except first) minus the first digit. so for -32, sum is 2 -3 = -1. for -98, 8-9=-1. for -11, 1-1=0. for -3, 0-3=-3.

in the correct sum, -32's sum is 5, -98's sum is17, etc. so the code's sum is way off.

but in the assertion, the expected order is based on the correct sum. so why does the function's output match the assertion?

because in the code's sum, the order of the sums happens to align with the correct order.

wait, let's see:

in the code's sum, the order is:

-3 (sum-3) → index7.

then, sum-1: index2 and 5.

sum0: index1.

sum1: index0.

sum2: index6.

sum7: index3.

sum9: index4.

so the function's sorted order is:

-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2,43,54.

which is exactly what the assertion expects.

but according to the correct sum, the order would be:

-3 (sum3), -11 (sum2), -32 (sum5), -98 (sum17), 1 (sum1), 2 (sum2),43 (sum7),54 (sum9).

wait, no. wait, the correct sum for each number is:

1 →1.

-11 →1+1=2.

-32→3+2=5.

43→4+3=7.

54→5+4=9.

-98→9+8=17.

2→2.

-3→3.

so the correct sum array is [1,2,5,7,9,17,2,3].

so the correct order based on sum and index would be:

looking for the smallest sum first.

the sums in order:

-3: sum3.

-11: sum2.

-32: sum5.

1: sum1.

2: sum2.

43: sum7.

54: sum9.

-98: sum17.

wait, no. wait, the correct sum for each number in the input vector is:

input vector: [1, -11, -32,43,54,-98,2,-3].

sum for each:

1 →1.

-11 →1+1=2.

-32→3+2=5.

43→7.

54→9.

-98→17.

2→2.

-3→3.

so the sum array is [1,2,5,7,9,17,2,3].

so when sorted by sum, the order is:

sum1 (1, index0), sum2 (-11, index1; 2, index6), sum3 (-3, index7), sum5 (-32, index2), sum7 (43, index3), sum9 (54, index4), sum17 (-98, index5).

wait, but wait: the sum for 1 is 1, which is the smallest. then comes sum2 for -11 (index1) and 2 (index6). since -11 comes before 2 in the original vector, it should come first. then sum3 for -3 (index7). then sum5 for -32 (index2). then sum7, etc.

so the correct order would be: 1, -11, 2, -3, -32,43,54,-98.

but the assertion expects {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2,43,54}.

which is different.

wait, so the function's output, based on its incorrect sum calculation, matches the assertion, but the correct output should be different.

so the function is incorrect, but in this particular test case, it's producing the expected output of the assertion.

wait, but why?

because in the code's sum calculation, the sums are:

1 →1.

-11→0.

-32→-1.

43→7.

54→9.

-98→-1.

2→2.

-3→-3.

so the sum array is [1,0,-1,7,9,-1,2,-3].

so when sorted, the order is:

-3 (index7), -1 (index2), -1 (index5), 0 (index1), 1 (index0), 2 (index6),7 (index3),9 (index4).

which corresponds to the numbers: -3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2,43,54.

which is exactly what the assertion expects.

so the function, despite having a bug in sum calculation, produces the correct output for this particular test case.

but wait, the function's sum calculation is incorrect. so why does it pass this test case?

because in this test case, the incorrect sum calculation leads to the same ordering as the correct sum would.

wait, no. because the correct sum would order the numbers differently.

wait, the correct sum would have:

1 comes first (sum1), then -11 (sum2), then 2 (sum2), then -3 (sum3), then -32 (sum5), then43 (sum7), then54 (sum9), then-98 (sum17).

but the function's sum calculation leads to a different order.

so the function's output is {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2,43,54}, which is what the assertion expects, but according to the correct sum, the order should be different.

wait, but the assertion is expecting the function to return {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2,43,54}.

which is exactly what the function returns, despite the sum calculation being wrong.

so the assertion would pass because the function's output matches the expected output.

but wait, the function is incorrect. it's just that in this particular case, the incorrect sum calculation leads to the same order as the correct one.

so the assertion would pass, but the function is still buggy.

wait, but perhaps i made a mistake in the sum calculation.

let me recheck the code's sum calculation for each number.

let's take each number in the input vector:

1: positive.

string is ""1"".

sum starts at 0.

j runs from 1 to length-1, which is 0, so loop doesn't run.

then, since positive, add w[0]-48 →1.

sum is 1.

-11: negative.

string is ""11"".

j runs from 1 to 1 (length is 2, j<2 → j=1).

sum += w[1]-48 →1.

then, since negative, subtract w[0]-48 →1.

sum is 1-1=0.

-32: negative.

string ""32"".

j=1: sum +=2.

subtract 3 → sum=2-3=-1.

43: positive.

""43"" → j=1: sum +=3. then add 4 → sum=7.

54: ""54"" → j=1:4. add5 →9.

-98: ""98"" → j=1:8. subtract9 →8-9=-1.

2: positive. sum is2.

-3: negative. string ""3"". j runs from1 to0 → no loop. subtract3 → sum=-3.

so sumdigit is [1,0,-1,7,9,-1,2,-3].

so when sorted, the order is as before.

so the function's output is as per the assertion.

thus, the assertion would pass.

but the function is incorrect because it's miscalculating the sum for negative numbers. however, in this specific test case, the incorrect calculation leads to the correct order.

so the assertion passes.

but wait, perhaps i'm missing something. let me think about another test case.

for example, the sample given in the problem statement:

order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) should return {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

let's compute the sumdigit according to the code.

1: sum1.

11: sum1+1=2.

-1: string ""1"". j doesn't run. subtract1 → sum-1.

-11: sum1-1=0.

-12: string ""12"". j=1:2. subtract1 →2-1=1.

so sumdigit is [1,2,-1,0,1].

sorting based on sumdigit:

-1 (sum-1, index2), 0 (index3), 1 (index0), 1 (index4), 2 (index1).

so the order is -1, -11, 1, -12, 11.

which matches the sample.

but according to correct sum:

1 →1.

11→2.

-1→1.

-11→2.

-12→3.

so correct sum array is [1,2,1,2,3].

so the correct order would be:

-1 (sum1"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}) , {1, 10, 2, 11, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given c++ function order_by_points correctly sorts the vector according to the sum of the digits of each integer. the assertion provided is checking if the function returns a specific order when given the input {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}. the expected output is {1,10,2,11,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

first, i'll analyze the function step by step.

the function starts by calculating the sum of the digits for each number in the input vector. it does this by converting each number to its absolute value string representation. then, it iterates through each character in the string, converting each to its integer value and summing them up. however, there's a part that handles positive and negative numbers differently. for positive numbers, it adds the first digit, but for negative numbers, it subtracts the first digit. wait, that doesn't seem right. because for a negative number like -1, the sum should be -1's digits sum, which is 1, but the function is subtracting the first digit. let me think: for example, if the number is -12, the string is ""12"". the code takes the first character '1' and subtracts 48, giving 1, then subtracts that from the sum. so for -12, the sum would be 2 (from the second digit) minus 1, which is 1. but wait, the sum of digits for -12 should be 1 + 2 = 3, but the function is treating it as 2 -1 =1. that's incorrect because the sign should not affect the sum of digits. the sum of digits is always the sum of the absolute values of each digit. so the function's approach is wrong here.

wait, looking back at the code: for each number, it converts to the absolute value string. so for -1, the string is ""1"". then, for positive numbers, it adds the first digit (w[0] -48) to the sum. for negative numbers, it subtracts the first digit. but wait, the number is negative, but the string is the absolute value, so the first digit is positive. so for a negative number, the code subtracts the first digit. that would make the sum incorrect. for example, -1 would have sum 0 (since j starts at 1, but the string is length 1, so the inner loop doesn't run. then, since the number is negative, it subtracts w[0]-48, which is 1. so sum is -1. but the correct sum should be 1.

so the function is incorrectly calculating the sum for negative numbers. that's a problem. so the sumdigit vector is not correctly computed for negative numbers.

but wait, in the example given in the problem statement, the function returns {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11} for the input {1,11,-1,-11,-12}. let's compute the sum for each:

1: sum is 1.

11: 1+1=2.

-1: sum is 1 (but according to the function, it's -1, which is wrong).

wait, but in the example, the output is ordered as {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}. let's compute the correct sum:

-1: sum is 1.

-11: 1+1=2.

1: sum is 1.

-12: 1+2=3.

11: 1+1=2.

so the correct order based on sum would be: the numbers with sum 1 come first, then sum 2, then sum 3.

looking at the input order:

indices 0:1 (sum1), 1:11 (sum2), 2:-1 (sum1), 3:-11 (sum2), 4:-12 (sum3).

so the correct order should be the numbers with sum1 first, ordered by their original indices. so index 0 (1) comes before index2 (-1). then sum2: index1 (11) and index3 (-11). then sum3: index4 (-12).

so the correct sorted order is 1, -1, 11, -11, -12.

but according to the example, the function returns {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}, which is different. wait, that suggests that the function's sum calculation is incorrect, but perhaps the example is correct. hmm, maybe i'm misunderstanding the example.

wait, the example says order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) returns {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, let's compute the sum for each number as per the function:

1: positive, sum is 1.

11: positive, sum is 1+1=2.

-1: negative, sum is 0 (from inner loop, j starts at 1, but string is length 1, so no addition. then subtract w[0]-48 (1) → sum is -1.

-11: negative, string is ""11"". inner loop runs for j=1, adds 1. then subtracts 1 (w[0]-48) → sum is 1 -1 = 0.

-12: string is ""12"". inner loop j=1: adds 2. then subtracts 1 → sum is 2-1=1.

so the sumdigit array would be [1, 2, -1, 0, 1].

now, the function sorts based on sumdigit. so the order after sorting would be based on the sumdigit values.

looking at the sumdigit array:

indices 0:1, 1:2, 2:-1, 3:0, 4:1.

so the order from smallest to largest sum is:

-1 (index2), 0 (index3), 1 (index0), 1 (index4), 2 (index1).

so the sorted order of the original numbers would be:

nums[2] (-1), nums[3] (-11), nums[0] (1), nums[4] (-12), nums[1] (11).

which matches the example's output: {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

so the function's sum calculation is incorrect for negative numbers, but in this example, it produces the correct output as per the problem statement. wait, that's confusing. because according to the correct sum, -1's sum is 1, but the function calculates it as -1. so why does the example's output have -1 come first?

ah, because the function's sumdigit is [-1, 2, -1, 0, 1]. so when sorted, the order is based on these sums. so the function's logic is flawed, but in the example, it produces the correct output. but perhaps the function is not correctly handling the sum for negative numbers.

but regardless, the function's sum calculation is incorrect for negative numbers. so when the function is applied to the assertion's input, it may produce incorrect results.

now, the assertion is:

order_by_points({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}) should return {1,10,2,11,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

let's compute the sum for each number in the input as per the function's logic.

the input is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11].

compute sumdigit for each:

1: positive. sum is 1.

2: 2.

3:3.

4:4.

5:5.

6:6.

7:7.

8:8.

9:9.

10: positive. string is ""10"". j starts at 1: adds 0. then adds 1 (w[0]-48). sum is 0+1=1.

11: positive. string is ""11"". j=1: adds 1. then adds 1. sum is 2.

so sumdigit array is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2].

now, the function sorts the numbers based on sumdigit, and for equal sums, based on original index.

so the sumdigit array is:

index 0:1

1:2

2:3

3:4

4:5

5:6

6:7

7:8

8:9

9:1

10:2.

we need to sort the numbers in ascending order of sumdigit, and for same sum, order by index.

so the sorted order of sumdigit is:

sum=1: indices 0 and 9.

sum=2: indices 1 and 10.

sum=3: index2.

sum=4: index3.

sum=5: index4.

sum=6: index5.

sum=7: index6.

sum=8: index7.

sum=9: index8.

so the order of the numbers should be:

nums[0] (1), nums[9] (10), nums[1] (2), nums[10] (11), nums[2] (3), nums[3] (4), nums[4] (5), nums[5] (6), nums[6] (7), nums[7] (8), nums[8] (9).

which is exactly the expected output in the assertion: {1,10,2,11,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.

but wait, the function's sum calculation for 10 is 1, which is correct. for 11, sum is 2, correct.

so according to the function's logic, the sumdigit array is correct for this case, and the sorting should produce the expected output.

but wait, earlier i thought the function's sum calculation for negative numbers is wrong. but in this assertion, all numbers are positive, so the function's sum calculation is correct.

so the function should pass this assertion.

wait, but let me double-check the function's sorting algorithm.

the function uses a nested loop that seems to implement a bubble sort. it iterates i from 0 to size-1, and for each i, j from 1 to size-1. for each j, if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], it swaps sumdigit and nums elements.

wait, that's not the standard bubble sort. because in each i iteration, it's comparing j-1 and j, but the outer loop runs for i from 0 to size-1, which is correct for bubble sort. however, the inner loop runs j from 1 to size, which may not be the best, but it's acceptable.

but the problem is that the function is sorting in ascending order, which is correct.

so for the given assertion, the function should return the correct order.

wait, but let me think about the sumdigit for 10. the function correctly sums 1+0=1. so yes.

so the function should pass the assertion.

but wait, in the function, the sum for 10 is 1, and for 1 is 1. so in the sumdigit array, index 0 and 9 have sum 1. so during sorting, since index 0 comes before index9, the order is 1, then 10.

yes, which is correct.

so the function should pass the assertion.

but wait, earlier i thought the function's sum calculation for negative numbers is wrong, but in this case, all numbers are positive, so it's correct.

so the assertion should pass.

but wait, let me think again. the function's sum calculation for negative numbers is incorrect, but in the given assertion, all numbers are positive, so the sum is correct. so the function should return the expected output.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly calculates the sum of digits for positive numbers. in the given assertion, all numbers are positive, so the sumdigit array is accurate. the sorting logic correctly orders the numbers based on their sum of digits and original indices. thus, the function returns the expected output, and the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({0,6,6,-76,-21,23,4}) , {-76, -21, 0, 4, 23, 6, 6}));",unknown,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c++ code. the function in question is order_by_points, which sorts a vector of integers based on the sum of their digits. if two numbers have the same sum, they should be ordered based on their original indices.

let me first understand what the function does step by step.

the function starts by creating a vector called sumdigit to store the sum of the digits for each number in the input vector nums. it then iterates over each number in nums.

for each number, it converts the absolute value of the number to a string. then, it calculates the sum of the digits. the way it's done is a bit tricky. it starts with j=1, so it skips the first character (which is the first digit) and adds the rest. then, if the original number was positive, it adds the first digit; if negative, it subtracts the first digit. wait, that doesn't seem right. let me think: for a positive number, the first digit is part of the sum, so adding it makes sense. for a negative number, the first digit is part of the absolute value, but since the number is negative, perhaps the sum is being treated differently. wait, no. the sum of digits should be the sum of all digits regardless of the sign. so for example, -123 has digits 1,2,3, sum 6. but in the code, for a negative number, it subtracts the first digit. that would make the sum negative for the first digit, which is incorrect.

wait, let's look at the code again. for a negative number, the code does sum -= w[0] - 48. so for example, if the number is -12, the absolute value is 12, so w is ""12"". then, j starts at 1, so it adds '2' (w[1] -48 is 2). then, since the number is negative, it subtracts w[0] -48, which is 1. so sum is 2 -1 =1. but the correct sum of digits for -12 is 1+2=3. so the code is calculating it as 1, which is wrong. that's a problem.

wait, that's a mistake in the code. the sum of digits should be the sum of all digits, regardless of the sign. so for negative numbers, the code is subtracting the first digit instead of adding. that's incorrect.

so for example, in the sample input {1, 11, -1, -11, -12}, the sum for -1 should be 1, but according to the code, it's 0. let me see:

for -1, the absolute value is 1, so w is ""1"". the loop for j starts at 1, but since w.length() is 1, the inner loop doesn't run, so sum remains 0. then, since the number is negative, sum -= w[0]-48, which is 1. so sum is -1. that's wrong. the correct sum should be 1.

wait, that's a big issue. so the code is incorrectly calculating the sum for negative numbers. so the function is flawed.

but wait, let's see the sample given in the problem statement. the sample input is {1, 11, -1, -11, -12}, and the expected output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}. let's compute the sum for each number correctly:

1: sum is 1.

11: 1+1=2.

-1: sum is 1.

-11: 1+1=2.

-12: 1+2=3.

so the correct order based on sum would be:

-1 (sum 1), -11 (sum 2), 1 (sum 1), but wait, no. wait, the order is based on the sum, and for same sums, the original index.

wait, the original vector is [1, 11, -1, -11, -12]. so their indices are 0,1,2,3,4.

sum for each:

1: 1.

11: 2.

-1: 1.

-11: 2.

-12: 3.

so the order should be sorted by sum, then index.

so the sums are:

1 (index 0), 2 (index1), 1 (index2), 2 (index3), 3 (index4).

so the order based on sum:

the smallest sum is 1, which occurs at index 0 and 2. so the order between them is based on their indices. so index 0 comes before 2.

wait no, wait: the sum for 1 is 1, and for -1 is 1. so in the original vector, 1 is at index 0, -1 at index 2. so when sorted, the order should be 1 (index0) comes before -1 (index2) because their sums are same but 0 <2.

wait, but the sample output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}. let's see:

-1 is at index2, sum 1.

-11 is at index3, sum 2.

1 is at index0, sum1.

wait, that's not correct. because 1 (sum1, index0) should come before -1 (sum1, index2). so the sample output seems incorrect, but according to the problem statement, the sample output is {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, perhaps i'm misunderstanding the sample. let me recheck.

wait, the sample says:

order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) == {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}

wait, let's compute the sum for each:

1: sum is 1.

11: 1+1=2.

-1: sum is 1.

-11: 1+1=2.

-12: 1+2=3.

so the sums are [1,2,1,2,3].

so the order should be sorted by sum, then index.

so the elements with sum 1 are 1 (index0) and -1 (index2). so in the sorted list, 1 comes before -1.

but the sample output starts with -1, which is index2. so that's conflicting.

wait, perhaps the code is incorrect, which would explain why the sample assertion may fail.

but perhaps i'm missing something. let me think again.

wait, perhaps the code is correct, but i'm misunderstanding how the sum is calculated.

wait, looking back at the code:

for each number, it converts to string of absolute value.

then, for j from 1 to w.length()-1, it adds w[j] -48.

then, if the number is positive, it adds w[0]-48; else, subtracts.

wait, that's wrong. because for a negative number, the sum should include all digits, including the first one, as positive.

so for -1, the sum should be 1. but according to the code:

w is ""1"", j starts at 1, which is beyond the string length (length is 1), so the inner loop doesn't run. sum remains 0.

then, since the number is negative, sum -= w[0]-48 → 0 -1 = -1.

so the sum is -1, which is incorrect.

so the code is incorrectly calculating the sum for negative numbers.

that's a problem. so the function is flawed.

so when the function is given the sample input, it's not producing the correct output.

but according to the problem statement, the sample expects {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}.

wait, perhaps the code is correct, but i'm misunderstanding the sum calculation.

wait, perhaps the code is correct, but the way the sum is computed is different.

wait, perhaps the code is adding the digits correctly for negative numbers.

wait, let's take -1 as an example.

in the code:

w is ""1"".

sum starts at 0.

j starts at 1, but since w.length() is 1, the loop doesn't run.

then, since nums[i] is negative (nums[i] is -1), sum -= w[0]-48 → sum = 0 -1 = -1.

so sumdigit for -1 is -1.

but the correct sum should be 1.

so the code is wrong.

similarly, for -11:

w is ""11"".

j runs from 1 to 2 (since length is 2).

sum starts at 0.

j=1: w[1] is '1' → 1. sum becomes 1.

then, since nums[i] is negative, sum -= w[0]-48 → 1 -1 =0.

so sum is 0.

but correct sum is 1+1=2.

so the code is incorrect.

so the function is not correctly calculating the sum of digits for negative numbers.

this means that the function's sorting is based on incorrect sums, leading to incorrect ordering.

now, the assertion given is:

assert (issame(order_by_points({0,6,6,-76,-21,23,4}) , {-76, -21, 0, 4, 23, 6, 6}));

let's compute what the function would do for this input.

first, let's list the numbers and their indices:

index 0: 0

index 1:6

index2:6

index3:-76

index4:-21

index5:23

index6:4

compute the sumdigit for each using the code:

for each number, compute sum as per code.

let's go step by step.

number 0 (index0):

w = ""0""

sum starts at 0.

j runs from 1 to 1 (since length is 1). so no loop.

since number is positive (0 is considered positive?), sum += w[0]-48 → 0 + (0-48)= -48? wait, wait, wait. wait, 0 is non-negative, so the code adds w[0]-48.

wait, but 0 is a single digit. so for 0, the code will compute sum as 0 (from the loop, which doesn't run) plus w[0]-48, which is 0-48= -48. so sum is -48.

but the correct sum is 0.

so that's another mistake.

wait, that's a problem. so for 0, the sum is being calculated as -48, which is wrong.

wait, let's compute each number's sum as per the code.

1. 0 (index0):

w = ""0""

sum = 0.

j runs from 1 to 1 → no iteration.

since number is 0 (positive?), sum += w[0]-48 → 0 + (0-48) = -48.

sumdigit[0] = -48.

2. 6 (index1):

w = ""6""

sum =0.

j runs from 1 to 1 → no iteration.

sum += 6-48 → 6-48= -42.

sumdigit[1] = -42.

3. 6 (index2):

same as index1: sum is -42.

sumdigit[2] = -42.

4. -76 (index3):

w = ""76"".

sum starts at 0.

j runs from 1 to 2:

j=1: w[1] is '6' → 6-48=6? wait, no: 6 is the character, so '6' -48 is 6.

sum +=6 → sum=6.

then, since number is negative, sum -= w[0]-48 → 7-48= -41. so sum =6 -41= -35.

sumdigit[3] = -35.

5. -21 (index4):

w = ""21"".

sum starts at 0.

j runs from 1 to 2:

j=1: '1' → 1-48=1? no, wait: '1' is 49 in ascii. 49-48=1.

sum +=1 → sum=1.

then, since number is negative, sum -= w[0]-48 → 2-48= -46. so sum =1 - (-46) → 1 +46=47? wait, wait:

wait, sum is 1, then subtract (2-48) → 2-48 is -46. so sum = 1 - (-46) = 1 +46=47.

sumdigit[4] =47.

6. 23 (index5):

w = ""23"".

sum starts at 0.

j runs from 1 to 2:

j=1: '3' → 3-48=3.

sum +=3 → sum=3.

since number is positive, sum += w[0]-48 → 2-48= -46. so sum=3 + (-46) = -43.

sumdigit[5] =-43.

7.4 (index6):

w = ""4"".

sum starts at 0.

j runs from 1 to 1 → no iteration.

sum +=4-48 →4-48= -44.

sumdigit[6]=-44.

so the sumdigit array is:

index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

sum: -48, -42, -42, -35,47, -43, -44.

now, the function sorts the nums vector based on sumdigit, using a bubble sort approach.

the code has a nested loop:

for i from 0 to size-1:

   for j from 1 to size-1:

      if sumdigit[j-1] > sumdigit[j], swap sumdigit[j-1] and sumdigit[j], and swap nums[j-1] and nums[j].

so it's a simple bubble sort, which sorts the sumdigit in ascending order, and the nums accordingly.

so let's list the sumdigit and nums:

initial:

sumdigit: [-48, -42, -42, -35,47, -43, -44]

nums: [0,6,6,-76,-21,23,4]

we need to sort based on sumdigit.

let me list the initial order as per sumdigit:

index 0: sum -48

index1: -42

index2: -42

index3: -35

index4:47

index5:-43

index6:-44

wait, wait, the sumdigit array is:

sumdigit[0] =-48

sumdigit[1]=-42

sumdigit[2]=-42

sumdigit[3]=-35

sumdigit[4]=47

sumdigit[5]=-43

sumdigit[6]=-44

so the initial order is:

0: -48

1: -42

2: -42

3: -35

4:47

5:-43

6:-44

wait, but when sorted in ascending order, the smallest sum comes first.

so let's list all the sumdigit values:

-48, -42, -42, -35, 47, -43, -44.

wait, wait, no: the sumdigit for index5 is -43, index6 is -44.

so the sumdigit array is:

[-48, -42, -42, -35,47, -43, -44]

wait, that's not correct because index5 is -43 and index6 is -44.

wait, no, the sumdigit array is built as:

sumdigit[0] =-48

sumdigit[1]=-42

sumdigit[2]=-42

sumdigit[3]=-35

sumdigit[4]=47

sumdigit[5]=-43

sumdigit[6]=-44

so the sumdigit array is:

[-48, -42, -42, -35,47, -43, -44]

wait, that can't be right because in the initial setup, index5 is 23, which has sumdigit -43, and index6 is 4, sumdigit -44.

so the sumdigit array is:

sumdigit[0] =-48

sumdigit[1]=-42

sumdigit[2]=-42

sumdigit[3]=-35

sumdigit[4]=47

sumdigit[5]=-43

sumdigit[6]=-44

so the sumdigit array is:

[-48, -42, -42, -35,47, -43, -44]

wait, but that's not in order. so when we perform the bubble sort, the sumdigit will be sorted in ascending order.

let me list all the sumdigit values:

-48, -42, -42, -35, 47, -43, -44.

wait, but wait, -43 is less than -42, and -44 is less than -43.

so the correct order of sumdigit from smallest to largest is:

-48, -44, -43, -42, -42, -35,47.

so the sorted sumdigit array should be:

-48, -44, -43, -42, -42, -35,47.

so the corresponding nums should be reordered accordingly.

so let's see which elements correspond to these sums.

sumdigit:

-48 → index0 → 0.

-44 → index6 →4.

-43 → index5 →23.

-42 → index1 →6.

-42 → index2 →6.

-35 → index3 →-76.

47 → index4 →-21.

so the sorted order of nums should be:

0 (sum-48), 4 (sum-44), 23 (sum-43), 6 (sum-42), 6 (sum-42), -76 (sum-35), -21 (sum47).

wait, but the expected output in the assertion is {-76, -21, 0,4,23,6,6}.

wait, that's different from what the function would produce.

wait, according to the function's sumdigit calculation, the order would be:

0,4,23,6,6,-76,-21.

but the assertion expects {-76, -21, 0,4,23,6,6}.

so the function's output would not match the assertion.

but wait, perhaps i made a mistake in the sumdigit calculation.

wait, let's recheck the sumdigit for each number.

let me recompute each number's sum as per the code.

1. 0 (index0):

w is ""0"".

sum starts at 0.

j runs from 1 to 1 → no loop.

since number is 0 (positive?), sum += w[0]-48 → 0-48= -48.

sumdigit[0] =-48.

2.6 (index1):

w is ""6"".

sum starts at 0.

j runs from 1 to 1 → no loop.

sum +=6-48= -42.

sumdigit["
