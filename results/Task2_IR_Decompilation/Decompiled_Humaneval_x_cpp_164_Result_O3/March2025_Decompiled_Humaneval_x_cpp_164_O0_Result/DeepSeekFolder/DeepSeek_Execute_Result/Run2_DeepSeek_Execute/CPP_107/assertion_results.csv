"assert (issame(even_odd_palindrome(123) , {8, 13}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion in the given c++ code passes or fails. the function is supposed to count the number of even and odd palindromes up to a given n. the assertion is checking if even_odd_palindrome(123) returns {8,13}.

first, i should understand what the function does. the function loops through each number from 1 to n, converts each to a string, reverses it, and checks if it's a palindrome. if it is, it increments either num1 (for odd) or num2 (for even).

wait, looking at the code, the return statement is {num2, num1}, which means the first element is the count of even palindromes and the second is odd. so in the examples, for input 3, the output is (1,2), which matches 1 even (2) and 2 odds (1,3).

now, the assertion is for n=123. i need to calculate how many even and odd palindromes there are up to 123.

let me list all palindromes up to 123.

palindromes are numbers that read the same forwards and backwards. so single-digit numbers (1-9) are all palindromes. then two-digit numbers where both digits are the same, like 11,22,...,99. for three digits, the first and last digits must be the same, like 101, 111, 121, etc.

let me list them:

single-digit: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 → 9 numbers.

two-digit: 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99 → 9 numbers.

three-digit: 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212, 222, 232, 242, 252, 262, 272, 282, 292, 303, 313, 323, 333, 343, 353, 363, 373, 383, 393, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484, 494, 505, 515, 525, 535, 545, 555, 565, 575, 585, 595, 606, 616, 626, 636, 646, 656, 666, 676, 686, 696, 707, 717, 727, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787, 797, 808, 818, 828, 838, 848, 858, 868, 878, 888, 898, 909, 919, 929, 939, 949, 959, 969, 979, 989, 999. wait, but wait, n is 123, so three-digit numbers go up to 123. so the three-digit palindromes up to 123 are 101, 111, 121. because 131 is 131 which is larger than 123, so it's beyond.

wait, wait, 101 is 101, which is less than 123. 111 is 111, 121 is 121. next would be 131, which is 131 >123, so stop.

so three-digit palindromes up to 123 are 101, 111, 121.

so total palindromes:

single-digit: 9.

two-digit: 9.

three-digit: 3.

total: 21 palindromes.

now, among these, count how many are even and how many are odd.

let's go through each:

single-digit (1-9):

even: 2,4,6,8 → 4 numbers.

odd: 1,3,5,7,9 →5 numbers.

two-digit palindromes (11,22,...,99):

each is a two-digit number where both digits are same. so 11 is 11 (odd), 22 even, 33 odd, etc.

so for two-digit:

numbers: 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99.

even ones are 22,44,66,88 →4.

odd ones are 11,33,55,77,99 →5.

three-digit palindromes up to 123: 101,111,121.

101 is odd, 111 is odd, 121 is odd. so all three are odd.

so adding up:

even palindromes:

single-digit:4.

two-digit:4.

three-digit:0.

total even: 4+4=8.

odd palindromes:

single-digit:5.

two-digit:5.

three-digit:3.

total odd:5+5+3=13.

so the function should return {8,13}, which matches the assertion.

wait, but let me double-check. the function returns {num2, num1}, where num2 is even count, num1 is odd.

in the code, for each i, if it's a palindrome and even, num2 increases. if it's a palindrome and odd, num1 increases.

so for n=123, the counts are 8 even and 13 odd. so the function returns {8,13}, which is exactly what the assertion expects.

so the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly counts the even and odd palindromes up to 123, returning {8,13}, which matches the assertion.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(even_odd_palindrome(12) , {4, 6}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the provided c++ function passes the given assertion. the function is supposed to count even and odd palindromic numbers up to a given n. the assertion checks if the output for n=12 is {4,6}.

first, i'll look at the function. it initializes num1 and num2 to zero. then, for each number from 1 to n, it converts the number to a string, reverses it, and checks if it's a palindrome. if it is, it increments num1 for odd numbers and num2 for even.

wait, wait. wait a minute. let me see: the code says if (w == p and i%2 ==1) then num1 increases. so num1 is counting odd palindromes. similarly, num2 is for even. then the function returns {num2, num1}, which is even count first, then odd.

so the output is a vector where the first element is the number of even palindromes, the second is odd.

now, the assertion is checking if even_odd_palindrome(12) equals {4,6}. so according to the function, the first number should be 4 (even) and the second 6 (odd).

let me manually compute the palindromes up to 12.

palindromes between 1 and 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11.

wait, wait, wait. let me list all numbers from 1 to 12 and check which are palindromes.

1: yes, single digit.
2: yes.
3: yes.
4: yes.
5: yes.
6: yes.
7: yes.
8: yes.
9: yes.
10: reversed is 01, which is 1, so 10 !=1, not a palindrome.
11: yes.
12: reversed is 21, which is not equal to 12, so no.

so the palindromes are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11. that's 10 numbers.

now, let's count how many are even and how many are odd.

even numbers in the list: 2,4,6,8. so 4 even.

odd numbers: 1,3,5,7,9,11. that's 6.

so the function should return {4,6}, which matches the assertion.

wait, but let me check the function again. because in the code, for each i, it's checking if it's a palindrome, then checking if it's odd or even.

so for i=1, it's a palindrome and odd: num1 increases by 1.

i=2: palindrome, even: num2 increases by 1.

similarly, i=3: num1, i=4: num2, etc.

so for the list:

1: num1=1
2: num2=1
3: num1=2
4: num2=2
5: num1=3
6: num2=3
7: num1=4
8: num2=4
9: num1=5
11: num1=6.

so yes, num2 is 4, num1 is 6. so the function returns {4,6}, which is correct.

so the assertion should pass.

wait, but in the example 1, when n=3, the output is (1,2). let's see: palindromes are 1,2,3. even is 2, so count is 1. odd is 1 and 3: count 2. so function returns {1,2}, which is correct.

another test case: n=2. palindromes are 1 and 2. so even count is 1, odd is 1. so function returns {1,1}.

wait, but what about n=1? then only 1, which is odd. so function returns {0,1}.

so the function seems correct.

therefore, the assertion for n=12 should pass.
</think>

the function correctly counts the even and odd palindromes up to 12, returning {4,6}, which matches the assertion.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(even_odd_palindrome(3) , {1, 2}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's start by understanding the problem.

the function even_odd_palindrome is supposed to count the number of even and odd palindromic integers within the range (1, n), inclusive. the output is a vector where the first element is the count of even palindromes and the second is the count of odd ones.

looking at the example 1: input is 3. the palindromes are 1, 2, 3. among these, 2 is even (so count is 1) and 1 and 3 are odd (count is 2). the output is (1,2), which matches the example.

now, let's examine the code. the function loops through each integer i from 1 to n. for each i, it converts it to a string, reverses it, and checks if it's a palindrome. if it is, it then checks if the number is even or odd and increments the respective counters.

wait, in the code, the variables are num1 and num2. let's see how they are used. the code increments num1 when the number is odd and a palindrome, and num2 when even. then, the function returns a vector {num2, num1}. so the first element is the even count, the second is the odd count.

in the assertion, the expected result is {1,2}, which is correct for the first example. so the function should return {1,2} when n is 3.

let me test this with the code. for i=1: it's a palindrome and odd, so num1 becomes 1. i=2: palindrome and even, num2 becomes 1. i=3: palindrome and odd, num1 becomes 2. so the function returns {1,2}, which matches the assertion.

wait, but in the code, the return is {num2, num1}, which would be 1 and 2. so the vector is (1,2), which is correct.

so the assertion should pass because the function returns the correct counts.

i think the code is correct for this case. so the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly counts the even and odd palindromes for n=3, returning (1,2), which matches the assertion.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(even_odd_palindrome(63) , {6, 8}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion in the given c++ code passes or fails. the function even_odd_palindrome is supposed to return a vector with the count of even and odd palindromes up to a given n. the assertion checks if the output for n=63 is {6,8}.

first, i should understand what the function does. it iterates through each number from 1 to n, converts each to a string, reverses it, and checks if it's a palindrome. then, it increments num1 for odd palindromes and num2 for even ones. finally, it returns a vector with num2 followed by num1.

wait, looking at the return statement: it's {num2, num1}. so the first element is the count of even palindromes, the second is odd. but in the examples, for input 3, the output is (1,2), which corresponds to 1 even (2) and 2 odds (1,3). so the function returns even count first, then odd.

now, the assertion is checking if even_odd_palindrome(63) returns {6,8}. so that would mean 6 even palindromes and 8 odd ones up to 63.

i need to list all palindromes from 1 to 63 and count how many are even and how many are odd.

let me list them:

1-digit numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. all are palindromes. among these, even are 2,4,6,8 → 4 evens. odds are 1,3,5,7,9 →5 odds.

two-digit palindromes: numbers where both digits are same. so 11,22,33,44,55,66. wait, wait, wait. wait, two-digit palindromes are numbers like 11, 22, etc. let's see:

two-digit palindromes are numbers where the first and last digits are same. so for two digits, it's numbers like 11, 22, ..., 99. so from 11 to 99, step 11? no, wait, each two-digit palindrome is formed by same digits, so 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. so that's 9 numbers.

wait, but wait, 11 is 11, 22 is 22, etc. so for two-digit palindromes, the count is 9.

but wait, wait, 11 is 11, which is 11, which is a two-digit palindrome. so for two-digit, there are 9 numbers.

now, for each two-digit palindrome, check if it's even or odd.

11: odd
22: even
33: odd
44: even
55: odd
66: even
77: odd
88: even
99: odd

so in two-digit palindromes, there are 4 even (22,44,66,88) and 5 odd (11,33,55,77,99).

wait, 9 two-digit palindromes: 4 even, 5 odd.

now, three-digit palindromes up to 63. wait, 63 is the upper limit. so three-digit numbers start from 100, but 100 is beyond 63. so no three-digit palindromes in this case.

wait, wait, 63 is less than 100, so all palindromes are either 1-digit or 2-digit.

so total palindromes up to 63 are 9 (1-digit) + 9 (two-digit) = 18.

wait, let me recount:

1-digit: 9 numbers (1-9)
two-digit: 9 numbers (11,22,...,99). but wait, 99 is 99, which is larger than 63. so wait, wait, no. because n is 63, so two-digit palindromes up to 63 are 11,22,33,44,55,66. because 77 is 77 which is larger than 63? no, 77 is 77, which is larger than 63. so wait, 63 is 63, so two-digit palindromes up to 63 are those where the number is <=63.

so two-digit palindromes are 11,22,33,44,55,66. because 77 is 77, which is 77>63, so it's excluded. similarly, 88 and 99 are way above.

so two-digit palindromes up to 63 are 11,22,33,44,55,66. so 6 numbers.

wait, wait, 11 is 11, which is <=63. 22 is 22, yes. 33 is 33, yes. 44 is 44, yes. 55 is 55, yes. 66 is 66, which is 66>63? no, 66 is 66, which is larger than 63. so 66 is 66, which is 66>63, so it's excluded.

wait, wait, 66 is 66, which is larger than 63, so it's not included. so two-digit palindromes up to 63 are 11,22,33,44,55. so 5 numbers.

wait, wait, 55 is 55, which is <=63. 66 is 66, which is 66>63, so excluded.

so two-digit palindromes up to 63 are 11,22,33,44,55. so 5 numbers.

wait, but wait, 11 is 11, 22 is 22, 33 is 33, 44 is 44, 55 is 55. so 5 numbers.

so now, let's count:

1-digit palindromes: 9 (1-9)
two-digit palindromes: 5 (11,22,33,44,55)

wait, but wait, 55 is 55, which is 55 <=63. so yes.

so total palindromes: 9 +5=14.

wait, but earlier i thought two-digit palindromes up to 63 are 5, but let me double-check.

wait, 11 is 11, which is <=63: yes.
22: 22 <=63: yes.
33: 33 <=63: yes.
44:44 <=63: yes.
55:55 <=63: yes.
66:66>63: no.
so two-digit palindromes up to 63 are 11,22,33,44,55: 5 numbers.

so total palindromes: 9+5=14.

now, among these 14, how many are even and how many are odd.

1-digit palindromes:

even: 2,4,6,8 →4
odd:1,3,5,7,9 →5

two-digit palindromes:

11: odd
22: even
33: odd
44: even
55: odd

so in two-digit, 2 even (22,44) and 3 odd (11,33,55).

so total even palindromes: 4 (from 1-digit) + 2 (from two-digit) =6.

total odd palindromes:5 (from 1-digit) +3 (from two-digit) =8.

so the function should return {6,8}, which matches the assertion.

wait, but wait, the function returns {num2, num1}, which is even count first, then odd. so the vector is (6,8), which is what the assertion expects.

so the assertion should pass.

but wait, let me make sure i didn't miss any palindromes.

wait, wait, another approach: list all palindromes up to 63.

1-digit: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 →9 numbers.

two-digit: 11,22,33,44,55 →5 numbers.

wait, 66 is 66, which is 66>63, so not included.

so total 14 palindromes.

now, count even and odd:

1-digit evens: 2,4,6,8 →4
1-digit odds:5

two-digit evens:22,44 →2
two-digit odds:11,33,55 →3

total evens:4+2=6
total odds:5+3=8

so the function returns {6,8}, which is correct.

thus, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly counts 6 even and 8 odd palindromes up to 63. the assertion expects {6,8}, which matches the result.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(even_odd_palindrome(25) , {5, 6}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion passes or fails. the function in question is even_odd_palindrome, which counts the number of even and odd palindromes up to n. the assertion is checking if the output for n=25 is {5,6}.

first, i'll understand what the function does. it iterates from 1 to n, converts each number to a string, reverses it, and checks if it's a palindrome. then, it increments num1 for odd palindromes and num2 for even ones. finally, it returns a vector with num2 first and num1 second.

wait, looking at the return statement: return {num2, num1};. so the first element is the count of even palindromes, the second is odd.

now, the assertion is expecting {5,6}, which would mean 5 even and 6 odd palindromes up to 25.

i need to list all palindromes from 1 to 25 and count them.

let me list them:

1: yes, palindrome. odd.
2: yes. even.
3: yes. odd.
4: yes. even.
5: yes. odd.
6: yes. even.
7: yes. odd.
8: yes. even.
9: yes. odd.
11: yes. odd.
22: yes. even.

wait, wait. wait, 10 is 10, reversed is 01 which is 1, so not a palindrome. so 10 is not a palindrome.

wait, let me list all numbers from 1 to 25 and check which are palindromes.

1: palindrome (1 digit)
2: yes
3: yes
4: yes
5: yes
6: yes
7: yes
8: yes
9: yes
10: 10 reversed is 01, which is 1, not equal to 10. so no.
11: yes
12: 12 vs 21, no.
13: no
14: no
15: no
16: no
17: no
18: no
19: no
20: 20 vs 02=2, no.
21: 21 vs 12, no.
22: yes
23: no
24: no
25: no.

wait, so the palindromes are: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,22.

wait, wait, what about 22? yes, 22 is a palindrome. so that's 11 numbers.

wait, let me count again:

1: yes
2: yes
3: yes
4: yes
5: yes
6: yes
7: yes
8: yes
9: yes
11: yes
22: yes.

so that's 11 palindromes in total.

now, among these, how many are even and how many are odd.

looking at each:

1: odd
2: even
3: odd
4: even
5: odd
6: even
7: odd
8: even
9: odd
11: odd
22: even.

so let's count the evens:

2,4,6,8,22. that's 5 even palindromes.

the odds are 1,3,5,7,9,11. that's 6.

so the function should return {5,6}.

wait, but the function returns {num2, num1}, where num2 is even count, num1 is odd. so yes, 5 and 6.

so the assertion expects {5,6}, which is exactly what the function returns.

wait, but wait: the function's return is {num2, num1}, which is even count first, then odd. so in the example given in the problem statement, for n=3, the output is (1,2). let's check:

palindromes are 1,2,3. even is 2 (count 1), odd is 1 and 3 (count 2). so function returns {1,2}, which is correct.

similarly, for n=12, the palindromes are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11. even palindromes: 2,4,6,8 → 4. odd: 1,3,5,7,9,11 →6. so function returns {4,6}, which matches the example.

so for n=25, the function should return {5,6}, which is what the assertion expects. so the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me double-check the function's code.

in the loop, for each i from 1 to n:

- convert to string w.
- reverse it to p.
- if w == p, then check if i is odd or even.

if i is odd, increment num1 (count of odd palindromes).
if even, increment num2.

so for i=1, it's a palindrome and odd → num1 +=1.
i=2: even → num2 +=1.
and so on.

so for i=22, which is even, num2 increments.

so the counts are correct.

thus, the function returns {5,6} for n=25, which matches the assertion. so the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly counts the even and odd palindromes up to 25, returning {5,6}, which matches the assertion.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(even_odd_palindrome(19) , {4, 6}));",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the assertion passes or fails. the function is supposed to return a vector with the count of even and odd palindromes up to n. the assertion is checking if even_odd_palindrome(19) returns {4,6}.

first, i'll look at the code. the function loops from 1 to n, converts each number to a string, reverses it, and checks if it's a palindrome. then, it increments num1 for odd palindromes and num2 for even ones. finally, it returns {num2, num1}.

wait, wait. wait, the return is {num2, num1}, which is even count first, then odd. so the output vector is (even, odd). so in the examples, for input 3, the output is (1,2), which matches 1 even (2) and 2 odds (1,3).

now, the assertion is checking for n=19. so i need to list all palindromes from 1 to 19 and count how many are even and odd.

let me list all numbers from 1 to 19 and identify the palindromes.

1: yes, single digit.
2: yes.
3: yes.
4: yes.
5: yes.
6: yes.
7: yes.
8: yes.
9: yes.
10: 10 reversed is 01, which is 1, so not a palindrome.
11: yes.
12: 21, no.
13: 31, no.
14:41, no.
15:51, no.
16:61, no.
17:71, no.
18:81, no.
19:91, no.

so the palindromes are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11.

now, among these, count how many are even and how many are odd.

even palindromes: 2,4,6,8. so 4 even.

odd palindromes: 1,3,5,7,9,11. that's 6.

so the function should return {4,6}, which is exactly what the assertion expects.

wait, but let me double-check. wait, the function returns {num2, num1}, where num2 is even count and num1 is odd. so in the code, for each i, if it's a palindrome and even, num2 increments. if it's a palindrome and odd, num1 increments.

so for n=19, the function should compute 4 even and 6 odd, so the vector is {4,6}.

so the assertion is correct. therefore, the function should return {4,6}, so the assertion passes.

wait, but wait another thing. let me make sure i didn't miss any palindromes beyond 11. for n=19, the next palindrome after 11 is 22, which is beyond 19. so yes, only up to 11.

so the counts are correct. so the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly counts 4 even and 6 odd palindromes up to 19, so the assertion passes.

### final result

"assert (issame(even_odd_palindrome(9) , {4, 5}));",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the assertion passes or fails. the function in question is even_odd_palindrome, which counts the number of even and odd palindromes up to a given n. the assertion is checking if even_odd_palindrome(9) returns {4,5}.

first, i should understand what the function does. it iterates from 1 to n, converts each number to a string, reverses it, and checks if it's a palindrome. then, it counts how many are even and how many are odd.

let me think about what the palindromes are when n is 9. palindromes are numbers that read the same forwards and backwards. so for numbers 1 through 9:

1: yes, it's a palindrome. 1 is odd.
2: yes, even.
3: yes, odd.
4: yes, even.
5: yes, odd.
6: yes, even.
7: yes, odd.
8: yes, even.
9: yes, odd.

wait, wait. wait, wait. wait, 2 is a single-digit number, so it's a palindrome. same with all single-digit numbers. so from 1 to 9, all are palindromes except maybe none. so that's 9 numbers.

wait, but wait, the function counts from 1 to n, inclusive. so for n=9, the numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. all of them are palindromes because they're single-digit.

so how many even and odd are there?

let's list them:

1: odd
2: even
3: odd
4: even
5: odd
6: even
7: odd
8: even
9: odd

so count of even palindromes: 2,4,6,8 → 4 even.

count of odd palindromes: 1,3,5,7,9 → 5 odd.

so the function should return {4,5}.

wait, but looking at the function's return statement: it returns {num2, num1}. because in the code, num1 is incremented when the number is odd, num2 when even. so the return is a vector where the first element is the count of even palindromes, and the second is odd.

so for n=9, the function should return (4,5), which is exactly what the assertion is checking.

wait, but let me double-check the code. let me see:

in the loop, for each i from 1 to n:

- convert i to string w.
- reverse it to p.
- if w == p, then it's a palindrome.
- if it's a palindrome and i is odd, increment num1.
- if it's a palindrome and i is even, increment num2.

so for i=1: palindrome, odd → num1=1.
i=2: palindrome, even → num2=1.
i=3: palindrome, odd → num1=2.
i=4: palindrome, even → num2=2.
i=5: palindrome, odd → num1=3.
i=6: palindrome, even → num2=3.
i=7: palindrome, odd → num1=4.
i=8: palindrome, even → num2=4.
i=9: palindrome, odd → num1=5.

so after the loop, num2 is 4, num1 is 5. so the function returns {4,5}, which matches the assertion.

so the assertion should pass.

wait, but wait another thing. let me make sure i'm not missing any other palindromes beyond single-digit numbers. oh, wait, n is 9, so all numbers are single-digit. so no two-digit numbers involved here.

so yes, the function correctly counts 4 even and 5 odd palindromes, so the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly counts the even and odd palindromes for n=9. the assertion expects {4,5}, which matches the function's output.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(even_odd_palindrome(1) , {0, 1}));",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's start by understanding the problem.

the function even_odd_palindrome is supposed to count the number of even and odd palindromic integers within the range (1, n), inclusive. the output is a vector where the first element is the count of even palindromes and the second is the count of odd ones.

looking at the code, the function initializes two counters, num1 and num2, to zero. then it loops through each integer i from 1 to n. for each i, it converts the number to a string, reverses it, and checks if the reversed string is equal to the original. if it is a palindrome, it then checks if the number is odd or even and increments the respective counter.

wait, wait. let me look at the conditionals. the first if statement is: if (w == p and i%2 == 1), then num1 increases. the second is if (w == p and i%2 == 0), then num2 increases. so num1 is counting odd palindromes, and num2 is even. but the function returns {num2, num1}, which means the first element is even count, second is odd. that's correct based on the problem statement.

now, the assertion is checking if even_odd_palindrome(1) returns {0, 1}. let's see what happens when n is 1.

when i=1, the string is ""1"", reversed is also ""1"", so it's a palindrome. since 1 is odd, num1 increments by 1. so num1 is 1, num2 is 0. the function returns {0, 1}, which matches the assertion's expected value.

wait, but wait a second. let me double-check the code. oh, no, wait: the function returns {num2, num1}, which would be {0,1} in this case. so the assertion expects {0,1}, which is correct.

so the function should return {0,1} for n=1, which is exactly what the assertion is checking. therefore, the assertion should pass.

but wait, let me think again. the function's return is {num2, num1}, which for i=1, num2 is 0 (since 1 is odd), and num1 is 1. so yes, the vector is {0,1}, which matches the assertion.

so the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly counts the even and odd palindromes. for n=1, the only palindrome is 1, which is odd. thus, the function returns {0,1}, matching the assertion.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
