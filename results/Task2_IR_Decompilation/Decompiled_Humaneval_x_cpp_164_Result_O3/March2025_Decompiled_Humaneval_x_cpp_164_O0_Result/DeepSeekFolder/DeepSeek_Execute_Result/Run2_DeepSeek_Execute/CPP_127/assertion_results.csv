"assert (intersection({1, 2}, {2, 3}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. the assertion is checking if the function intersection returns ""no"" when given the intervals {1,2} and {2,3}. 

let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. the function takes two intervals, each represented as a vector of two integers. each interval is a pair (start, end), and it's inclusive. the task is to determine if the length of their intersection is a prime number. if it is, return ""yes""; otherwise, return ""no"". also, if there's no intersection, return ""no"".

so, the first step is to find the intersection of the two intervals. the intersection's start is the maximum of the two starts, and the end is the minimum of the two ends. then, the length is end minus start. if this length is less than 2, we immediately return ""no"" because primes are greater than 1. otherwise, we check if the length is a prime.

looking at the code provided:

the function starts by calculating inter1 as the max of interval1[0] and interval2[0], which is the start of the intersection. inter2 is the min of interval1[1] and interval2[1], the end. then, l is inter2 - inter1. if l is less than 2, return ""no"". otherwise, check for factors from 2 up to sqrt(l). if any divisor is found, return ""no""; else, return ""yes"".

now, the assertion is for the case where the intervals are {1,2} and {2,3}. let's compute the intersection.

the start of the intersection is max(1, 2) = 2. the end is min(2,3) = 2. so the intersection is from 2 to 2. the length is 2 - 2 = 0. 

wait, wait. wait, the length is 0? because the end is not greater than the start. so the intersection is empty. so the function should return ""no"" because there's no intersection.

but wait, let me look at the code again. the code calculates l as inter2 - inter1. so in this case, 2 - 2 is 0. then, the code checks if l < 2. since 0 is less than 2, it returns ""no"". so the function correctly returns ""no"" for this case.

so the assertion expects the function to return ""no"", which it does. therefore, the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me think again. the function's code for the case where inter2 < inter1 would result in l being negative. but in the code, l is inter2 - inter1. so if inter2 is less than inter1, l would be negative. then, l < 2 would be true, so it returns ""no"". so that's correct.

in the given example, the two intervals are {1,2} and {2,3}. the intersection is at 2, but since both intervals include 2, the intersection is a single point. so the length is 0. so the function correctly returns ""no"".

so the assertion is correct, and the function behaves as expected. therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly returns ""no"" for the given intervals because their intersection has a length of 0, which is less than 2. hence, the assertion passes.

                - **assertion result**: **pass**"

okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's start by understanding what the code is supposed to do.

the function 'intersection' takes two intervals as input. each interval is a vector with two integers, representing the start and end of the interval. the task is to determine if the length of their intersection is a prime number. if it is, return ""yes""; otherwise, return ""no"". also, if there's no intersection, return ""no"".

let me look at the code step by step.

first, the code calculates the intersection's start and end. it takes the maximum of the two starts (inter1) and the minimum of the two ends (inter2). then, it computes the length 'l' as inter2 - inter1.

if 'l' is less than 2, it returns ""no"" immediately. because a prime number must be at least 2. so if the intersection length is 0 or 1, it's not prime.

otherwise, it checks if 'l' is a prime. it does this by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of 'l'. if any divisor is found, it returns ""no""; otherwise, returns ""yes"".

now, looking at the assertion: intersection({-1, 1}, {0, 4}) should return ""no"".

let's compute the intersection of these two intervals.

interval1 is (-1, 1), interval2 is (0,4).

the intersection's start is max(-1, 0) = 0. the end is min(1,4) = 1. so the intersection is (0,1), which has a length of 1-0=1.

since 1 is less than 2, the code returns ""no"", which matches the assertion. so the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me make sure i didn't make a mistake. let me re-calculate:

interval1: from -1 to 1, including both. interval2: from 0 to 4, including both. the overlapping part is from 0 to 1. so the length is 1. since 1 is not a prime, the function returns ""no"", which is correct.

so the assertion expects ""no"", and the code returns ""no"", so the assertion passes.

i think that's correct. so the result should be pass.
</think>

the assertion checks if the intersection of intervals (-1,1) and (0,4) returns ""no"". the intersection length is 1, which is not a prime, so the function correctly returns ""no"". thus, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({-3, -1}, {-5, 5}) == ""YES"");",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's start by understanding the problem and the code.

the task is to determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number. if it is, return ""yes""; otherwise, return ""no"". if there's no intersection, also return ""no"".

looking at the code, the function `intersection` takes two vectors, each representing an interval. the intervals are given as pairs of integers, and each interval is closed, meaning the endpoints are included.

first, the code calculates the intersection's start and end points. the start of the intersection is the maximum of the two intervals' starts, and the end is the minimum of the two intervals' ends. then, it calculates the length as `inter2 - inter1`.

if the length is less than 2, it returns ""no"" immediately because primes are greater than 1. otherwise, it checks if the length is a prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the length. if any divisor is found, it returns ""no""; otherwise, it returns ""yes"".

now, looking at the specific assertion: `intersection({-3, -1}, {-5, 5}) == ""yes""`. let's compute this step by step.

the first interval is (-3, -1), and the second is (-5, 5). the intersection's start is the maximum of -3 and -5, which is -3. the end is the minimum of -1 and 5, which is -1. so the intersection is from -3 to -1, inclusive.

the length is calculated as (-1) - (-3) = 2. so the length is 2.

now, checking if 2 is a prime. well, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself. so the function should return ""yes"".

looking at the code, when l is 2, the condition `if (l < 2)` is false, so it proceeds to the loop. the loop starts at i=2 and checks if i*i <= l. since 2*2=4, which is greater than 2, the loop doesn't run. so the function returns ""yes"".

therefore, the assertion should pass because the function correctly returns ""yes"" for this case.
</think>

the assertion passes because the intersection length is 2, which is a prime number.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({-2, 2}, {-4, 0}) == ""YES"");",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's break down the problem step by step.

first, let's understand the function's purpose. the function `intersection` takes two intervals as input, each represented by a vector of two integers. it calculates the intersection of these intervals and checks if the length of this intersection is a prime number. if it is, the function returns ""yes""; otherwise, it returns ""no"". also, if the intervals don't intersect, it returns ""no"".

the assertion given is `intersection({-2, 2}, {-4, 0}) == ""yes""`. so i need to see what the function returns for these intervals.

let's find the intersection of the two intervals. the first interval is from -2 to 2, and the second is from -4 to 0.

the intersection starts at the maximum of the two starts. so max(-2, -4) is -2. the end is the minimum of the two ends, which is min(2, 0) = 0. so the intersection is from -2 to 0.

the length of this intersection is 0 - (-2) = 2. now, we need to check if 2 is a prime number.

wait, what's a prime number? a prime is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. so 2 is a prime because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

looking at the code, the function calculates `l` as the length. then, if `l < 2`, it returns ""no"". since 2 is not less than 2, it proceeds. then it checks for factors from 2 up to sqrt(l). for l=2, the loop runs with i=2. i*i is 4, which is greater than 2, so the loop doesn't execute. thus, the function returns ""yes"".

so the assertion expects ""yes"", and the function returns ""yes"". therefore, the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me double-check the code. the code computes `l = inter2 - inter1`. in this case, inter1 is -2, inter2 is 0. so 0 - (-2) is 2, correct.

then, the code checks if l < 2. since 2 is not less than 2, it proceeds. then, the loop starts at i=2, and checks if i*i <= l. i is 2, i*i is 4, which is greater than 2, so the loop doesn't run. so the function returns ""yes"".

yes, that's correct. so the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function correctly calculates the intersection length as 2, which is a prime number, so the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({-11, 2}, {-1, -1}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

the function 'intersection' takes two intervals, each represented as a vector of two integers. the goal is to determine if the length of their intersection is a prime number. if it is, return ""yes""; otherwise, return ""no"". also, if the intervals don't intersect, return ""no"".

first, let's look at the code step by step.

the code calculates the intersection's start and end points. it finds the maximum of the two starts (inter1) and the minimum of the two ends (inter2). then, it computes the length 'l' as inter2 - inter1.

if 'l' is less than 2, it returns ""no"" immediately. because a prime number must be greater than 1, so any length less than 2 can't be prime.

otherwise, it checks if 'l' is a prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to sqrt(l). if any divisor is found, it returns ""no""; else, returns ""yes"".

now, let's look at the assertion: intersection({-11, 2}, {-1, -1}) should return ""no"".

let's compute the intersection of these two intervals.

interval1 is (-11, 2), which includes all numbers from -11 to 2, including both ends.
interval2 is (-1, -1), which is just a single point, -1.

the intersection of these two intervals would be the overlapping part. so, the start of the intersection is the maximum of -11 and -1, which is -1. the end is the minimum of 2 and -1, which is -1. so the intersection is (-1, -1), which is a single point.

the length 'l' is inter2 - inter1, which is (-1) - (-1) = 0. so l is 0.

in the code, if l < 2, it returns ""no"". since 0 is less than 2, it returns ""no"", which matches the assertion.

wait, but let me double-check. the intervals are (-11,2) and (-1,-1). the first interval includes -1 because it's between -11 and 2. the second interval is just -1. so their intersection is indeed {-1}, which has length 0.

so the code correctly returns ""no"" for this case.

therefore, the assertion should pass because the function returns ""no"" as expected.
</think>

the assertion checks if the function correctly returns ""no"" when the intersection length is 0, which is not a prime. the code handles this case by returning ""no"" when the length is less than 2.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({1, 2}, {3, 5}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

the function is called intersection and takes two vectors, interval1 and interval2. each interval is a pair of integers representing a closed interval. the task is to determine if the length of their intersection is a prime number. if it is, return ""yes""; otherwise, return ""no"". also, if there's no intersection, return ""no"".

looking at the code, the first step is to compute the intersection's start and end. the start is the maximum of the two intervals' starts, and the end is the minimum of the two intervals' ends. then, the length l is calculated as inter2 - inter1.

wait, but if inter2 is less than inter1, then l would be negative. so i should check if l is positive. oh, right, because if the intervals don't overlap, inter2 would be less than inter1, making l negative. but in the code, they check if l < 2, which would include negative numbers as well. so if l is less than 2, return ""no"".

wait, but the length can't be negative because inter1 is the max of the starts and inter2 is the min of the ends. so if inter1 > inter2, then the intervals don't overlap, so l would be negative. so in that case, the code returns ""no"", which is correct.

now, for the case where l is 0 or 1. for example, if the intervals just touch at a point, like (2,2) and (2,3), the intersection is (2,2), so length is 0. or if the intersection is a single point, like (2,3) and (3,4), the intersection is (3,3), length 0. or wait, no, wait: the intervals are closed, so (2,3) and (3,4) would have an intersection of (3,3), which is a length of 0. so in such cases, the code returns ""no"" because l is 0, which is less than 2.

but wait, the code computes l as inter2 - inter1. so if inter1 is 3 and inter2 is 3, l is 0. so yes, that's correct.

now, the assertion given is intersection({1,2}, {3,5}) == ""no"". let's see what happens in this case.

compute inter1: max(1,3) is 3.
compute inter2: min(2,5) is 2.
so l is 2 - 3 = -1, which is less than 2. so the function returns ""no"", which matches the assertion. so the assertion should pass.

wait, but wait another thing. let me recheck the code. the code calculates l as inter2 - inter1. so if inter1 is 3 and inter2 is 2, l is -1. then, the code checks if l < 2. since -1 is less than 2, it returns ""no"". so yes, the function correctly returns ""no"" for this case.

so the assertion expects ""no"", and the function returns ""no"", so the assertion passes.

i think that's correct. so the final result is that the assertion passes.
</think>

the assertion checks if the intersection of intervals (1,2) and (3,5) returns ""no"". the code correctly calculates that there's no overlap, so the length is negative, leading to a return of ""no"". thus, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({1, 2}, {1, 2}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. the assertion is checking if the function intersection returns ""no"" when the intervals are {1,2} and {1,2}. 

first, let me understand what the function does. the function calculates the intersection of two intervals. each interval is a pair of integers, and the intervals are closed, meaning they include both endpoints. the function then checks if the length of this intersection is a prime number. if it is, it returns ""yes""; otherwise, it returns ""no"". if there's no intersection, it also returns ""no"".

so, the steps the function takes are:

1. find the maximum of the two start points (inter1 = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])).
2. find the minimum of the two end points (inter2 = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])).
3. calculate the length of the intersection as l = inter2 - inter1.
4. if l is less than 2, return ""no"" because prime numbers are greater than 1.
5. check if l is a prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to sqrt(l). if any divisor is found, return ""no"".
6. if no divisors are found, return ""yes"".

now, looking at the assertion: intersection({1,2}, {1,2}) should return ""no"".

let's compute the intersection. the intervals are exactly the same, so the intersection is from 1 to 2. the length is 2 - 1 = 1. 

wait, wait. wait a second. the length is 1. because 2 - 1 is 1. so l is 1. 

in the function, the first condition is if (l < 2) return ""no"". since 1 is less than 2, the function returns ""no"". 

so the assertion expects ""no"", which is exactly what the function returns. therefore, the assertion should pass.

wait, but wait again. let me double-check. the function's code says:

l = inter2 - inter1;

in the case where both intervals are {1,2}, inter1 is max(1,1) =1, inter2 is min(2,2)=2. so l is 2-1=1.

then, the function checks if l <2. 1 is less than 2, so it returns ""no"". so yes, the function returns ""no"" as expected.

therefore, the assertion should pass because the function correctly returns ""no"" for this case.
</think>

the function correctly returns ""no"" for the given intervals because the intersection length is 1, which is less than 2. hence, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({-2, -2}, {-3, -2}) == ""NO"");",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's break this down step by step.

first, let's understand the problem. the function `intersection` takes two intervals and checks if the length of their intersection is a prime number. if it is, it returns ""yes""; otherwise, ""no"". if the intervals don't intersect, it also returns ""no"".

looking at the code, the function calculates the intersection's start and end. the start is the maximum of the two intervals' starts, and the end is the minimum of the two intervals' ends. the length is then end minus start. if this length is less than 2, it returns ""no"" because primes are greater than 1. otherwise, it checks for factors up to the square root of the length. if any factor is found, it returns ""no""; else, ""yes"".

now, the assertion given is `intersection({-2, -2}, {-3, -2}) == ""no""`. let's compute what the function does for these intervals.

the first interval is (-2, -2), which is just a single point. the second is (-3, -2), which includes all points from -3 up to and including -2.

calculating the intersection:
- inter1 is max(-2, -3) = -2.
- inter2 is min(-2, -2) = -2.
so the intersection is from -2 to -2, which is a single point. the length is inter2 - inter1 = 0.

wait, wait. wait, the length is calculated as l = inter2 - inter1. so in this case, it's (-2) - (-2) = 0. so l is 0.

in the code, the first check is if (l < 2) return ""no"". since 0 is less than 2, the function returns ""no"".

so the assertion expects ""no"", which matches the function's output. therefore, the assertion should pass.

wait, but wait another thing. the problem statement says that each interval is a pair where start <= end. so the first interval is (-2, -2), which is valid. the second is (-3, -2), which is also valid because -3 <= -2.

the intersection is when both intervals overlap. since the first interval is just the point -2, and the second includes that point, the intersection is that single point. so the length is 0, which is correct.

so the function correctly returns ""no"" because 0 is less than 2, and the assertion expects ""no"", so the assertion passes.
</think>

the function correctly returns ""no"" for the given intervals because their intersection length is 0, which is less than 2. hence, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
