assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c++ code for the function get_row. let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

from the problem statement, the function get_row takes a 2d vector (lst) and an integer x. it should find all occurrences of x in the nested vectors and return a vector of coordinates. each coordinate is a vector containing the row and column indices where x was found. the coordinates should be sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, sorted by column in descending order.

looking at the examples provided:

1. the first example has a 3x6 matrix. when x is 1, the function returns coordinates sorted by row, and within each row, columns are in descending order. so for row 0, column 0 is the only occurrence. for row 1, columns 4 and 0 are found, so they are ordered as 4, then 0. similarly for row 2, columns 5 and 0 are ordered as 5, then 0.

2. the second example is an empty list, so the result is empty.

3. the third example has a list where some rows are empty. the x is 3, which is found in the third row (index 2) at column 2.

now, looking at the code provided:

the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. it then iterates over each row (i) in lst. for each row, it iterates over the columns in reverse order, starting from the last index (j = lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. for each element, if it equals x, it appends a vector {i, j} to out.

wait a minute, the code is iterating columns in reverse order, so for each row, the columns are added starting from the highest index to the lowest. so for a row, the first occurrence added is the last column where x appears, then the previous ones. but when the final output is returned, the rows are in order, but within each row, the columns are in descending order. so that seems correct.

but let's think about the sorting. the code doesn't explicitly sort the output. it just appends the coordinates in the order it finds them. so for each row, it's processing columns from high to low, which means for that row, the coordinates are added in descending column order. but what about the rows themselves? since the outer loop is from i=0 to lst.size()-1, the rows are processed in ascending order. so the final out vector should have all the coordinates ordered correctly: rows in ascending order, and within each row, columns in descending order.

wait, but in the first example, the output is {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}. let's see how the code would process this.

in the first row (i=0), the elements are 1,2,3,4,5,6. so j starts at 5, then 4, etc. the first element is 1 at j=0. so when j=0, it's added as {0,0}.

in the second row (i=1), elements are 1,2,3,4,1,6. so j starts at 5 (element 6, not 1), then 4 (element 1). so {1,4} is added. then j=3,2,1,0. at j=0, element is 1, so {1,0} is added. so the order for row 1 is {1,4}, {1,0}.

in the third row (i=2), elements are 1,2,3,4,5,1. so j starts at 5 (element 1), so {2,5} is added. then j=4 (5), j=3 (4), j=2 (3), j=1 (2), j=0 (1). so {2,0} is added. so the order for row 2 is {2,5}, {2,0}.

so the out vector becomes:
{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}.

which matches the expected output.

another test case: get_row({{}, {1}, {1,2,3}}, 3). the code should process each row:

i=0: row is empty, nothing added.

i=1: row has one element, 1. not equal to 3, so nothing.

i=2: row has elements 1,2,3. j starts at 2 (element 3), which equals x=3. so {2,2} is added. then j=1, j=0, which are 2 and 1, not 3. so the output is {{2,2}}, which is correct.

another test case: get_row({}, 1) returns empty, which is correct.

so the code seems to handle all these cases correctly.

wait, but what about a case where in a row, x appears multiple times, but not in the first or last positions. for example, row is {5,1,3,1,4}. x is 1. so j starts at 4 (element 4, no), 3 (1, yes: {i,3}), then 2 (3, no), 1 (1, yes: {i,1}), 0 (5, no). so the coordinates for this row would be {i,3}, {i,1}, which is correct as 3>1.

so the code correctly appends in descending column order for each row, and rows are processed in order.

therefore, the code should pass the provided assertions.

wait, but looking at the assertion statement given, it's incomplete. the user wrote:

assert (issame(get_row({ ... }, ... )) ... )

but the code seems correct, so any assertion that matches the examples should pass.

so the final result is that the assertion passes.
</think>

the function `get_row` correctly finds all occurrences of `x` in the 2d vector, returning coordinates sorted by rows in ascending order and columns in descending order within each row. the code processes each row from top to bottom and each column from right to left, ensuring the correct order without needing explicit sorting. all test cases are handled properly.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the provided c++ code correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement. the function is supposed to find all occurrences of an integer x in a 2d vector (which is a list of lists) and return their coordinates sorted first by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order within each row.

let me start by understanding the problem statement thoroughly.

the function get_row takes two arguments: a vector of vectors (lst) and an integer x. it should return a vector of vectors, where each inner vector contains the coordinates [row, column] of each occurrence of x in lst. the result should be sorted such that the rows are in ascending order. within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

looking at the examples provided:

1. the first example:
   input: lst is a 3x6 matrix where each row has 6 elements. x is 1.
   the output is {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}.
   let's break this down:
   - row 0 has 1 at column 0.
   - row 1 has 1 at columns 4 and 0.
   - row 2 has 1 at columns 5 and 0.
   so, for each row, the columns are listed in descending order. so row 1 has 4 and 0, which is correct because 4>0. similarly, row 2 has 5>0.

2. the second example:
   input is an empty lst, so the output is empty.

3. the third example:
   input is a list where the third row has elements {1,2,3}, and x is 3. so the only occurrence is at row 2, column 2.

now, looking at the provided code:

the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then, it iterates over each row (i) of lst. for each row, it iterates over the columns in reverse order (starting from the last index down to 0). for each element, if it equals x, it appends a vector {i, j} to out.

wait, but the way the code is written, for each row, it's adding the columns in reverse order. so for row 1 in the first example, the code would find j=4 first, then j=0. so the order within the row is 4,0, which is correct because it's descending.

but when the code collects all these, the overall order is first by row (since i increases from 0 upwards), and within each row, the columns are added in descending order. so the code seems to be correctly building the output vector in the required order.

wait, but let's think about how the code is structured. for each row i, it loops j from the end to the beginning. so for each row, it appends the coordinates in the order of highest column to lowest. so for row 0, it appends (0,0) because that's the only occurrence. for row 1, it appends (1,4) first, then (1,0). for row 2, it appends (2,5) then (2,0). so the output vector would be in the order 0,0; 1,4; 1,0; 2,5; 2,0. which matches the first example.

so the code seems to correctly handle the sorting as per the problem statement.

wait, but what about when multiple rows have the same i? for example, if a row has multiple x's, they are added in the order of highest column first. so the code correctly sorts within the row in descending order.

now, let's think about the test cases.

first test case in the problem statement:

get_row({
  {1,2,3,4,5,6},
  {1,2,3,4,1,6},
  {1,2,3,4,5,1}
}, 1) should return {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}.

the code would process each row:

row 0: j starts at 5, goes down to 0. at j=0, the value is 1, so adds (0,0).

row 1: j=5 is 6, not 1. j=4 is 1, so adds (1,4). then j=3 is 4, no. j=2 is 3, no. j=1 is 2, no. j=0 is 1, adds (1,0).

row 2: j=5 is 1, adds (2,5). then j=4 is 5, no. j=3 is 4, no. j=2 is 3, no. j=1 is 2, no. j=0 is 1, adds (2,0).

so the output vector is as expected.

second test case: get_row({}, 1) returns empty. the code correctly returns an empty vector.

third test case: get_row({{}, {1}, {1,2,3}}, 3). the code loops through each row:

row 0: empty, so no elements.

row 1: j starts at 0 (since size is 1). lst[1][0] is 1, not 3.

row 2: j starts at 2 (since size is 3). lst[2][2] is 3, so adds (2,2). then j=1 and 0 are checked but not equal to 3.

so the output is {{2,2}}, which matches the example.

now, looking at the assertion statement provided:

the user wrote:

assert (issame(get_row({ ... }), ... ));

but the code provided seems to correctly handle the examples. so the assertion should pass.

wait, but perhaps i should check if the code handles all possible cases correctly.

another test case: what if a row has multiple x's in various columns?

for example, lst = { {5,1,3,1,2}, {1,4} }, x=1.

the expected output should be:

row 0: columns 3,1 (since 3>1) → (0,3), (0,1).

row 1: column 0 → (1,0).

so the output should be { {0,3}, {0,1}, {1,0} }.

the code would process row 0: j=4 (element 2, no), j=3 (1, yes → add (0,3)), j=2 (3, no), j=1 (1, yes → add (0,1)), j=0 (5, no). so row 0's entries are added in order 3,1.

row 1: j=1 (4, no), j=0 (1, yes → add (1,0)).

so the output is as expected.

another test case: what if a row has x in the middle?

lst = { {2,1,3,1,4} }, x=1.

the code would process j=4 (4, no), j=3 (1, yes → add (0,3)), j=2 (3, no), j=1 (1, yes → add (0,1)), j=0 (2, no). so the output is { {0,3}, {0,1} }, which is correct.

so the code seems to handle all these cases correctly.

therefore, the provided code should pass the given assertion.
</think>

the code correctly implements the function as described. it iterates through each row and within each row, checks columns in reverse order, ensuring that the coordinates are added in the required order. all test cases are handled properly.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to figure out whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c++ code. let me start by understanding the problem and the code.

the function get_row takes a 2d vector (lst) and an integer x. it's supposed to find all occurrences of x in the nested vectors and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors. each coordinate is {row, column}, starting from 0. the result should be sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

looking at the examples:

1. in the first example, the input is a 3x6 matrix. the function is called with x=1. the output is {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}. let me check why.

- row 0: elements are 1,2,3,4,5,6. so 1 is at column 0.
- row 1: elements are 1,2,3,4,1,6. so 1 is at columns 0 and 4.
- row 2: elements are 1,2,3,4,5,1. so 1 is at columns 0 and 5.

so the coordinates are (0,0), (1,4), (1,0), (2,5), (2,0). but wait, in the output, they are ordered as 0,0 comes first, then 1,4, then 1,0, then 2,5, then 2,0. so within each row, the columns are in descending order. so for row 1, 4 comes before 0, and for row 2, 5 comes before 0.

now, looking at the code:

the code initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then it loops through each row (i from 0 to lst.size()-1). for each row, it loops j from the end of the row (lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. so for each element, starting from the last column moving to the first, it checks if lst[i][j] == x. if so, it appends {i,j} to out.

wait, so for each row, the j loop starts from the highest index and goes down. so in row 0, j starts at 5, goes down to 0. so when it finds 1 at j=0, it adds (0,0). then in row 1, j starts at 5, goes down. so when j=4, it finds 1, adds (1,4), then when j=0, adds (1,0). similarly for row 2, j=5 is 1, so adds (2,5), then j=0 is 1, adds (2,0).

so the order in which the coordinates are added to 'out' is (0,0), (1,4), (1,0), (2,5), (2,0). which matches the expected output.

so the code seems to correctly handle the first example.

another example: get_row({}, 1) returns empty, which is correct because the input is empty.

third example: get_row({{}, {1}, {1,2,3}}, 3). the function should return {{2,2}}. let's see.

the input is a list with three rows. first row is empty, so no elements. second row has one element, 1. third row has 1,2,3. so x=3 is in row 2, column 2 (since indexing starts at 0). so the output should be {{2,2}}.

in the code, for i=0, the row is empty, so j loop doesn't run. for i=1, the row has size 1, so j starts at 0, checks if 1 ==3? no. so nothing added. for i=2, the row has size 3, j starts at 2, checks if 3 ==3? yes, adds {2,2}. so the output is correct.

now, looking at the assertion statement provided: it's incomplete. the user wrote:

assert (issame(get_row({ ... })), but didn't finish it. so perhaps the assertion is testing one of the examples.

but since the code seems to handle the examples correctly, i think the assertion would pass.

wait, but perhaps i should check the code more carefully.

wait, the code is written as:

for (int i=0; i<lst.size(); i++)
    for (int j=lst[i].size()-1; j>=0; j-=1)
        if (lst[i][j] == x) out.push_back({i,j});

so for each row, it's iterating from the end to the beginning, adding the coordinates in reverse column order. so for a row, the columns are added in descending order. so within each row, the columns are in descending order, which is correct.

then, the rows are processed in order 0,1,2,... so the overall list is ordered by row in ascending order.

so the code should produce the correct output.

therefore, any assertion that tests the examples should pass.

so the final result is that the assertion passes.
</think>

the code correctly implements the required functionality. it iterates through each row and within each row, checks columns from last to first, ensuring that the coordinates are added in the correct order. the examples provided are handled correctly, so the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails. the assertion is checking if the function get_row returns an empty vector when called with an empty vector and x=1.

first, let me look at the function get_row. it takes a vector of vectors lst and an integer x. it initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then it loops through each row in lst using a for loop with index i. for each row, it loops through each element, but it's iterating from the end to the beginning—so j starts at lst[i].size()-1 and goes down to 0. for each element, if it equals x, it adds the coordinate {i,j} to out.

now, the assertion is get_row({}, 1) should return {}. let's see what happens when lst is empty. the outer loop runs for i from 0 to lst.size()-1. since lst is empty, lst.size() is 0, so the loop doesn't run at all. therefore, out remains empty, which is what the assertion expects.

so the function should return an empty vector in this case, making the assertion pass.
</think>

the function correctly returns an empty vector when the input list is empty, so the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding the problem and the code.

the function in question is called get_row, which takes a vector of vectors (lst) and an integer x. it's supposed to find all occurrences of x in the nested vectors and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors. each coordinate is {row, column}, starting from 0. the result should be sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

looking at the examples provided:

1. the first example has a 3-row matrix. for x=1, it finds all the 1s and returns their coordinates. the output is ordered by row, and within each row, the columns are in descending order. so for row 0, column 0 is the only occurrence, so it's first. for row 1, the 1s are at columns 4 and 0, so they are ordered as 4 then 0. similarly for row 2.

2. the second example is an empty list, so the output is empty.

3. the third example has a list where some rows are empty. it looks for x=3 and finds it in row 2, column 2.

now, looking at the code:

the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then, it loops through each row (i from 0 to lst.size()-1). for each row, it loops through the columns in reverse order (j starts from the end of the row and goes down to 0). if the element at [i][j] equals x, it adds the coordinate {i, j} to out.

wait, so the columns are being checked from the end to the beginning. that means for each row, the first occurrence found is the last column, then the second last, etc. so when adding to the output, the coordinates for a row are added in reverse column order. but the problem requires that within a row, the columns are sorted in descending order. so this approach should be correct because we're checking from the end to the start, so the first match in the loop is the highest column index, then next, etc.

so the code seems to correctly collect the coordinates in the required order.

now, the assertion given is:

assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));

so the input is a vector containing a single row, which is {1}, and x is 2. the function should return an empty vector because 2 is not present in the input.

let me walk through the code with this input.

lst is {{1}}, so lst.size() is 1. so i will be 0.

for row 0, j starts at lst[0].size()-1, which is 0 (since the row has one element). so j is 0.

check if lst[0][0] == 2. lst[0][0] is 1, which is not equal to 2. so no coordinates are added to out.

so the function returns an empty vector, which matches the expected result of the assertion.

therefore, the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me think again. the code loops j from the end to the start, but in this case, the row has only one element. so j is 0, and the condition is false. so nothing is added. so yes, the output is empty.

so the assertion is correct, and the function returns the expected empty vector. therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the assertion checks if the function correctly returns an empty vector when the target value is not present. since the function doesn't find the value, it returns an empty vector, making the assertion pass.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) , {{2, 2}}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the code is supposed to do.

the function get_row takes a 2d vector (lst) and an integer x. it's supposed to find all occurrences of x in the nested vectors and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors. each coordinate is {row, column}, starting from 0. the result should be sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

looking at the examples provided:

1. the first example has a 3x6 matrix. when searching for 1, the output includes coordinates from each row where 1 appears. the columns are ordered from highest to lowest within each row. so for row 0, 1 is at column 0. for row 1, it's at columns 4 and 0. for row 2, it's at 5 and 0. so the output is ordered as {0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}.

2. the second example is an empty list, so the output is empty.

3. the third example is a list where some rows are empty. the function is called with x=3, and the output is {{2,2}} because in the third row (index 2), the element at index 2 is 3.

now, looking at the code:

the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. it then iterates over each row (i from 0 to lst.size()-1). for each row, it iterates j from the end of the row (lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. for each element, if it equals x, it appends {i,j} to out.

wait, but the way the code is written, for each row, it's adding the coordinates in reverse order of columns. so for a row, the first occurrence found is the last column, then the one before, etc. so within a row, the columns are added in descending order. that's correct as per the problem statement.

now, the assertion given is:

assert (issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) , {{2, 2}}));

so the input is a list with three rows:
- row 0: empty.
- row 1: {1}.
- row 2: {1,2,3}.

we're searching for x=3. let's see where 3 appears. it's in row 2, column 2 (since indexing starts at 0). so the expected output is {{2,2}}.

let's see what the code does. it loops through each row:

i=0: the row is empty, so j loop doesn't run. nothing added.

i=1: the row has one element, j starts at 0. the element is 1, which is not 3. so nothing added.

i=2: the row has 3 elements. j starts at 2, then 1, then 0.

at j=2: element is 3, which matches x. so {2,2} is added to out.

then j=1: element is 2, no match.

j=0: element is 1, no match.

so the out vector is {{2,2}}, which matches the expected result.

therefore, the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me double-check the code. the code is written as:

for (int i=0; i<lst.size(); i++)
    for (int j=lst[i].size()-1; j>=0; j-=1)
        if (lst[i][j] == x) out.push_back({i,j});

yes, that's correct. so for each row, it's checking from the last column to the first, adding each occurrence in reverse column order. so within a row, the columns are in descending order.

in the assertion case, there's only one occurrence, so the output is correct.

so the assertion should pass.
</think>

the code correctly finds the occurrence of x=3 in the third row at column 2 and returns the expected result.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
