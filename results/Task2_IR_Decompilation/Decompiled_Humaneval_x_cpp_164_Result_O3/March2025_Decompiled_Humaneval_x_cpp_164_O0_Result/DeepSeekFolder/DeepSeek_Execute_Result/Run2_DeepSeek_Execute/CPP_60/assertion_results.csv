assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the assertion `assert(sum_to_n(1) == 1);` passes or fails based on the given c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to sum numbers from 1 to n. the examples given in the comments show that for n=30, the result is 465, which i know is correct because the sum of the first 30 natural numbers is indeed 30*31/2 = 465. similarly, for n=100, it's 5050, which is correct. so the function seems to be using the formula n*(n+1)/2, which is the standard formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers.

now, the function is implemented as `return n*(n+1)/2;`. let me check if this works correctly for n=1. plugging in 1, it becomes 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. so the function should return 1 when n is 1.

the assertion is checking if `sum_to_n(1)` equals 1. since the function correctly returns 1, the assertion should pass. i don't see any issues here. the code uses integer division, but since 2 divides evenly into 2 when n=1, there's no problem with integer truncation in this case.

wait, but in c++, the division of two integers results in an integer. so for n=1, 1*(1+1) is 2, divided by 2 is 1, which is correct. so yes, the function returns 1, and the assertion should pass.

i don't think there are any edge cases here because n=1 is the smallest possible positive integer input. the function handles it correctly. so the assertion should definitely pass.

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula n*(n+1)/2. for n=1, this results in 1, which matches the assertion. therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion `assert(sum_to_n(6) == 21);` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me think through this step by step.

first, i'll look at the function `sum_to_n`. it's supposed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. the code uses the formula `n*(n+1)/2` to compute this sum. i remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by this formula, so that seems correct.

now, the assertion is checking if `sum_to_n(6)` equals 21. let me compute what the function returns when n is 6. plugging into the formula: 6*(6+1)/2. that's 6*7=42, divided by 2 is 21. so the function should return 21 when given 6.

wait, but i should make sure about the data types and any possible integer overflow. the function returns an int, and for n=6, 6*7 is 42, which is well within the range of int. so no issues there.

so the function returns 21, and the assertion is checking for equality with 21. therefore, the assertion should pass.

i don't see any mistakes in the function or the calculation. so the result should be a pass.
</think>

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first 6 natural numbers using the formula, resulting in 21. the assertion checks for this value and thus passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion `assert(sum_to_n(11) == 66)` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. the formula used is `n*(n+1)/2`. i remember that this is the standard formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. so, for example, when n is 5, the sum is 15, which matches the sample given.

now, the assertion is checking if `sum_to_n(11)` equals 66. let me compute this manually. using the formula, 11 multiplied by (11 + 1) is 11*12, which is 132. dividing that by 2 gives 66. so according to the formula, the function should return 66 when n is 11.

i should also consider any potential issues with the code. the function returns an integer, and the calculation is done using integer arithmetic. let me check if there's any possibility of integer overflow or division issues. for n=11, 11*12 is 132, which is well within the range of a 32-bit integer, so no overflow here. the division by 2 is exact, so no rounding issues either.

wait, but in c++, the order of operations matters. the multiplication happens before the division because of operator precedence. so n*(n+1) is computed first, then divided by 2. that's correct because the formula requires adding 1 to n before multiplying.

so putting it all together, when n is 11, the function returns 66, which matches the assertion. therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. for n=11, the calculation is 11*12/2 = 66, which matches the assertion.

assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion `assert(sum_to_n(30) == 465)` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. the formula used is `n*(n+1)/2`. i remember that this is the standard formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. so, for example, when n is 5, the sum is 15, which matches the sample given.

now, the assertion is checking if `sum_to_n(30)` equals 465. let me compute this manually. using the formula: 30 multiplied by 31 is 930, and then divided by 2 gives 465. so, the function should return 465 when n is 30.

i should also check if there are any potential issues with the code. the function returns an integer, and since 30 and 31 are both integers, their product is 930, which is even, so dividing by 2 gives an integer without any loss. there's no overflow issue here because 30 is a small number, and 30*31 is well within the range of a 32-bit integer.

wait, but in c++, the multiplication of two integers could cause integer overflow if n is very large, but for n=30, that's not a problem. so the calculation should be correct.

therefore, when the function is called with 30, it should correctly return 465, making the assertion pass.
</think>

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first 30 natural numbers using the formula, resulting in 465. the assertion checks for this value and passes.

assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the assertion `assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to sum numbers from 1 to n. the examples given in the comments show that for n=30, the result is 465, which i know is correct because 30*31/2 is 465. similarly, for n=100, the expected result is 5050, which is a well-known sum.

the function `sum_to_n` is implemented using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. that makes sense because the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by that formula. so for n=100, it should calculate 100*101/2.

let me compute that manually. 100 multiplied by 101 is 10100. dividing that by 2 gives 5050. so the function should return 5050 when n is 100.

now, looking at the assertion: it checks if `sum_to_n(100)` equals 5050. since the function correctly computes this, the assertion should pass.

i don't see any issues with the code. the formula is correct, and the calculation for 100 is accurate. so the assertion result should be pass.

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. for n=100, this results in 5050, which matches the assertion.
