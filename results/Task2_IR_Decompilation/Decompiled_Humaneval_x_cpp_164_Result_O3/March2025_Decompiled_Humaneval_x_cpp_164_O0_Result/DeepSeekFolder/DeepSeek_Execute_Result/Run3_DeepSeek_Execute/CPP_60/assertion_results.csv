assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion `assert(sum_to_n(1) == 1)` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to sum numbers from 1 to n. the formula used is `n*(n+1)/2`. that makes sense because the sum of the first n natural numbers is a well-known formula. 

so, when n is 1, the function should return 1. let me plug in n=1 into the formula. 1*(1+1)/2 equals 2/2, which is 1. so the calculation seems correct.

now, checking the assertion: it's checking if `sum_to_n(1)` equals 1. since the function returns 1 when n is 1, the assertion should pass.

i don't see any issues with the code. the formula is correct, and the calculation for n=1 is accurate. therefore, the assertion should pass without any problems.

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. for n=1, the result is 1, which matches the assertion.

assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion `assert(sum_to_n(6) == 21);` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to sum numbers from 1 to n. the formula used is `n*(n+1)/2`. i remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by this formula, so that makes sense.

now, the assertion is checking if `sum_to_n(6)` equals 21. let me compute this manually. the sum from 1 to 6 is 1+2+3+4+5+6. adding these up: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15, plus 6 is 21. so the expected result is 21.

using the formula, for n=6: 6*(6+1)/2 = 6*7/2 = 42/2 = 21. so the function should return 21 when given 6 as input.

therefore, the assertion `sum_to_n(6) == 21` should evaluate to true, meaning the assertion passes.
</think>

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. for n=6, the sum is 21, so the assertion passes.

assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the assertion sum_to_n(11) == 66 passes or fails. let me start by understanding what the function sum_to_n does. from the code provided, it's supposed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. 

looking at the code, the function uses the formula n*(n+1)/2. i remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by this formula, so that makes sense. 

now, the assertion is checking if sum_to_n(11) equals 66. let me compute that manually. for n=11, the sum should be 1+2+3+...+11. let me add these up step by step. 

1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15, plus 6 is 21, plus 7 is 28, plus 8 is 36, plus 9 is 45, plus 10 is 55, and finally plus 11 gives 66. so the expected result is 66.

wait, but let me double-check using the formula. plugging n=11 into n*(n+1)/2: 11*12 is 132, divided by 2 is 66. yep, that's correct.

so the function should return 66 when given 11. therefore, the assertion should pass because both the function's calculation and the manual sum give the same result.

i don't see any issues with the code. it's a straightforward implementation of the formula, and the test case seems valid. so i'm confident the assertion will pass.
</think>

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first 11 natural numbers using the formula, resulting in 66. the assertion checks for this value and thus passes.

                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the assertion `assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to sum numbers from 1 to n. the examples given in the comments show that for n=30, the result is 465, which i remember is the correct sum because 30*31/2 equals 465. so the function uses the formula n*(n+1)/2, which is the standard formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers.

now, the assertion is checking if sum_to_n(30) equals 465. let me compute what the function returns when n is 30. using the formula: 30 multiplied by 31 is 930, and dividing that by 2 gives 465. so the function should return 465 when given 30 as input.

wait, but i should also consider if there's any possible issue with integer division in c++. since both n and n+1 are integers, their product is an even number because either n or n+1 is even. so dividing by 2 should give an integer result without any loss. for n=30, 30 is even, so 30*31 is 930, which divided by 2 is exactly 465. so there's no problem with integer division here.

i don't see any other issues in the code. the function is straightforward and correctly implements the sum formula. therefore, when the assertion is run, sum_to_n(30) will indeed return 465, making the assertion true.

so the assertion should pass without any problems.

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first 30 natural numbers using the formula, resulting in 465. the assertion checks for this value and will pass.

assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the assertion `assert(sum_to_n(100) == 5050);` passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let me start by understanding what the function `sum_to_n` does.

looking at the code, the function is supposed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. the formula used is `n*(n+1)/2`. i remember that this is the standard formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. so, for example, when n is 5, the sum is 15, which matches the sample given.

now, the assertion is checking if `sum_to_n(100)` equals 5050. let me compute this manually using the formula. 

calculating 100 * (100 + 1) gives 100 * 101 = 10100. dividing that by 2 gives 5050. so according to the formula, the function should return 5050 when n is 100.

but wait, i should consider the data types and possible integer overflow. the function returns an `int`, and in c++, the size of an int can vary, but it's typically 32 bits. let me check what 100 * 101 is as an integer. 100 is within the range of a 32-bit int, which can handle up to around 2 billion. so 100 * 101 is 10100, which is way below that limit. dividing by 2 gives 5050, which is still within the int range.

so, the calculation should be correct. the function doesn't have any loops or other operations that might cause issues. it's a straightforward formula. therefore, when the function is called with 100, it should return 5050, making the assertion pass.

i don't see any errors in the code. the formula is correct, and the calculation for n=100 is accurate. so the assertion should pass without any problems.

the function `sum_to_n` correctly calculates the sum of the first 100 natural numbers using the formula, resulting in 5050. the assertion checks for this value and will pass.
