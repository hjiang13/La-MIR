assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to analyze whether the provided c++ code correctly implements the function as described by the problem statement. the function is supposed to find all occurrences of an integer x in a 2d vector (which is a list of lists) and return their coordinates sorted first by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order within each row.

let me look at the examples given to understand the expected behavior.

first example:
input: a 3x6 matrix where each row has 6 elements. the value x is 1.
the expected output is {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}.
looking at each row:
- row 0 has 1 at column 0.
- row 1 has 1 at columns 0 and 4.
- row 2 has 1 at columns 0 and 5.

so the output lists all these coordinates. now, the order is sorted by row (0,1,2), and within each row, the columns are in descending order. so for row 1, 4 comes before 0. for row 2, 5 comes before 0.

second example:
input is an empty list, so the output is empty.

third example:
input is a list containing three rows: an empty row, a row with 1, and a row with 1,2,3. x is 3.
the output is {{2,2}} because 3 is at row 2, column 2.

now, looking at the code provided:

the function get_row takes a vector of vectors lst and an integer x. it initializes an empty vector of vectors out. then it loops through each row i from 0 to lst.size()-1. for each row, it loops j from the end of the row (lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. if lst[i][j] equals x, it appends {i,j} to out.

so the code is iterating each row, and within each row, it's checking columns from the last to the first. so for each row, the columns are added in reverse order, which would be descending order as required.

wait, but the problem says to sort the coordinates initially by rows in ascending order, which the code does by iterating i from 0 upwards. then, within each row, the columns are added in descending order because j starts from the end and goes down. so for each row, the columns are added from high to low, which is correct.

so the code seems to correctly collect the coordinates in the required order.

let me test the first example:

in the first example, for row 0, j starts at 5 and goes down. the first occurrence is at j=0, so it's added. then for row 1, j starts at 5, goes down. the 1 is at j=4 and j=0. so when j=4 is found, it's added first, then j=0 is added later. so in the output, row 1's entries are {1,4}, {1,0}, which is correct.

similarly, for row 2, j starts at 5, finds 1 at j=5, adds {2,5}, then j=0, adds {2,0}.

so the output is ordered correctly.

another test case: the third example. the code loops through each row. for row 0, which is empty, nothing is added. row 1 has one element, which is 1, not equal to 3, so nothing. row 2 has elements 1,2,3. j starts at 2 (since size is 3, j starts at 2, then 1, then 0). at j=2, the value is 3, so {2,2} is added. so the output is correct.

what about a case where a row has multiple x's in various positions? for example, if a row has x at columns 3, 1, 4. the code would process j from high to low, so j=4 is checked first, then 3, then 2, etc. so the x at 4 is added first, then 3, then 1. so the order within the row is 4,3,1, which is descending.

wait, but in the code, for each row, it's looping j from the end down to 0. so for a row with elements [5,1,3,1,4], x=1. the j loop would check j=4 (value 4, not 1), j=3 (1, so add {i,3}), j=2 (3, no), j=1 (1, add {i,1}), j=0 (5, no). so the coordinates added are {i,3}, {i,1}, which is in descending order of columns.

yes, that's correct.

so the code seems to correctly handle all cases.

now, looking at the assertion statement provided:

the user wrote ""assert (issame(get_row({"" but it's incomplete. i think the assertion is to test the function against the examples.

but since the code correctly handles the examples, the assertion should pass.

wait, but perhaps i should check for possible issues.

one possible issue is that the code is using vectors of vectors of int. so when x is an integer, the comparison is correct.

another point: in c++, when the inner vector is empty, like in the third example, the code correctly skips it because j starts at lst[i].size()-1, which is -1 when the size is 0. so the inner loop doesn't run, which is correct.

another test case: what if x is not present in any row? then the function returns an empty vector, which is correct.

what about if a row has multiple x's, but in the same column? well, that's impossible since each column in a row is unique. so no problem.

so overall, the code seems to correctly implement the required functionality.
</think>

the code correctly implements the function as described. it iterates through each row and within each row, checks columns from last to first, ensuring that the coordinates are collected in the required order. all test cases are handled properly.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the provided c++ code correctly implements the function as per the given examples. the function is called get_row and it's supposed to return a vector of coordinates where the integer x is found in a 2d vector (lst). the coordinates should be sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, sorted by column in descending order.

let me look at the code first. the function loops through each row of the input vector. for each row, it iterates from the last element to the first (j starts at lst[i].size()-1 and decrements by 1 each time). if the element equals x, it adds the coordinate {i, j} to the output vector.

wait, but in the examples, the output is sorted by row ascending, and within the row, columns are in descending order. so for each row, the code is processing columns from the end to the start, which means for a row, the first occurrence in the output will be the last column where x is found, then the next, etc. so when the same row has multiple x's, their columns are added in reverse order, which would be descending. that seems correct.

let me test the first example:

input:
{
  {1,2,3,4,5,6},
  {1,2,3,4,1,6},
  {1,2,3,4,5,1}
}, x=1

the expected output is {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}.

let's see what the code does.

for row 0: elements are 1,2,3,4,5,6. so j starts at 5, then 4, etc. the first element is 1 at j=0. so when j=0, it's added as {0,0}. so row 0 has one coordinate.

row 1: elements are 1,2,3,4,1,6. so j starts at 5 (element 6, not 1), then 4 (element 1, so add {1,4}), then 3 (4), 2 (3), 1 (2), 0 (1, so add {1,0}).

so the row 1's coordinates are added in the order 4, then 0. so in the output, they appear as {1,4}, {1,0}.

row 2: elements are 1,2,3,4,5,1. so j starts at 5 (element 1, add {2,5}), then 4 (5), 3 (4), 2 (3), 1 (2), 0 (1, add {2,0}).

so the row 2's coordinates are added as 5, then 0.

so the output from the code would be:

{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}.

which matches the expected output. so the first example passes.

second example: get_row({}, 1) returns empty vector. the code initializes out as empty, and since lst is empty, the loop doesn't run. so it returns empty, which is correct.

third example: get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) should return {{2,2}}.

let's see. the input is a vector with three rows:

row 0: empty, so nothing is added.

row 1: {1}, so j starts at 0. if x is 3, it's not found, so nothing added.

row 2: {1,2,3}. j starts at 2 (element 3, which is x=3, so add {2,2}).

so the output is {{2,2}}, which matches the expected result.

wait, but in the code, for each row, it's iterating from the end to the beginning. so in row 2, j=2 is checked first, which is 3, so added. then j=1 (2), j=0 (1), which are not 3. so only one coordinate is added.

so the code seems to handle all the examples correctly.

but wait, let me think about the sorting. the code adds the coordinates in the order of rows, and within each row, the columns are processed from last to first. so for a row, the first occurrence in the output is the last column where x is found, then the previous, etc. so the coordinates for a row are in descending order of columns, which is correct.

so the code should pass all the test cases.

wait, but what about when a row has multiple x's in different columns? for example, if a row is {5,1,3,1}, x=1. then the code would process j=3 (1) first, add {i,3}, then j=1 (1), add {i,1}. so the output for that row would be {i,3}, {i,1}, which is correct as per the sorting requirement.

so the code seems to correctly handle the sorting as required.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the code correctly implements the function as per the examples. it processes each row and within each row, checks columns from last to first, ensuring that the coordinates are added in the required order. all test cases pass.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"<think>
okay, i need to analyze whether the provided c++ code correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement. let's start by understanding the problem.

the function get_row takes a 2d vector (lst) and an integer x. it should find all occurrences of x in the nested vectors and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors. each coordinate is {row, column}, starting from 0. the result should be sorted first by row in ascending order, and within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

looking at the examples:

first example:
input: a 3x6 matrix where each row has 6 elements. x is 1.
the output is {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}.
wait, let me check the input. the first row is {1,2,3,4,5,6}, so 1 is at (0,0). the second row is {1,2,3,4,1,6}, so 1s are at (1,0) and (1,4). the third row is {1,2,3,4,5,1}, so 1s are at (2,0) and (2,5). so the output should collect all these points.

but the output is ordered as 0,0; then 1,4; then 1,0; then 2,5; then 2,0. wait, that's not correct because within each row, the columns should be in descending order. so for row 1, the columns are 4 and 0. so in the output, 4 comes before 0. similarly, for row 2, 5 comes before 0.

so the code needs to collect all the coordinates, group them by row, sort each row's columns in descending order, and then sort the rows in ascending order.

now, looking at the code provided:

the code initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then, it loops through each row (i from 0 to lst.size()-1). for each row, it loops j from the end of the row (lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. for each element, if it equals x, it appends {i,j} to out.

wait, so for each row, the code is checking elements starting from the last column to the first. so for row i, the j values are added in descending order. so for row 1, j starts at 5, then 4, etc. so when it finds x at j=4, it adds {1,4}, then later when j=0, adds {1,0}. so in the out vector, the order for row 1 is {1,4}, {1,0}.

but when the code is done, the out vector is built by processing each row in order, and within each row, the j's are added in descending order. so the final out vector is already in the correct order as per the problem statement. because the rows are processed in order 0,1,2, etc., and within each row, the columns are added from high to low.

wait, but in the first example, the code would collect the points in the order:

row 0: j=5 down to 0. so when j=0, it's found and added. so {0,0} is added first.

row 1: j=5 down to 0. so j=4 is found, added as {1,4}, then j=0 is found, added as {1,0}.

row 2: j=5 is found, added as {2,5}, then j=0 is found, added as {2,0}.

so the out vector becomes: {0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}.

which matches the expected output.

another example: get_row({}, 1) returns empty, which is correct.

third example: get_row({{}, {1}, {1,2,3}}, 3). the second row is empty, so nothing. the third row is {1,2,3}, so 3 is at j=2. so the output is {{2,2}}, which is correct.

so the code seems to handle these cases correctly.

wait, but let me think about the loop structure. the outer loop is i from 0 to lst.size()-1, which is correct. the inner loop is j from lst[i].size()-1 down to 0. so for each row, it's checking the last element first, moving to the first. so for each row, the j's are added in descending order.

so the out vector is built correctly, with rows in order, and within each row, the columns are in descending order.

so the code should pass all the test cases.

wait, but what about when a row has multiple x's? like in the first example, row 1 has two x's. the code adds them in the order of j=4 then j=0, which is correct.

another test case: suppose a row has x's at j=3, j=1, j=2. then the code would process j=3 first, add it, then j=2, then j=1. so the order would be 3,2,1, which is correct.

so the code seems to correctly handle the sorting as required.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the code correctly implements the required functionality. it iterates through each row and within each row, checks columns from last to first, ensuring that the coordinates are added in the correct order. thus, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. the assertion is checking if get_row({}, 1) returns an empty vector. 

first, i'll look at the function get_row. it takes a vector of vectors (lst) and an integer x. the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then, it iterates over each row in lst using a for loop with index i. for each row, it iterates over the columns in reverse order, starting from the last element (j = lst[i].size() - 1) down to 0. if the element at lst[i][j] equals x, it adds a vector {i, j} to out.

now, the assertion is get_row({}, 1). let's see what happens when lst is empty. the outer loop runs for i from 0 to lst.size() - 1. since lst is empty, lst.size() is 0, so the loop doesn't execute at all. therefore, the out vector remains empty. 

so, the function returns an empty vector, which matches the expected result of the assertion. hence, the assertion should pass.

i should also consider edge cases. for example, if the input lst is empty, the function correctly returns an empty vector. there's no issue here because the loops don't run, and nothing is added to out.

another test case in the examples is get_row({}, 1) which returns {}, so the code seems to handle empty lst correctly.

therefore, the assertion should pass.
</think>

the assertion checks if calling `get_row` with an empty list and `x=1` returns an empty vector. the function correctly handles an empty input by not entering any loops, resulting in an empty output. thus, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));",pass,"<think>
okay, i need to determine whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's break this down step by step.

first, let's understand what the function get_row is supposed to do. from the problem statement, it takes a 2d vector (lst) and an integer x. it searches for x in each row of the 2d vector. for each occurrence of x, it records the coordinates {row, column}, starting from 0. the result should be a vector of these coordinates. the sorting is done first by row in ascending order, and within each row, by column in descending order.

looking at the code provided:

the function initializes an empty vector of vectors called out. then, it iterates over each row (i) in lst. for each row, it iterates over the columns starting from the last index (j = lst[i].size() - 1) down to 0. for each element, if it equals x, it appends the coordinate {i, j} to out.

wait, but the way the loops are structured might affect the order in which elements are added. let's see: for each row i, j starts from the end and goes down to 0. so for a row like {1, 2, 1}, when x is 1, j would be 2 (value 1), then 0 (value 1). so the coordinates added would be (i,2) and (i,0). so within the same row, the columns are added in descending order, which matches the problem's requirement.

now, looking at the assertion: assert(issame(get_row({{1}}, 2), {}));

so the input is a 2d vector with a single row containing {1}, and x is 2. the function should return an empty vector because 2 is not present in the input.

let's simulate the function's execution:

lst is {{1}}, so lst.size() is 1. i starts at 0.

for i=0, j starts at lst[0].size()-1 which is 0 (since the row has one element). so j=0.

check if lst[0][0] == 2. since lst[0][0] is 1, which is not equal to 2. so no coordinates are added to out.

thus, out remains empty, and the function returns an empty vector.

the assertion is checking if get_row returns an empty vector, which it does. so the assertion should pass.

wait, but let me double-check the code. the function uses a for loop where j starts at the end and decrements. so in this case, j is 0, and it's checked once. since 1 != 2, nothing is added. so yes, the output is empty.

therefore, the assertion should pass because the function correctly returns an empty vector when x is not found.
</think>

the function correctly returns an empty vector when the value is not found, so the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) , {{2, 2}}));",pass,"<think>
okay, so i need to figure out whether the given assertion passes or fails based on the provided c++ code. let's start by understanding what the code is supposed to do.

the function get_row takes a 2d vector (lst) and an integer x. it's supposed to find all occurrences of x in the nested vectors and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors. each coordinate is {row, column}, starting from 0. the result needs to be sorted first by rows in ascending order, and within each row, the columns should be in descending order.

looking at the examples provided:

in the first example, when the input is a 3x6 matrix and x is 1, the output is {{0,0}, {1,4}, {1,0}, {2,5}, {2,0}}. wait, that seems a bit off. let me check: for row 0, the first element is 1, so (0,0). for row 1, the elements are 1 at position 0 and 4. but in the output, it's {1,4} and {1,0}. oh right, because within the same row, the columns are sorted in descending order. so 4 comes before 0. similarly, row 2 has 1s at positions 0 and 5, so {2,5}, {2,0}.

now, the assertion given is:

assert (issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) , {{2, 2}}));

so the input is a vector containing three sub-vectors:
- the first is empty.
- the second is {1}.
- the third is {1,2,3}.

we're looking for x=3. so where is 3 located? it's in the third sub-vector, at index 2. so the coordinate should be (2,2).

let me look at the code to see how it's handled.

the code loops through each row (i from 0 to lst.size()-1). for each row, it loops j from the end (lst[i].size()-1) down to 0. so for each element, it checks if it's equal to x. if yes, it adds {i,j} to the output.

in the case of the third sub-vector {1,2,3}, j starts at 2 (since size is 3, j=2, then 1, then 0). so when j=2, the element is 3, which matches x=3. so it adds {2,2} to out.

so the output should be {{2,2}}, which matches the expected result in the assertion.

wait, but let me think about the loops. for each row, it's iterating j from the end to the beginning. so for row 2, j starts at 2, finds 3, adds it. then j decreases to 1, which is 2, not equal to 3. then j=0, 1, not equal. so only one element is added.

so the function should return {{2,2}}, which is exactly what the assertion expects. therefore, the assertion should pass.

i don't see any issues with the code for this particular case. the function correctly finds the position and adds it in the correct order. so the assertion result should be pass.
</think>

the assertion is checking if the function correctly returns the coordinates of the integer 3 in the given 2d vector. the function iterates through each element, starting from the end of each row, and collects the coordinates where the value matches 3. in this case, it correctly identifies the position (2,2) and returns it, matching the expected result.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
