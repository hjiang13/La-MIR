Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the IR code, I see a function named @_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE. From the naming convention, it seems like this function is checking something about a string, probably related to brackets.

The function takes a single input: a pointer to a std::__cxx11::basic_string. In C++, that's a std::string. So the input is a string.

Now, looking at the code inside the function. It starts by checking if the string's length is zero. If it is, it returns true. Otherwise, it enters a loop where it iterates through each character of the string.

In the loop, it checks each character. If it finds a '<' character, it increments a counter. If it finds a '>', it increments another counter. It keeps track of the number of '<' and '>' encountered. If at any point the number of '>' exceeds the number of '<', it returns false. After processing all characters, if the counts are equal, it returns true; otherwise, false.

So, putting it all together, this function checks if the string has balanced brackets, specifically '<' and '>'. It ensures that every '<' has a corresponding '>' and that they are properly nested.

Now, mapping the IR types to C++ types as per the rules. The input is a pointer to a std::__cxx11::basic_string, which is a std::string. The function returns a boolean.

So, the summary should state that there's one function, which takes a std::string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the string has correct bracketing.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or extra comments. The function's semantic is checking for correct bracketing, so the output should reflect that.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: std::string s. function[1] is checking if the string has correct bracketing on s, and outputs a boolean value indicating if the brackets are balanced.
