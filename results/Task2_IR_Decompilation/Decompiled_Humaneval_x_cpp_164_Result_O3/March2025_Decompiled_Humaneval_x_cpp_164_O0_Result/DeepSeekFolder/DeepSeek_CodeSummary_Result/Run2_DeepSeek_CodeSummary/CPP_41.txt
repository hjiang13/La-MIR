Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding the code provided.

Looking at the IR code, I see that there's a module with a function defined. The function is named @_Z18car_race_collisioni and it takes an i32 parameter %0. The function's body is pretty straightforward: it multiplies %0 by itself and returns the result.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. In this case, the function takes an i32, which in C++ is an integer, typically int. The function returns an i32 as well, so that's also an int.

The user provided an example where they summarized a function that took a vector and a float, so I should follow that pattern. In this case, the function takes one input, which is an integer, and returns an integer after squaring it.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format. The example had "There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: ...". Since this function only takes one input, I'll adjust accordingly.

So, the summary should state that there's 1 function, it takes 1 input (an integer), and it computes the square of that input, returning an integer.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it concise, exactly as the example showed, but adjusted for the number of inputs and the function's operation.

Putting it all together, the summary should clearly describe the function's purpose based on the IR code provided.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int x. function[1] is computing the square of the input x and outputs an integer.
