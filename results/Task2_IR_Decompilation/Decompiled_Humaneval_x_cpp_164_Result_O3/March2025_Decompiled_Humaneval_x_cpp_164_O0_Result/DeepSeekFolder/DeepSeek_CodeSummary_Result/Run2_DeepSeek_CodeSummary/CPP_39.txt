Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code, and I need to summarize it according to the given specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

First, I see that there's a module with a function named @_Z9prime_fibi, which takes an i32 input. The function has some loops and condition checks. I need to figure out what this function does semantically.

Looking at the code, it starts with a phi node for %3, %4, and %5. Phi nodes usually indicate the start of loops where variables are being updated each iteration. The variables %3, %4, and %5 seem to be tracking some values related to the loop.

There's a call to @llvm.assume with a condition that %5 is less than the input %0. This suggests that the loop continues as long as %5 is less than the input. Then, %7 is calculated as the sum of %4 and %3, which reminds me of the Fibonacci sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Next, there's a check if %4 is less than 4. If true, it branches back to the start of the loop; otherwise, it proceeds to another part. This might be checking if the Fibonacci number has reached a certain size.

In the next section, there's a loop that checks if %4 is divisible by %10. If it is, it continues the loop; otherwise, it breaks out. This looks like a primality test. If %4 is not divisible by any number up to its square root, it's a prime.

After that, there's another loop that increments a counter %22 based on whether %4 is prime. Once %22 reaches the input %0, the function returns %4, which would be the nth prime number.

So putting it all together, the function seems to generate Fibonacci numbers and check each for primality until it finds the nth prime, where n is the input. Therefore, the function is finding the nth prime number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Now, according to the output format, I need to state that there's 1 function, which takes 1 input (i32), and it's finding the nth prime in the Fibonacci sequence, returning that prime number.

I should make sure to follow the type mapping rules, but in this case, the input is just an i32, so no complex types to map. The summary should be concise and exactly match the specified format without any extra comments or markdown.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: i32 n. function[1] is finding the nth prime number in the Fibonacci sequence on n, and outputs i32 prime_number.
