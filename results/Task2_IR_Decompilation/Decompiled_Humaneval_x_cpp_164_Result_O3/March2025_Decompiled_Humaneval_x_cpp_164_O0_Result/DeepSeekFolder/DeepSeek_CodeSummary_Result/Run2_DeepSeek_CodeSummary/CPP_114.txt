Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm looking at the provided IR code and need to summarize it according to the given specifications. 

First, I notice that the IR code defines a function `_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE`, which suggests it's a C++ function. The function takes a `vector<long long>` as input. My task is to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents, specifically `% "class.std::vector"*` should be `vector<float> numbers`, but in this case, it's handling `long long`, so I'll adjust accordingly.

The function seems to be calculating the minimum subarray sum. I'll go through the IR code step by step to understand its operations. It loads the vector's data, checks the size, and then processes elements to find the minimum sum. There are loops and condition checks, indicating it's iterating through possible subarrays.

I need to ensure the summary strictly follows the specified format. Since there's only one function, I'll describe it as function[1], taking one input: `vector<long long> numbers`. The function's purpose is to find the minimum subarray sum, so the output is an `i64` value representing this sum.

I must avoid any markdown and stick to the exact format provided, ensuring variable names and types are correctly transcribed. No additional explanations or comments should be included. 

Putting it all together, the summary should clearly state the function's input, its purpose, and the output type.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: vector<long long> numbers. function[1] is finding the minimum subarray sum on numbers and outputs a long long value representing the minimum sum.
