Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the IR code, there's a function named @_Z23greatest_common_divisorii which takes two i32 inputs. The function seems to implement the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. 

The function starts with a loop where it repeatedly applies the remainder operation. It uses phi nodes to update the values of the two numbers in each iteration. The loop continues until the remainder is zero, at which point it returns the non-zero number, which is the GCD.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. The function takes two i32 parameters, which correspond to int in C++. The output is also an i32, so the return type is int.

The user provided an example where a function is described in a specific format. I need to follow that format strictly. The example had one function taking two inputs and performing a specific task, then outputting a result.

So, applying this to the given IR code, the function takes two integers as inputs and computes their GCD, returning an integer result. There's only one function in the code, so the summary should reflect that.

I should make sure not to include any markdown or additional explanations, just the structured summary as per the example. Also, I need to ensure that the variable names and types are correctly transcribed as per the mapping rules, but in this case, the types are straightforward (i32 to int).

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's one function which takes two integers, computes their GCD, and returns an integer.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: int a, int b. function[1] is computing the greatest common divisor of two integers on a, b, and outputs an integer value representing the GCD.
