Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm looking at the provided IR code and need to summarize it according to the given specifications. 

First, I'll examine the IR code to understand what it's doing. The function in question is `_Z15is_simple_powerii`, which takes two `i32` inputs. The function name suggests it's checking if one number is a simple power of the other. 

Looking at the code, it starts by comparing the first input (`%0`) to 0 and 1. If `%0` is greater than 1, it enters a loop. Inside the loop, it multiplies the second input (`%1`) by itself incrementally and checks if it matches `%0`. If at any point the multiplication equals `%0`, it returns true; otherwise, it continues looping. If the loop exits without finding a match, it returns false.

Now, applying the mapping rules, the IR types `i32` should be translated to their C++ equivalents, which is `int`. So, the function takes two `int` parameters. 

The function's purpose is to determine if the first number is a power of the second. It does this by iteratively multiplying the second number and checking against the first, ensuring it doesn't exceed a certain limit (like 99). This is a common method to check for simple powers without using advanced mathematical functions.

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's one function which takes two integers and checks if the first is a power of the second, returning a boolean.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: int base, int exponent. function[1] is checking if the base is a simple power of the exponent on base, exponent, and outputs a boolean value indicating if base is a power of exponent.
