Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the IR code, I see a function named @_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. From the naming convention, this seems to be a C++ function, probably something like sum_squares with a vector of integers as input.

The function takes a single input: a pointer to a std::vector. The IR type is %"class.std::vector"* which, according to the mapping rules, should be translated to vector<int> numbers.

Now, I need to figure out what this function does. It loads the start and end pointers of the vector, calculates the number of elements, and then iterates through each element. For each element, it squares the value and adds it to a running total. There's some handling for different alignment or loop unrolling, but the main operation is summing the squares of the vector elements.

So, the function is summing the squares of each element in the vector and returning the result as an integer.

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's one function which takes a vector<int> as input and outputs the sum of squares of its elements.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: vector<int> numbers. function[1] is summing the squares of each element in the vector and outputs the result as an integer.
