Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding the code.

Looking at the IR code, I see that there's a single function defined: @_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni. It takes an i32 input, which is an integer in C++. The function has some attributes like mustprogress, nofree, etc., but I don't need to focus on those for the summary.

Inside the function, the first operation is %2 = and i32 %0, 1. This is taking the input and doing a bitwise AND with 1, which effectively checks if the least significant bit is 1. So, %2 will be 1 if the input is odd, and 0 if it's even.

Next, %3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0. This is comparing %2 to 0. So, %3 will be true if the input is even, false otherwise.

Then, %4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7. This checks if the input is greater than 7. So, %4 is true if the input is 8 or higher.

Finally, %5 = and i1 %4, %3. This combines the two conditions. So, %5 is true only if both %4 and %3 are true, meaning the input is even and greater than 7.

The function returns %5, which is a boolean value.

Now, mapping the IR types to C++. The input is i32, which is int in C++. The function returns i1, which is bool. So, the function takes an int and returns a bool.

Putting it all together, the function checks if the input is an even number greater than 7. So, the summary should state that there's 1 function, it takes an int input, and it checks if the number is even and greater than 7, returning a boolean.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the format specified, without any markdown or extra comments. The variable names should be as per the example, but in this case, there's only one function with one input.

So, the final summary should be: There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int number. function[1] is checking if the number is even and greater than 7 on number, and outputs a boolean value indicating the result.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int number. function[1] is checking if the number is even and greater than 7 on number, and outputs a boolean value indicating the result.
