Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this IR code according to the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided an example of how to convert IR code into a specific format, and now they want me to do the same for a new piece of IR code.

First, I'll look at the example they gave. The example had one function that took two inputs: a vector of floats and a float threshold. The function's purpose was to check if any two elements in the vector were closer than the threshold. The output was a boolean.

Now, looking at the new IR code provided, I need to identify the functions present. The code starts with a module and some type definitions, then defines a function @_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE. There's also a declaration for @llvm.ceil.f32 and @llvm.umax.i64, but those are intrinsic functions, not part of the main code.

So, the main function is @_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE. Let me break down its name. The prefix @_Z indicates it's a mangled name. Demangling it, I think it translates to something like sum_squares(vector<float>). The function takes a single input, which is a pointer to a vector of floats.

Next, I need to determine what this function does. Looking at the IR code, it seems to be calculating the sum of squares of the elements in the vector. It loads the start and end pointers of the vector, checks if the vector is empty, and if not, it processes the elements in chunks, probably using SIMD instructions. For each element, it takes the ceiling of the value, squares it, and adds it to the sum. Finally, it returns the total sum as an integer.

I also notice that the function has some loop structures, handling different cases based on the vector size, possibly optimizing for different vector lengths. But the core functionality is summing the squares of the ceiling of each element.

Now, applying the user's mapping rules, the input type % "class.std::vector"* should be summarized as vector<float> numbers. Since there's only one input, the function takes just this vector.

Putting it all together, the function takes a vector of floats and computes the sum of the squares of the ceiling of each element, returning an integer result.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or additional comments. So, the summary should state that there's one function, describe its input, and explain its purpose and output.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: vector<float> numbers. function[1] is computing the sum of squares of the ceiling of each element in the vector on numbers and outputs an integer result.
