Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the IR code, there's a function named @_Z4modpii which takes two i32 inputs. The function seems to be implementing a modulus operation, but it's not the standard % operator because it's handling negative numbers and different cases.

The function starts by checking if the first input (%0) is greater than 0. If it is, it proceeds to handle the case where the number is positive. It subtracts 1 from %0 and checks if the result is less than 3. Depending on that, it either proceeds to handle small numbers or aligns the number to a multiple of 4.

There are loops in the code that seem to be shifting and taking the remainder repeatedly. This suggests that the function is calculating the modulus by successively shifting and subtracting, which is a common method in bitwise operations.

The function has multiple labels and branches, indicating conditional logic based on the values of %0 and %1. It uses phi nodes to handle values across different branches, which is typical in SSA form.

Now, applying the user's mapping rules, the IR types should be converted to their C++ equivalents. Since the inputs are i32, they map directly to int in C++. The function doesn't use any complex types like vectors, so the mapping is straightforward.

The function's purpose is to compute the modulus of two integers, handling both positive and negative cases correctly. The output is an integer result of this modulus operation.

So, summarizing this, there's one function that takes two integers and returns an integer after performing the modulus operation, handling various cases to ensure correctness.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: i32 a, i32 b. function[1] is computing the modulus of two integers on a, b, and outputs an integer result.
