Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code that the user provided. My task is to summarize it according to specific guidelines. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the code is doing. The IR code defines a function named @_Z3addii, which takes two i32 inputs and returns their sum. It's pretty straightforwardâ€”just a simple addition.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I have to summarize the code in a particular format. The output should state the number of functions, the inputs each function takes, what the function does semantically, and what it outputs.

Looking at the example provided, the summary starts with "There is [n] function in the code:" and then for each function, it describes the inputs and the operation. So in this case, there's only one function.

The function @_Z3addii takes two i32 parameters, which are integers. It adds them together using the 'add nsw i32' instruction and returns the result. So semantically, it's performing addition on the two integers.

I also need to make sure I'm following the type and variable name mapping rules. The example shows that IR types are mapped to their C++ equivalents. Here, i32 corresponds to int in C++. So the inputs are two integers, and the output is their sum as an integer.

I should avoid any markdown and stick strictly to the specified format. No extra comments or explanations, just the facts. So the summary should be concise and exactly match the example's structure.

Putting it all together, the function takes two integers, adds them, and returns the result. Therefore, the summary should reflect that clearly and succinctly.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: i32 %0, i32 %1. function[1] is adding the two integers on %0, %1, and outputs i32 %3.
