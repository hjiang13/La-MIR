Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code that the user provided. I need to summarize it according to their specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

First, I see that there's a module with some target settings, but the main part is the function definition. The function is named @_Z8sum_to_ni and it takes an i32 parameter %0. The function has several attributes like mustprogress, nofree, etc., which probably relate to optimization or behavior.

Looking at the function body, it starts by adding 1 to %0 and storing it in %2. Then it multiplies %2 by %0 and stores the result in %3. After that, it does a signed division of %3 by 2 and returns that value as %4.

So, putting that together, the function is calculating the sum of the first n integers. The formula used is n*(n+1)/2, which is the standard formula for the sum of an arithmetic series from 1 to n.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. In this case, the function takes an i32, which is a 32-bit integer, so in C++ that's an int. The return type is also i32, so that's another int.

The function doesn't have any complex structures like vectors or pointers, so the mapping is straightforward. The function takes one input, an integer, performs the calculation, and returns an integer.

I need to make sure the summary follows the exact format specified. The example provided by the user shows that each function is described with the number of inputs and their types, followed by what the function does and its output.

So, in this case, there's only one function. It takes one input, an int n. The function calculates the sum of the first n integers using the formula n*(n+1)/2 and returns the result as an int.

I should avoid any markdown and keep it concise, exactly as the user demonstrated. No extra comments or explanations, just the facts in the specified structure.

Double-checking the IR code to ensure I didn't miss anything. The function is indeed simple, with no loops or conditionals, just arithmetic operations. So the summary should reflect that simplicity.

Alright, I think I have everything I need to craft the correct summary as per the user's instructions.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int n. function[1] is calculating the sum of the first n integers using the formula n*(n+1)/2 on n, and outputs an integer value representing the sum.
