Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the IR code, there's a function named @_Z15is_simple_powerii. It takes two i32 inputs, which are integers. The function seems to be checking if the first integer is a simple power of the second. 

In the code, there's a loop that multiplies the second number by itself multiple times and checks if it equals the first number. If it does, it returns true; otherwise, after a certain number of iterations, it returns false. 

So, the function is checking whether the first number is a power of the second. For example, if the inputs are 8 and 2, it returns true because 2^3=8. If the inputs are 10 and 2, it returns false because 2^3=8 and 2^4=16, neither of which is 10.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to C++ types. The function takes two i32 parameters, which in C++ are integers. So, the function takes two integers as inputs.

The output is a boolean value (i1 in IR) indicating whether the first number is a simple power of the second.

Putting it all together, the function is named is_simple_power, takes two integers, and returns a boolean. The summary should state that it checks if the first number is a simple power of the second.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or extra comments. So, the final summary should be concise and match the example provided.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: i32 a, i32 b. function[1] is checking if a is a simple power of b on a, b, and outputs a boolean value indicating if a is a power of b.
