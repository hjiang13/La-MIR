Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.

First, the user provided an IR code snippet and wants a summary in a specific format. The output should list the number of functions, each function's inputs, and what it does, following the example they gave. They also provided mapping rules for types and variable names, especially handling vector types.

Looking at the IR code, I see there's a single function defined: @_Z6x_or_yiii. It takes three i32 inputs, which in C++ would be integers. The function has some conditional checks and loops, but the key is to map the IR types to C++ types as per the rules.

The function's name in IR is @_Z6x_or_yiii, which when demangled would be something like x_or_y. It takes three integers, so the inputs are i32 %0, i32 %1, i32 %2. According to the mapping rules, these should be summarized as integers.

The function's behavior seems to involve checking conditions on the first input and then performing some calculations, possibly related to selecting between the second and third inputs based on certain criteria. The exact semantics might involve checking if the first number is greater than 1 and less than 4, then using some modulo operation to decide the output.

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's one function, x_or_y, which takes three integers and performs some operations based on conditions, returning an integer result.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the format, without any markdown or extra comments. Also, variable names should be mapped correctly, but in this case, they're just integers, so no complex types like vectors are involved here.

So, the final summary should be concise, listing the function, its inputs, and a brief description of its operation.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 3 inputs: i32 x, i32 y, i32 z. function[1] is performing conditional checks on x and selecting between y and z based on the conditions, and outputs an integer result.
