Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code that the user provided. I need to summarize it according to their specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

First, I see that there's a single function defined here, @_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni, which takes an i32 input. The function has several attributes like mustprogress, nofree, etc., but I can ignore those for the summary.

Looking at the function body, it starts by taking the input %0, which is an i32, and applies a bitwise AND with 1. This effectively checks the least significant bit of the number. The result is stored in %2. Then, it does an ICMP (integer comparison) to see if %2 is equal to 0, which means the number is even. This result is in %3.

Next, there's another ICMP to check if the input %0 is greater than 7. This is stored in %4. The function then uses an AND operation on %4 and %3, which means it's checking if both conditions are true: the number is even AND greater than 7. The result of this AND is returned as the output.

So, putting it all together, the function takes an integer and returns true if it's both even and greater than 7. Otherwise, it returns false.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. The input is an i32, which in C++ is an int. The output is an i1, which is a bool. So the function takes an int and returns a bool.

The function's semantic is to check if the input integer meets both conditions. Therefore, the summary should state that there's one function that takes an int and returns a bool indicating whether the number is even and greater than 7.

I also need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or additional comments. So, I'll structure it exactly as the example provided, ensuring the variable names and types are correctly transcribed.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int number. function[1] is checking if the number is even and greater than 7 on number, and outputs a boolean value indicating if both conditions are met.
