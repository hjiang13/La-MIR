Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code, and I need to summarize it according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

First, I see that there's a single function defined here, @_Z15truncate_numberf, which takes a float as input. The function name suggests it's truncating a number, probably removing the fractional part or something similar.

Looking at the code inside the function:

1. %2 = fptosi float %0 to i32: This converts the input float %0 to an integer. So, it's essentially truncating the decimal part because converting a float to an integer in this way discards the fractional part.

2. %3 = sitofp i32 %2 to float: Now, the integer %2 is converted back to a float. This would give us the float value of the integer part of the original number.

3. %4 = fsub float %0, %3: This subtracts the truncated float %3 from the original float %0. The result is the fractional part that was removed during truncation.

4. ret float %4: The function returns this fractional part.

So, putting it all together, the function takes a float, truncates it to get the integer part, subtracts that from the original to get the fractional part, and returns that fractional part.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. In this case, the function takes a float and returns a float. There are no other inputs or complex types involved, so the summary should reflect that.

The output format requires stating the number of functions, the inputs each function takes, what the function does, and what it outputs. Since there's only one function here, I'll structure it accordingly.

I also need to ensure that I don't add any extra comments or explanations, just stick to the specified format. No markdown, just plain text.

So, the summary should be: There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: float number. function[1] is truncating the number and returning its fractional part on number, and outputs a float value representing the fractional part.
