Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

First, the user provided an IR code snippet and wants a summary in a specific format. The format is quite structured: it should mention the number of functions, each function's inputs, and what the function does, ending with the output.

Looking at the example they gave, it's clear that each function is described with its inputs and a brief semantic description. For instance, the example function takes a vector of floats and a threshold, checks if any two elements are closer than the threshold, and returns a boolean.

Now, looking at the provided IR code, I see that there's a single function defined: @_Z3addii. Let me break this down.

The function is declared as `define dso_local i32 @_Z3addii(i32 %0, i32 %1) ...`. The name seems to be mangled, but based on the example, I can guess that @_Z3addii probably corresponds to a function named "add" that takes two integers. The function body is straightforward: it adds the two i32 arguments and returns the result.

So, the function takes two inputs, both i32 (which is an integer in C++). It performs an addition on these two inputs and outputs the result as an i32.

I need to map the IR types to C++ types as per the rules. Since the example maps `% "class.std::vector"*` to `vector<float> numbers`, I should check if there are any similar types here. In this case, the inputs are i32, which directly correspond to `int` in C++.

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's 1 function, which takes two integers, adds them, and returns an integer.

I also need to ensure that the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or additional comments. The example provided by the user helps clarify how to structure this.

So, the final summary should be concise, mentioning the number of functions, the inputs each function takes, what the function does, and the output type.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: i32 a, i32 b. function[1] is adding the two integers a and b, and outputs an integer.
