Okay, I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding the code.

Looking at the IR code, I see a function named @_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. The function takes a single input, which is a pointer to a vector of integers. The function is named "count_nums", and it's likely counting something in the vector.

In the IR code, the function starts by loading the start and end pointers of the vector. It calculates the size by subtracting the start pointer from the end pointer. If the size is zero, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of elements by dividing the size by 2, ensuring at least one element is processed.

Then, it loops through each element. For each element, it checks if it's greater than 0. If not, it converts the negative number to positive and sums its digits. It compares the sum of the digits with the original number to determine if it's a valid number according to some criteria.

The function increments a counter each time it finds a valid number and continues until all elements are processed. Finally, it returns the count of such numbers.

So, the function takes a vector of integers and counts how many of them meet a specific condition related to their digits. The output is the count of such numbers.

Now, I need to map the IR types to C++ types as per the rules. The input is a vector of integers, so it's vector<int> numbers. The function's name is count_nums, and it's counting numbers based on their digit properties.

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's one function, it takes a vector<int> as input, and it's counting numbers that meet a certain digit-related condition, outputting an integer count.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: vector<int> numbers. function[1] is counting numbers in the vector based on their digit properties on numbers, and outputs an integer count.
