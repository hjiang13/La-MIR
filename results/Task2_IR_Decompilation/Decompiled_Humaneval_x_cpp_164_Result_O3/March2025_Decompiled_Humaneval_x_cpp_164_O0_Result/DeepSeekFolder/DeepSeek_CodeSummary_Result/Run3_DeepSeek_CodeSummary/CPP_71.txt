Okay, I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding the code.

Looking at the IR code, there's a function named @_Z13triangle_areafff which takes three float inputs. The function seems to perform some calculations related to triangles. It first adds two sides and compares them, then checks if the sum is greater than the third side. If certain conditions are met, it calculates the area using Heron's formula, which involves squares and a square root. If the conditions aren't met, it returns -1.0.

Now, applying the user's rules: I need to map IR types to C++ types. The function takes three floats, so in C++ that's float, float, float. The function's purpose is to compute the area of a triangle if the sides form a valid triangle, otherwise return -1. 

I should structure the summary exactly as the example. There's only one function, so I'll state that. The function takes three float inputs and describes its action on them, outputting the area or -1.

I must avoid any markdown and stick strictly to the format. No extra comments or explanations. Just the facts as per the example.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 3 inputs: float a, float b, float c. function[1] is calculating the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c using Heron's formula if the sides form a valid triangle, otherwise returning -1.0, and outputs the computed area or -1.0.
