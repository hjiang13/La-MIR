Okay, I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding the code.

Looking at the IR code, there's a single function defined: @_Z10choose_numii. It takes two i32 inputs, %0 and %1. The function has some conditional checks and arithmetic operations.

First, I'll map the IR types to C++ types. The inputs are i32, which corresponds to int in C++. The function returns an i32 as well.

Next, I'll analyze what the function does. It starts with an icmp (integer compare) to check if %1 is less than %0. Depending on that, it branches to different labels. There's a check for equality and some calculations involving the remainder when %1 is divided by 2. 

The function seems to be making decisions based on whether the numbers are equal, whether one is less than the other, and their parity (even or odd). The return value is determined through these conditions, returning -1 in some cases and a computed value in others.

Putting it all together, the function takes two integers and returns another integer based on these conditional checks. So, the summary should reflect that there's one function taking two int inputs and returning an int after performing these checks.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: int a, int b. function[1] is checking if the second number is less than the first, if the numbers are equal, or if the second number is odd when equal, and returns an integer based on these conditions.
