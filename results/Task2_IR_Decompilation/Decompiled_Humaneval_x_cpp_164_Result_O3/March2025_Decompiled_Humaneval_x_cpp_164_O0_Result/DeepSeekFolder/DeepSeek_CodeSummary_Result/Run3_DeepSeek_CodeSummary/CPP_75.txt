Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this IR code according to the user's instructions. Let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided an example where they converted an IR code snippet into a specific formatted summary. My task is to do the same for the given IR code.

First, I'll look at the provided IR code. It defines a function named @_Z17is_multiply_primei which takes an i32 input and returns a boolean (i1). The function seems to be checking if a number is a multiply prime. 

Looking at the example the user gave, they converted a function that checks for close elements in a vector into a summary that describes the function's purpose in natural language. So, I need to do something similar here.

I'll start by identifying the number of functions in the code. In this case, there's only one function. Next, I need to determine the inputs. The function takes a single input of type i32, which is an integer. 

Now, I need to figure out what the function does. The function name suggests it's checking if a number is a multiply prime. Looking at the code, it seems to perform several checks and loops, likely testing divisibility and factors. The function returns true if the number meets certain conditions related to being a multiply prime.

According to the user's mapping rules, I should convert IR types to their C++ equivalents. Here, i32 corresponds to int in C++. So, the function takes an int as input and returns a boolean.

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's one function, it takes an int input, and it checks if the number is a multiply prime, returning a boolean.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or additional comments. The example provided by the user ends with a period, so I'll follow that structure.

I think I've covered all the necessary steps. Now, I'll craft the summary accordingly.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int number. function[1] is checking if the given number is a multiply prime, and outputs a boolean value indicating the result.
