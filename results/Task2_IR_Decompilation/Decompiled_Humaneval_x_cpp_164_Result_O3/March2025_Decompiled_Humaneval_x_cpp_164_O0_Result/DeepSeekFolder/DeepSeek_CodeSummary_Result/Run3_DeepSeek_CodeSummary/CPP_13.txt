Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code, and I need to summarize it according to the given specifications. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I see that the module is named after a C++ file, specifically 'CPP_13.cpp'. The target is x86-64 Linux, which is standard. The function defined here is `_Z23greatest_common_divisorii`, which I recognize as the mangled name for a function called 'greatest_common_divisor' that takes two integers and returns an integer.

Looking at the function attributes, it's marked as mustprogress, nofree, norecurse, nosync, nounwind, readnone, and willreturn. These suggest that the function is optimized for performance and doesn't have side effects, which makes sense for a GCD calculation.

The function starts with a loop labeled '3'. Inside the loop, there are phi nodes for variables %4 and %5, which are initialized with %1 and %0 respectively. These seem to be the two input integers being worked on. 

There's an ICMP instruction checking if %5 is less than %4. Depending on this condition, the select instructions choose the smaller and larger of the two values, assigning them to %7 and %8. Then, %9 is the remainder of dividing %8 by %7. If this remainder is zero, the loop exits and returns %7 as the GCD. Otherwise, the loop continues with updated values.

So, the function is implementing the Euclidean algorithm for GCD. It repeatedly replaces the larger number with the remainder of the division until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. The inputs are i32, which is int in C++. The function takes two ints and returns an int. 

Putting it all together, the function takes two integers and computes their GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, returning the result as an integer.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: i32 a, i32 b. function[1] is computing the greatest common divisor of two integers on a, b, and outputs an integer value representing the GCD.
