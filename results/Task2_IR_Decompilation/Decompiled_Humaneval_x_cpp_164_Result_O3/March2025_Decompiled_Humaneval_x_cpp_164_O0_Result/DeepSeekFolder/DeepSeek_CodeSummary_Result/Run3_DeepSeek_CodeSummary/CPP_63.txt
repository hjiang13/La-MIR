Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided an example where they converted an IR code snippet into a specific format, and now they want me to do the same for another IR code.

Looking at the example, the user wants a summary that lists the number of functions, the inputs each function takes, what the function does semantically, and what it outputs. The format is very strict, so I need to make sure I follow it exactly without adding any extra comments or formatting.

Now, looking at the IR code provided, I see that there's a function named @_Z6fibfibi which takes an i32 input. The function seems to be related to Fibonacci numbers because of the name. Let me go through the code step by step.

The function starts by allocating an array of 100 i32s. It initializes the first few elements with 0, 0, and 1. Then there's a check if the input is less than 3, in which case it returns the input directly. Otherwise, it proceeds to compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively.

I notice that there are loops and conditionals that handle different cases, possibly for even and odd indices. The function stores computed values into the array and eventually returns the value at the index corresponding to the input.

So, putting this together, the function takes an integer n and computes the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with memoization in an array. It returns the computed Fibonacci number as an integer.

Now, mapping the IR types to C++ types as per the rules, the input is an i32, which is an integer in C++. The function doesn't take any other inputs, so it's just one input.

Therefore, the summary should state that there's 1 function, which takes 1 input (an integer), computes the nth Fibonacci number, and returns it as an integer.

I need to make sure the output exactly matches the specified format without any markdown or additional explanations. So, the final summary should be concise and follow the example provided.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: i32 n. function[1] is computing the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with memoization in an array and outputs the result as an integer.
