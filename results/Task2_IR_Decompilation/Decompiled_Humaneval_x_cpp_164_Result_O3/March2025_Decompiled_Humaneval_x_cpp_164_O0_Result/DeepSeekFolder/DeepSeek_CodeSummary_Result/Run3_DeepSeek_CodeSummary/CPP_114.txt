Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this IR code according to the user's instructions. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided an example where they converted an IR code snippet into a specific format, and they want me to do the same for the given IR code.

First, I'll look at the IR code they provided. It's a function named @_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE, which takes a single input of type %"class.std::vector"*. The user's mapping rules say that %"class.std::vector"* should be summarized as vector<float> numbers, but in this case, the vector contains long long elements. So I need to adjust that accordingly.

Looking at the function, it seems to be calculating the minimum subarray sum. The function is quite complex with multiple loops and condition checks. It loads elements from the vector, performs some arithmetic operations, and keeps track of the minimum sum found.

The user's example output for a different function was: "There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<float> numbers, float threshold. function[1] is checking if any two elements in the vector are closer to each other than the given threshold on numbers, threshold, and outputs a boolean value indicating if such elements exist."

So, I need to follow that format. In this case, there's only one function, which takes one input: a vector of long long integers. The function's purpose is to find the minimum subarray sum, which is a common problem in algorithm interviews.

I should make sure to map the IR types correctly. The input is a vector of long long, so I'll write it as vector<long long> numbers. The function's output is an i64, which is a 64-bit integer, representing the minimum sum.

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's one function that takes a vector<long long> and returns the minimum subarray sum as an i64.

I also need to ensure that I don't add any extra comments or explanations, just stick to the specified format. No markdown, just plain text.

So, the final summary should be: "There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: vector<long long> numbers. function[1] is finding the minimum subarray sum on numbers and outputs the minimum sum as an i64."

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: vector<long long> numbers. function[1] is finding the minimum subarray sum on numbers and outputs the minimum sum as an i64.
