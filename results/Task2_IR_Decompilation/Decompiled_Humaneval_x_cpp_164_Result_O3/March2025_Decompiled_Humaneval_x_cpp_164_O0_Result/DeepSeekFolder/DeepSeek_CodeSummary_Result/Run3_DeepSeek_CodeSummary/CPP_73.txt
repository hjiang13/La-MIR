Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code, and I need to summarize it according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

First, I see that the module is related to a C++ file, specifically mentioning vector operations. The target is x86-64 Linux, which is standard. The function defined here is `_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which I think translates to a function called `smallest_change` taking a `vector<int>` as an argument.

Looking at the function attributes, it's marked as mustprogress, nofree, norecurse, nosync, nounwind, readonly, uwtable, and willreturn. These suggest it's a function that doesn't modify the input, doesn't have side effects, and is optimized for performance.

Now, diving into the function body. The function starts by getting pointers to the vector's elements. It loads the end pointer and the start pointer, then calculates the size of the vector by subtracting the start from the end. It then right-shifts this size by 2, which effectively divides it by 4, and subtracts 1. This gives the maximum index to check.

The function then checks if this maximum index is 0. If it is, it returns 0 immediately. Otherwise, it enters a loop where it iterates through the vector, comparing each element with the next one. It counts how many times two consecutive elements are different. This count is then returned as the result.

So, putting this together, the function takes a vector of integers and counts the number of times consecutive elements change. The output is this count.

Now, applying the user's mapping rules. The input type `% "class.std::vector"*` should be summarized as `vector<float> numbers`, but in this case, it's a vector of integers. So I'll adjust accordingly to `vector<int> numbers`.

The function takes one input, the vector, and outputs an integer representing the count of changes. Therefore, the summary should reflect that.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or additional comments. So, the final summary will state there's one function that takes a vector of integers and returns the count of consecutive changes.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: vector<int> numbers. function[1] is counting the number of times consecutive elements change in the vector on numbers and outputs an integer value representing the count of changes.
