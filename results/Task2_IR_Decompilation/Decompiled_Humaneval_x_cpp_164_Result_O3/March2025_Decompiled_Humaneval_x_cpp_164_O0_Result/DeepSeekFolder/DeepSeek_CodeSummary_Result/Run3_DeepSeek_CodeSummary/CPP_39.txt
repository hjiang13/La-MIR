Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code, and I need to summarize it according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

First, I see that there's a module with some target settings, but the main focus is on the function @_Z9prime_fibi, which takes an i32 input. The function has a few labels and uses phi nodes, which suggests it's handling loops and conditional branches.

Looking at the code, it starts with a br label %2, which means it's jumping to label 2. Label 2 has phi nodes for %3, %4, and %5, which are initialized with values 1, 2, and 0 respectively. Then there's an icmp to check if %5 is less than %0, which is the input. If true, it proceeds; otherwise, it's undefined because of the assume.

Next, %7 is the sum of %4 and %3, which looks like it's generating Fibonacci numbers. Then, it checks if %4 is less than 4. If so, it branches to label %19; otherwise, it goes to label %9.

Label %9 is a loop where it increments %10, checks if %4 modulo %10 is zero, and then decides whether to continue looping or not. If it finds a divisor, it sets %18 to false, otherwise continues. This part seems to be checking for primality.

Label %19 is where it updates %22 based on whether a prime was found, increments %5, and checks if it's reached the input value. If so, it returns %4, which is the last Fibonacci prime found.

Putting it all together, the function is generating Fibonacci numbers and checking each for primality until it reaches the input count. It returns the last prime found.

Now, mapping the IR types to C++ as per the rules, the function takes an i32 and returns an i32. So, the summary should reflect that it's checking Fibonacci primes up to a given count and returns the last one.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or extra comments. The function takes one input, an integer, and outputs an integer. The semantic is checking Fibonacci primes and returning the last one based on the input count.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: i32 n. function[1] is checking Fibonacci primes up to the given count on n, and outputs an i32 value indicating the last Fibonacci prime found.
