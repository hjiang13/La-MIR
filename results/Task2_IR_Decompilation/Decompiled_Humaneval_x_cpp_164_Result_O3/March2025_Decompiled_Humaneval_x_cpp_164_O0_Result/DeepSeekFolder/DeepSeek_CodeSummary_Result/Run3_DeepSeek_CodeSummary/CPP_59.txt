Alright, I need to summarize the provided IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding the code.

Looking at the IR code, I see a single function named @_Z20largest_prime_factori. It takes an i32 input, which is an integer. The function seems to be calculating the largest prime factor of that integer.

I'll break down the function's operations. It starts by checking if the input is less than 4, which likely handles small cases directly. Then, it enters a loop where it tries to divide the number by increasing integers starting from 2. If the division is exact, it continues factoring the quotient. This process repeats until the remaining number is a prime itself, which becomes the largest prime factor.

Now, mapping the IR types to C++ types, the input i32 corresponds to an int in C++. The function doesn't have any other inputs, so it's a single parameter.

Putting it all together, the function takes an integer and returns its largest prime factor. I'll structure the summary exactly as the user specified, ensuring no markdown and strict adherence to the format.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int n. function[1] is finding the largest prime factor of the given integer n and outputs the largest prime factor.
