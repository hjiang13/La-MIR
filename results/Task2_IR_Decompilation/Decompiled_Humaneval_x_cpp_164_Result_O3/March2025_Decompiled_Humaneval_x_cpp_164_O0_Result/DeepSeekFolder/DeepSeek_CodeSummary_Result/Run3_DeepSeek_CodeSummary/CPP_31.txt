Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

First, the user provided an IR code snippet and wants a summary in a specific format. The format is quite strict, so I need to pay close attention to that. The example they gave shows that they want a description of each function, including the number of inputs, their types, and what the function does, followed by an output.

Looking at the IR code, I see that there's a single function defined: @_Z8is_primex(i64 %0). The function takes one input, which is an i64 (a 64-bit integer). The function name suggests it's checking if a number is prime.

Now, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. In this case, i64 corresponds to 'long long' in C++. So the input is of type long long.

Next, I need to describe what the function does. From the code, it looks like it's implementing a primality test. It first checks if the number is less than 2, which immediately returns false. Then it checks divisibility starting from 2 upwards. It uses a loop to test divisors up to the square root of the number. If any divisor divides the number evenly, it's not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

Putting this together, the function takes a long long input and checks if it's a prime number, returning a boolean.

I also need to ensure that the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or additional comments. The example provided by the user helps clarify how to structure this.

So, the summary should state that there's 1 function, which takes 1 input of type long long, and that the function checks if the input is a prime number, returning a boolean.

I think that's all. I just need to make sure I adhere to the format exactly as the user instructed, without adding anything extra.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: long long x. function[1] is checking if x is a prime number on x and outputs a boolean value indicating if x is prime.
