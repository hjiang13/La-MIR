Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding the code provided.

Looking at the IR code, I see that there's a module with a single function defined. The function is named @_Z18car_race_collisioni and it takes an i32 parameter %0. The function's body is quite simple: it multiplies %0 by itself and returns the result.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their equivalent C++ types. In this case, the function takes an i32, which in C++ is an integer, typically int. The function returns an i32 as well, so that's also an int.

The function's semantic is straightforwardâ€”it's squaring the input. So, the function takes an integer, squares it, and returns the result.

The user provided an example where they had a function that took a vector and a float, and the summary described the function's purpose. In this case, the function is much simpler, just a square operation.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format. The example had "There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: ...". Since this function only takes one input, I'll adjust accordingly.

So, the summary should state that there's 1 function, it takes 1 input (an integer), and it's squaring that input, then returning the result.

I also need to ensure that I don't add any extra comments or explanations, just the facts in the specified format. No markdown, just plain text.

Putting it all together, the summary should be concise and match the format exactly.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int x. function[1] is squaring the input x and outputs the result.
