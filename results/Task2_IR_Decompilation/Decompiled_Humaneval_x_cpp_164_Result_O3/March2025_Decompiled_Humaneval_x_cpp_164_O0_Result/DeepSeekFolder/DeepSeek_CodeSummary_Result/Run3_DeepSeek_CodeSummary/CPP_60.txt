Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

Looking at the IR code, there's a function named @_Z8sum_to_ni which takes an i32 parameter. The function computes the sum of the first n integers. It adds 1 to the input, multiplies by the input, then divides by 2. So, it's essentially calculating n*(n+1)/2.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. In this case, the function takes an i32, which in C++ is an int. The output is also an i32, so the return type is int.

The function doesn't have any complex structures like vectors or pointers, so the mapping is straightforward. The function's name in C++ would likely be sum_to_n, taking an int and returning an int.

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's 1 function, it takes 1 input (int n), and it computes the sum up to n, returning an int.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or extra comments. So, the final summary will be concise and match the example provided.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int n. function[1] is computing the sum of the first n integers on n, and outputs an integer value.
