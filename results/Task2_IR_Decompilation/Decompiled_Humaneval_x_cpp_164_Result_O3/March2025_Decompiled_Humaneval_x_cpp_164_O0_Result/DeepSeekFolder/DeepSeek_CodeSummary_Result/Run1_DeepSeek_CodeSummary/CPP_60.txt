Alright, so I'm looking at this IR code that the user provided. My task is to summarize it according to specific guidelines. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the code is doing. The IR code defines a function named @_Z8sum_to_ni, which takes an i32 parameter. The function computes the sum of the first n integers. It does this by adding 1 to the input, multiplying by the input, and then dividing by 2. That makes sense because the sum from 1 to n is n*(n+1)/2.

Next, I have to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. In this case, the function takes an i32, which is a 32-bit integer. In C++, that's just an int. The function returns an i32 as well, so the return type is also int.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to summarize the code in a specific format. They provided an example where they described the function's inputs, what it does, and the output. I should follow that structure.

I see that there's only one function in the code, so the summary will mention that. The function takes one input, which is an integer, and it computes the sum up to that integer. The output is the result of this computation.

I also need to ensure that I don't add any extra comments or explanations, just stick to the format. No markdown, so I'll avoid any special formatting characters.

Putting it all together, the summary should clearly state the number of functions, the inputs each function takes, what each function does, and what it outputs. In this case, it's straightforward since there's only one function.

I should double-check that I'm using the correct variable names and types as per the mapping rules. Since there are no complex types like vectors in this code, it's simpler. The function is just dealing with integers.

Finally, I'll make sure the summary is concise and exactly matches the required format without any deviations. That way, the user gets the precise information they need without any unnecessary details.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: i32 n. function[1] is calculating the sum of the first n integers on n, and outputs an integer value representing the result.
