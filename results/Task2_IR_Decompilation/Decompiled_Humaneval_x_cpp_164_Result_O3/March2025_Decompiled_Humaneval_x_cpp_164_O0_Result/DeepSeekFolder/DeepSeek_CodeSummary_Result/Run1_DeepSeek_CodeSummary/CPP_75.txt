Okay, I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding the code provided.

Looking at the IR code, I see that there's a single function defined: @_Z17is_multiply_primei. It takes an i32 input, which is an integer. The function name suggests it's checking if a number is a multiply prime. 

I'll go through the function step by step. It starts by comparing the input with 4. If it's less than 4, it branches to label 11, which checks if the number is 2 and returns true. Otherwise, it proceeds to label 3.

In label 3, it initializes some variables and starts a loop. It calculates the remainder of the number divided by a divisor. If the remainder is zero and the divisor is smaller than the number, it continues checking. It keeps incrementing the divisor and checking divisibility.

The loop continues until the square of the divisor exceeds the number. If no divisors are found, it returns false. So, the function is checking if the input number is a prime that can be expressed as a product of two primes.

Now, mapping the IR types to C++. The input is i32, which is an integer in C++. The function returns an i1, which is a boolean. So, the function takes an integer and returns a boolean indicating if it's a multiply prime.

Putting it all together, the function is named is_multiply_prime, takes an integer, and returns a boolean. The summary should reflect that it checks if the number is a multiply prime.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: i32 n. function[1] is checking if the input number is a multiply prime, and outputs a boolean value indicating if the number is a multiply prime.
