Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm looking at the provided IR code and need to summarize it according to the given specifications. 

First, I'll examine the IR code to identify the functions present. I see that there's a function named @_Z8multiplyii. It takes two i32 inputs, which are 32-bit integers. 

Next, I'll analyze what this function does. The function starts by taking the absolute value of each input using llvm.abs.i32. Then, it computes the remainder when each absolute value is divided by 10. This effectively gives the last digit of each input number. 

After obtaining the last digits, the function multiplies them together using mul nuw nsw, which indicates that the multiplication doesn't wrap around and uses normal semantics. Finally, it returns this product as an i32 value.

Now, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. The inputs are i32, which correspond to int in C++. The function's name @_Z8multiplyii suggests it's a C++ function named multiply that takes two integers and returns an integer.

Putting it all together, the function takes two integers, processes their last digits, multiplies them, and returns the result. So, the summary should reflect that there's one function which takes two int inputs and outputs their product based on the last digits.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: int a, int b. function[1] is computing the product of the last digits of a and b on a, b, and outputs an integer value.
