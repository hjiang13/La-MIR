Okay, I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding the code.

Looking at the IR code, I see a module with some type definitions and a function. The function is named @_Z15closest_integerNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE. That's a mangled C++ name, so I'll need to demangle it to understand what it does.

Demangling the function name, @_Z15closest_integerNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE, I get something like "closest_integer(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char>>)". So the function takes a std::string as input.

Now, looking at the function's body. It starts by getting the element pointer of the string, which in IR terms is accessing the data. Then it loads the pointer to the string's data into %3. Next, it calls strtod to convert the string to a double. After that, it rounds the double using llvm.round.f64 and converts it to an integer with fptosi. Finally, it returns that integer.

So the function is taking a string, converting it to a double, rounding it, and returning the closest integer.

Now, applying the user's mapping rules. The input type is %"class.std::__cxx11::basic_string", which should be mapped to std::string. The function takes one input, so m is 1. The output is an i32, which is an integer.

Putting it all together, the function takes a std::string as input, processes it to find the closest integer, and returns that integer.

I need to format this exactly as specified. The output should state that there's 1 function, which takes 1 input of type std::string, and outputs an integer. The function's semantic is converting the string to the closest integer.

I should make sure not to include any markdown or extra comments, just the plain text as per the example.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: std::string input. function[1] is converting the input string to the closest integer value and outputs an integer.
