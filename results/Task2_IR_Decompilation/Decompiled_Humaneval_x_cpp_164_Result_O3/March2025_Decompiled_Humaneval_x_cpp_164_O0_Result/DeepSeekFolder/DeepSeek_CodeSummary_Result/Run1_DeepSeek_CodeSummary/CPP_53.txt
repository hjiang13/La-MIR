Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding the IR code provided.

Looking at the code, I see that there's a module with some target specifications and a function defined. The function is named @_Z3addii, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using my knowledge, I recall that in C++, when functions are compiled, their names are mangled to include type information. So, @_Z3addii likely corresponds to a function named "add" that takes two integers and returns an integer.

Let me break down the function:

- The function is defined as `define dso_local i32 @_Z3addii(i32 %0, i32 %1) ...`
- It takes two i32 parameters, %0 and %1.
- Inside the function, it adds the two parameters using `add nsw i32 %1, %0` and stores the result in %3.
- Then it returns %3.

So, the function is simply adding the two input integers and returning the result.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. In this case, i32 corresponds to int in C++. The function takes two ints and returns an int.

The output format requires me to state the number of functions, the inputs each function takes, what the function does, and what it outputs. Since there's only one function here, I'll structure it accordingly.

I should also ensure that I follow the type and variable name mapping rules. Here, there are no complex types like vectors, so it's straightforwardâ€”i32 maps to int.

Putting it all together, the summary should be concise and follow the exact format specified, without any additional comments or markdown.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: int a, int b. function[1] is adding the two integers a and b, and outputs the result.
