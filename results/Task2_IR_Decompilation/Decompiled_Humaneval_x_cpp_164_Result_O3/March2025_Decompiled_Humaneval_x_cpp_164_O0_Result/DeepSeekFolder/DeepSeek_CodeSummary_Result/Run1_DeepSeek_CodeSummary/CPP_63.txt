Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the IR code, I see a function named @_Z6fibfibi which takes an i32 parameter. The function starts by allocating an array of 100 i32 elements. It initializes the first few elements with 0 and 1, which suggests it's setting up a Fibonacci sequence.

The code then has a conditional check to see if the input is less than 3. If so, it branches to label 31, which loads the corresponding value from the array and returns it. Otherwise, it proceeds to set up more initial values and enters a loop.

In the loop, there are some complex calculations involving phi nodes, which indicates multiple paths of execution. It seems to be calculating Fibonacci numbers using a dynamic programming approach, storing each result in the array. The loop continues until it reaches the desired index based on the input parameter.

Once the loop completes, the function loads the result from the array and returns it. There are also calls to llvm.lifetime.start and end, which manage the memory lifetime of the allocated array.

Now, mapping the IR types to C++ types, the function takes an i32 (which is an integer) as input and returns an i32. The array is of type [100 x i32], so in C++ terms, it's an array of integers.

Putting it all together, the function is implementing a Fibonacci calculation using an array to store intermediate results. It initializes the base cases and iteratively fills the array up to the nth value based on the input. The function then returns the nth Fibonacci number.

So, the summary should state that there's one function, which takes an integer input and returns an integer output, specifically the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with an array.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: i32 n. function[1] is computing the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with an array of 100 integers to store intermediate results on n, and outputs the nth Fibonacci number.
