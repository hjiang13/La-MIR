Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the IR code, I see a function named @_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE, which seems to be a mangled C++ name. Using my knowledge, I can demangle this to something like "smallest_change(std::vector<int>)". So the function takes a vector of integers as input.

Now, I need to figure out what this function does. Let's go through the IR step by step.

First, the function loads some pointers from the vector. It gets the element at position 0,0,0,1 which is likely the end iterator, and position 0,0,0,0 which is the begin iterator. It then converts these pointers to integers and subtracts them to get the size, right? Because the difference between end and begin gives the number of elements.

Wait, but the subtraction is followed by an arithmetic shift right by 2. Oh, that's because the size is being divided by 4, since each element is an integer (4 bytes). So, the size is stored in %8, and then %9 is size/4 - 1. Hmm, but then there's a check if %10 is zero. If it is, the function returns 0.

If not, it enters a loop where it iterates through the vector, comparing each pair of adjacent elements. It increments a counter whenever two consecutive elements are different. Finally, it returns this counter.

So, putting it all together, the function counts the number of times consecutive elements in the vector are different. That's the semantic function here.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to C++ types. The input is a vector of integers, so that's vector<int> numbers. The function doesn't take any other inputs, so it's just one input.

The output is an integer, which is the count of changes between consecutive elements.

I should structure the summary exactly as the example provided. There's only one function, it takes one input, and it's doing this counting, outputting an integer.

I need to make sure I follow the format strictly, without any markdown or extra comments. Just a plain text summary as specified.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: vector<int> numbers. function[1] is counting the number of times consecutive elements in the vector change values on numbers and outputs an integer value representing the count of changes.
