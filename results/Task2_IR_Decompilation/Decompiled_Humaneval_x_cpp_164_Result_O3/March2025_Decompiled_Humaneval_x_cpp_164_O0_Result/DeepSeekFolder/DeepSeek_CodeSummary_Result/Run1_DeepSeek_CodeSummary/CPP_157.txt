Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code, and I need to summarize it according to the given specifications. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I see that the module is related to a C++ file, specifically mentioning right_angle_triangle. The function defined is @_Z20right_angle_trianglefff, which suggests it's a function that takes three floats and returns a boolean. The name "right_angle_triangle" implies it's checking if three sides form a right-angled triangle.

Looking at the function, it starts by squaring each of the three inputs (a, b, c) using fmul. Then it adds a squared and b squared, subtracts c squared, and checks if the absolute value is close to zero. If that's true, it returns true. If not, it checks the other two combinations: a squared plus c squared minus b squared, and b squared plus c squared minus a squared. Each time, it's checking if any of these conditions are close enough to zero, which would indicate a right angle.

The function uses fabs to get the absolute value and then compares it to a small epsilon (1e-4). If any of the three conditions meet this, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

So, putting it all together, the function takes three floats as inputs and checks if they can form a right-angled triangle by verifying the Pythagorean theorem in all three possible combinations. It outputs a boolean based on whether any of these checks pass.

I need to make sure the summary follows the specified format exactly, listing the number of functions, their inputs, and what they do, without any extra comments or formatting. The variable names should be mapped correctly, but in this case, they're just floats, so no complex types to handle.

I think that's all. The function is straightforward, checking each combination of sides to see if they satisfy the right angle condition.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 3 inputs: float a, float b, float c. function[1] is checking if the given sides form a right-angled triangle by verifying the Pythagorean theorem for all three combinations of sides on a, b, c, and outputs a boolean value indicating if any combination satisfies the condition.
