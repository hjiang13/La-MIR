Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

Looking at the IR code, I see a function named @_Z9is_sortedSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. From the example provided, I know that @_Z18has_close_elementsSt6vectorIfSaIfEEf was summarized as checking if any two elements in a vector are closer than a threshold. So, I need to figure out what this function does.

The function takes a vector of integers (%"class.std::vector"*). The IR code seems to be checking elements in the vector. It loads the data and size pointers, calculates the size, and then loops through the elements.

In the loop, it compares each element with the next one. If any element is less than the next, it returns false. If it goes through all elements without finding any out of order, it returns true.

So, this function is checking if the vector is sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the vector is sorted.

Now, applying the user's mapping rules, %"class.std::vector"* should be summarized as vector<int> numbers. The function takes one input, the vector, and outputs a boolean.

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's one function that takes a vector<int> and checks if it's sorted, returning a boolean.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: vector<int> numbers. function[1] is checking if the vector is sorted in non-decreasing order on numbers, and outputs a boolean value indicating if the vector is sorted.
