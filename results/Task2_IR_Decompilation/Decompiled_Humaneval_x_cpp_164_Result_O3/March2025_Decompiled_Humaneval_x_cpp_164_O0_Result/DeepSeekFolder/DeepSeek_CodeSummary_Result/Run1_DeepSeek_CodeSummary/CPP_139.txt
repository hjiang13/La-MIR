Alright, let's tackle this problem. The user has provided an IR code snippet and wants a summary following specific formatting rules. 

First, I need to understand the IR code. It's a function named @_Z17special_factoriali which takes an i32 input and returns an i64. Looking at the code, it seems to handle different cases based on the input value. 

The function starts by checking if the input is less than 1. If so, it returns 1. Otherwise, it proceeds with some calculations. There are loops and conditional branches that suggest it's performing some kind of iterative computation, possibly a factorial.

Next, I need to map the IR types to C++ types as per the rules. The function takes an i32 parameter, which maps to int in C++. The return type is i64, which is long long in C++. 

The function's logic seems to compute the factorial of the input. It initializes some variables and uses loops to multiply iteratively, adjusting the input value as it goes. There's also handling for specific cases, like when the input is 0 or 1, which aligns with factorial behavior.

Now, I need to summarize this into the specified format. The function takes one input, an int, and returns a long long. The semantic function is computing the factorial of that input.

I must ensure the output strictly follows the format without any markdown or extra comments. So, the summary will state there's 1 function, describe its inputs, and its purpose.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int n. function[1] is computing the special factorial of n on n and outputs a long long value representing the result.
