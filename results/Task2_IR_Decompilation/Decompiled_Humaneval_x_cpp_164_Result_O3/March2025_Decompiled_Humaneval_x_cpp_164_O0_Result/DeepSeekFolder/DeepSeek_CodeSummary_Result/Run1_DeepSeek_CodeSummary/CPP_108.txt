Okay, so I need to summarize the given IR code according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the IR code, I see a function named @_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. From the naming convention, it seems like it's a C++ function that's been compiled. The prefix suggests it's a function called count_nums taking a vector of integers.

The function takes a single input: a pointer to a vector of integers. The IR code shows that it's accessing the vector's elements, iterating through them, and performing some operations. It looks like it's counting something related to the numbers in the vector.

In the code, there's a loop that processes each element. It checks if a number is greater than 0, and if so, it adds 1 to the count. If the number is negative, it takes the absolute value and then checks if it's less than -9. It breaks down the number digit by digit, summing the digits. Then it compares the sum of the digits with the original number's absolute value to decide whether to count it.

So, putting it all together, the function counts how many numbers in the vector meet a specific condition related to their digits. The condition seems to be that the sum of the digits is greater than the absolute value of the number itself.

Now, following the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to C++ types. The input is a vector of integers, so that's straightforward. The function's name in the summary should reflect what it's doing, which is counting numbers based on their digit sum.

I should structure the summary exactly as the example provided. There's only one function, so I'll state that. The function takes one input: the vector of integers. Then, I'll describe what the function does in a concise manner, mentioning the condition it checks and that it returns a count of such numbers.

I need to make sure the summary is in the specified format without any markdown or extra comments. The variable names and types should be correctly transcribed as per the mapping rules.

So, the final summary should clearly state the function's purpose, its input, and its output based on the analysis of the IR code.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: vector<int> numbers. function[1] is counting numbers in the vector based on specific digit sum conditions on numbers and outputs the count of such numbers.
