Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code, and I need to summarize it according to the given specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

First, I see that there's a function called @_Z13triangle_areafff, which takes three float inputs. The function name suggests it's related to calculating the area of a triangle. 

Looking at the code, the function starts by adding the first two floats (%0 and %1) and storing the result in %4. Then it compares this sum with the third float (%2) using an unsigned greater-than comparison, storing the result in %5. It does similar additions and comparisons for the other pairs of floats, resulting in %6, %7, %8, %9, and %10.

The function then uses a select instruction based on the logical AND of %5 and %7 to decide whether to proceed with calculating the area or not. If the condition is true, it proceeds to calculate the area; otherwise, it returns -1.0.

In the calculation part, it computes the semi-perimeter and then uses Heron's formula, which involves multiplying the differences between the semi-perimeter and each side, taking the square root, and then cubing that result. The final result is returned as a float.

So, putting this together, the function takes three floats as inputs, checks if they can form a valid triangle, and if so, calculates the area using Heron's formula. If not, it returns -1.0.

Now, according to the output format, I need to state the number of functions, the inputs each function takes, what the function does semantically, and what it outputs. I also need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents, but in this case, the inputs are just floats, so no complex types are involved.

I should make sure the summary is concise and strictly follows the specified format without any additional explanations or markdown.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 3 inputs: float a, float b, float c. function[1] is calculating the area of a triangle using Heron's formula on a, b, c, and outputs a float value representing the area, or -1.0 if the inputs cannot form a valid triangle.
