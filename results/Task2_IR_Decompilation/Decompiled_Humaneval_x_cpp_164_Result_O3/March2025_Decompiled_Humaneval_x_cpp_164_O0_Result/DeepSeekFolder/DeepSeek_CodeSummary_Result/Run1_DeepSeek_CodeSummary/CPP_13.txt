Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code, and I need to summarize it according to the user's specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

First, I see that there's a module with some target settings, but the main part is the function definition. The function is named @_Z23greatest_common_divisorii, which I think is the mangled name for something like greatest_common_divisor taking two integers. 

Looking at the function, it has two parameters, %0 and %1, both i32. The function is marked with several attributes like mustprogress, nofree, etc., which probably indicate optimization settings or constraints.

The function starts with a branch to label 3. Inside the loop, there are phi nodes for %4 and %5, which suggests that these variables are being updated each iteration. %4 is assigned either %1 or %7, and %5 is assigned either %0 or %9. 

Then there's an icmp instruction checking if %5 is less than %4. Based on this condition, %7 and %8 are selected. %7 is the smaller of %5 and %4, and %8 is the larger. Then, %9 is the remainder of %8 divided by %7. 

If %9 is zero, the loop exits and returns %7. Otherwise, it continues the loop. This looks like the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to C++ types. The function takes two i32 inputs, which in C++ are int. The function computes their GCD and returns an int.

So, the summary should state that there's one function, function[1], which takes two inputs: int a, int b. It computes the greatest common divisor of a and b and returns an int.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or extra comments. The variable names should be generic, like a and b, since the original IR uses %0 and %1, which don't have specific names.

Putting it all together, the summary should clearly state the function's purpose, inputs, and output in the required structure.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 2 inputs: int a, int b. function[1] is computing the greatest common divisor of a and b and outputs an integer value representing the GCD.
