Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code that the user provided. I need to summarize it according to their specifications. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

First, I see that there's a single function defined here, @_Z15truncate_numberf. The function takes a float as input, which is represented by %0. The function's name suggests it's truncating a number, probably removing the fractional part.

Looking at the code inside the function:

1. %2 = fptosi float %0 to i32: This converts the float %0 to an integer. So, it's essentially truncating the decimal part because converting a float to an integer in this way discards the fractional part.

2. %3 = sitofp i32 %2 to float: Now, the integer %2 is converted back to a float. This would give us the float value of the truncated integer.

3. %4 = fsub float %0, %3: This subtracts the truncated float %3 from the original float %0. The result is the fractional part that was removed during truncation.

4. ret float %4: The function returns this fractional part.

So, putting it all together, the function takes a float, truncates it to an integer, subtracts that from the original to get the fractional part, and returns that.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. In this case, the function takes a float and returns a float. There are no vectors or other complex types involved here, so the mapping is straightforward.

The output format requires me to state the number of functions, the inputs each function takes, what the function does, and what it outputs. Since there's only one function, I'll structure it accordingly.

I also need to ensure that I don't add any extra comments or explanations, just stick to the specified format. No markdown, just plain text.

So, the summary should be: There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: float x. function[1] is truncating the input float to an integer and returning the fractional part, and outputs a float value representing the fractional part.
