Okay, so I'm looking at this IR code that the user provided. My task is to summarize it according to specific rules they've given. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the IR code is doing. The code defines a function named @_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni, which takes an i32 (a 32-bit integer) as input and returns a boolean (i1). 

Looking at the function's body, it performs a few operations. The first line is %2 = and i32 %0, 1. This is taking the input integer and doing a bitwise AND with 1. That effectively checks if the least significant bit is 1, which tells us if the number is odd or even. If the result is 0, it means the number is even.

Next, %3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0. This is comparing the result of the AND operation to zero. So, %3 will be true if the number is even.

Then, %4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7. This checks if the input number is greater than 7. The 'sgt' stands for signed greater than.

Finally, %5 = and i1 %4, %3. This takes the two boolean results from the previous comparisons and performs a logical AND. So, the function returns true only if the number is even AND greater than 7.

Now, according to the user's instructions, I need to map the IR types to their C++ equivalents. In this case, the input is i32, which maps to int in C++. The function returns i1, which is a boolean.

The function's name in C++ would be something like is_equal_to_sum_even, taking an int as an argument and returning a bool. The function is checking if the input is both even and greater than 7.

Putting it all together, the summary should state that there's one function, which takes an int as input, checks if it's even and greater than 7, and returns a boolean indicating whether both conditions are met.

I need to make sure the output strictly follows the specified format without any markdown or extra comments. So, the final summary should be concise and exactly match the required structure.

There is 1 function in the code, function[1] takes 1 input: int number. function[1] is checking if the number is even and greater than 7 on number, and outputs a boolean value indicating if both conditions are met.
