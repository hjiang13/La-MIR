I am sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is in a format that is specific to a particular tool or platform, and I am not able to read or interpret that format.

However, I can suggest some general tips that may be helpful in decompiling IR code:

1. Understand the IR format: Before decompiling IR code, it is essential to understand the format in which the code is written. Different tools and platforms use different IR formats, and each format has its unique syntax and semantics.
2. Use a decompiler: There are several decompilers available that can help you decompile IR code. Some popular decompilers include IDA Pro, OllyDbg, and x86dbg. These decompilers can help you convert IR code into assembly code or C/C++ code.
3. Use a disassembler: If you are unable to find a decompiler for the specific IR format, you can try using a disassembler. A disassembler can help you convert IR code into assembly code, which can then be manually converted into C/C++ code.
4. Use a debugger: If you have access to the original source code, you can use a debugger to step through the code and understand how it works. This can help you identify the logic and algorithms used in the code and write equivalent C/C++ code.
5. Consult documentation: If you are unable to decompile the IR code, you can consult the documentation for the tool or platform that generated the code. The documentation may provide information about the IR format and how it works, which can help you understand the code and write equivalent C/C++ code.

I hope these tips are helpful in decompiling the provided IR code. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, please let me know.
