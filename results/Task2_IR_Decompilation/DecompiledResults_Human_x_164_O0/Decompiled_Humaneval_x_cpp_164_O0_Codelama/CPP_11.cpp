I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code you provided is in a format that is not supported by my decompilation capabilities.

However, I can tell you that the IR code you provided is likely in a format that is specific to a particular compiler or toolchain, and it may not be possible to decompile it to C or C++ source code without access to the original source code or the toolchain that generated the IR code.

If you have access to the original source code or the toolchain that generated the IR code, you may be able to use a decompiler or a disassembler to convert the IR code back into source code. However, this process can be complex and may not always produce accurate results.

It's also worth noting that decompilation is a complex process that can be difficult to automate, and it may not always produce the same results as the original source code. Additionally, decompilation may not be legal or ethical in all cases, so it's important to consider the potential legal and ethical implications before attempting to decompile code.
