I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code provided is not in a format that I can recognize or process.

However, I can tell you that the IR code is likely in a binary format, which is not human-readable. To decompile it, you would need to use a tool that can convert the binary code back into assembly code or source code.

If you have access to the original source code, it would be much easier to understand and work with. If you do not have access to the original source code, you may be able to use a decompilation tool to convert the binary code back into source code. However, the resulting code may not be identical to the original source code, and it may not be easy to understand or modify.
