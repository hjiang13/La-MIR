The provided IR code is a function named `_Z9prime_fibi` that takes an integer argument and returns an integer value. The function appears to be a prime number sieve, with the argument representing the number of primes to find and the return value representing the largest prime found.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int prime_fib(int n) {
  int prime[n];
  int i, j;
  int count = 0;

  for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    for (j = 2; j <= i / j; j++) {
      if (i % j == 0) {
        break;
      }
    }
    if (j > i / j) {
      prime[count] = i;
      count++;
    }
  }

  return prime[count - 1];
}
```
Note that the decompiled code may not be exactly the same as the original source code, as the IR code may have been optimized or transformed in various ways during the compilation process. However, the decompiled code should be functionally equivalent to the original source code.
