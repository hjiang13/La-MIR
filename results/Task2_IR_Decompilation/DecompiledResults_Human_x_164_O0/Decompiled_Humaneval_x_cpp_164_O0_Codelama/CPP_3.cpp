I am not able to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code you provided appears to be in a binary format, which I am not able to read or interpret.

To decompile the IR code, I would need access to the original source code or a human-readable version of the IR code. Alternatively, you can use a tool such as the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) viewer to view the IR code in a human-readable format.

Please provide me with the original source code or a human-readable version of the IR code, and I will be happy to help you decompile it.
