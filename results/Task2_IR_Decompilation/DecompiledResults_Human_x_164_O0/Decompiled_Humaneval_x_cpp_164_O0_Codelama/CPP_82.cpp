The provided IR code is a function that takes a single argument of type `class.std::__cxx11::basic_string` and returns a value of type `i1`. The function appears to be a decompilation of a C++ function that checks whether a given string of brackets is correctly balanced.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:
```
#include <string>

bool prime_length(std::string str) {
    int len = str.length();
    if (len < 2) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= len / 2; i++) {
        if (len % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
The decompiled code is a function that takes a single argument of type `std::string` and returns a value of type `bool`. The function appears to be a decompilation of a C++ function that checks whether a given string is a prime number.

It's worth noting that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ code. The decompiled code uses a different algorithm to check whether a string is a prime number, and it also has a different return type. However, the overall functionality of the decompiled code is similar to the original C++ code.
