The provided IR code is a LLVM IR representation of a C++ function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets in the string are correctly matched. The function uses a simple algorithm that iterates over the characters in the string and keeps track of the current nesting level of brackets. If the nesting level becomes negative at any point, it means that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, and the function returns false. If the nesting level is zero at the end of the iteration, it means that all brackets are correctly matched, and the function returns true.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <string>

bool correct_bracketing(std::string brackets) {
  int level = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < brackets.length(); i++) {
    if (brackets[i] == '(') {
      level++;
    } else if (brackets[i] == ')') {
      level--;
    }
    if (level < 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return level == 0;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ source code, but it is functionally equivalent. The decompiled code uses a more explicit and verbose syntax than the original code, but it is still easy to read and understand.
