The provided IR code is a LLVM IR representation of a C++ function that takes three float arguments and returns a float value. The function is defined in the "CPP_71.cpp" file.

The function appears to be a triangle area calculator that takes the lengths of the three sides of a triangle as input and returns the area of the triangle. The function first checks if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side, and if so, it returns -1.0. Otherwise, it calculates the area of the triangle using the formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) / 2, where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle (s = (a + b + c) / 2) and a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```cpp
float triangle_area(float a, float b, float c) {
    if (a + b > c && a + c > b && b + c > a) {
        float s = (a + b + c) / 2;
        return sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) / 2;
    } else {
        return -1.0;
    }
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not the original source code, but it should produce the same output as the original function for the same input values.
