I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code appears to be in a binary format, and I require a text-based format to decompile it.

If you could provide me with the IR code in a text-based format, such as LLVM IR or MSIL, I would be happy to try and decompile it for you.
