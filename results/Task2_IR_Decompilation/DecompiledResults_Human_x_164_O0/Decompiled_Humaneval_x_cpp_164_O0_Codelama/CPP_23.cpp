```
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int strlen(string str) {
    return str.length();
}

```

Note: The decompiled code is in C++, not C.

Explanation:

The provided IR code defines a function called `_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` that takes a `std::string` object as an argument and returns an `int` value. The function body consists of a single call to the `length()` method of the `std::string` class, which returns the length of the string.

The decompiled C++ code defines a function called `strlen` that takes a `std::string` object as an argument and returns an `int` value. The function body consists of a single call to the `length()` method of the `std::string` class, which returns the length of the string.

The decompiled code is equivalent to the original IR code, but it is written in C++ instead of IR.
