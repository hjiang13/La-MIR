I apologize, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program, and it requires a specific toolchain to decompile it into equivalent C or C++ source code.

If you have access to the toolchain that was used to generate the IR code, you can use it to decompile the code into C or C++. Alternatively, you can try using an online decompiler tool, such as the one provided by GodBolt, to decompile the IR code into C or C++.

Please note that the decompiled code may not be identical to the original source code, as the decompiler may not be able to perfectly reconstruct the original code from the IR. Additionally, the decompiled code may contain additional instructions or optimizations that were not present in the original source code.
