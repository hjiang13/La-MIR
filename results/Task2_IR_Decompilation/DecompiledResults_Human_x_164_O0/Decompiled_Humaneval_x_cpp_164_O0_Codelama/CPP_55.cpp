The provided IR code is for a function that takes an integer argument and returns an integer value. The function appears to be a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, where the first two values are 0 and 1, and each subsequent value is the sum of the previous two values.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
int fib(int n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  } else {
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
  }
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not the most efficient implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, as it uses recursion and recomputes the values for each call. A more efficient implementation would use a loop to compute the values and store them in an array for later use.
