I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a valid format. The code appears to be a mix of LLVM IR and x86 assembly code, which makes it difficult to decompile. Additionally, the code is incomplete and appears to be missing important information such as the function signature and the definition of the variables used in the code.

To decompile the code, I would need a complete and valid LLVM IR code, which I can then use to generate the corresponding C or C++ source code. If you have access to the original source code, I would recommend using a decompiler to generate the LLVM IR code, which can then be used to generate the C or C++ source code.

Alternatively, if you have access to the binary executable file, you can use a disassembler to generate the assembly code, which can then be used to generate the LLVM IR code. However, this process can be complex and may not always produce accurate results.

In summary, to decompile the provided IR code, I would need a complete and valid LLVM IR code, which I can then use to generate the corresponding C or C++ source code.
