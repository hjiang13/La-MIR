I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not a valid IR code. It is missing the necessary information such as the module name, the target triple, and the function definitions. Additionally, the code contains syntax errors and is not a valid LLVM IR code.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know and I'll be happy to help.
