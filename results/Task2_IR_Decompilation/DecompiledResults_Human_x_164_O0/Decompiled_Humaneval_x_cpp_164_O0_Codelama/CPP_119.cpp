I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. However, I can provide you with some general tips on how to decompile IR code:

1. Use a tool like the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) Viewer to visualize the IR code and understand its structure.
2. Identify the entry point of the code and start decompiling from there.
3. Look for patterns in the code that can help you identify the original source code. For example, look for loops, conditionals, and function calls.
4. Use a decompiler tool like the LLVM IR Decompiler to help you with the decompilation process.
5. Keep in mind that decompilation is not always possible, and the resulting source code may not be identical to the original.

I hope these tips are helpful. If you have any further questions or need more guidance, please let me know.
