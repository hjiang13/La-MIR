I am unable to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code appears to be in a binary format, which I am not able to process.

To decompile the IR code, I would need access to the original source code or the LLVM IR assembly code. Alternatively, you can use a tool such as the LLVM IR disassembler to convert the binary IR code into assembly code, which can then be decompiled.

Please provide me with the original source code or the LLVM IR assembly code, and I will be happy to help you with the decompilation.
