I am unable to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a valid format. The IR code should be in a human-readable format, with each instruction on a separate line and indented appropriately. Additionally, the code should include comments and labels to make it easier to understand.

If you have access to the original source code, I would recommend using a decompiler to generate the C or C++ source code from the IR code. There are several decompilers available, including the LLVM IR decompiler, the GCC IR decompiler, and the Clang IR decompiler. These decompilers can produce high-quality source code from IR code, but the results may vary depending on the complexity of the code and the decompiler used.

Alternatively, if you do not have access to the original source code, you may be able to reverse-engineer the code by analyzing the IR code and making educated guesses about the original source code. This can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, but it may be necessary in some cases where the original source code is not available.

In any case, I would recommend consulting with a qualified reverse engineer or decompiler expert to ensure that the decompiled code is accurate and reliable.
