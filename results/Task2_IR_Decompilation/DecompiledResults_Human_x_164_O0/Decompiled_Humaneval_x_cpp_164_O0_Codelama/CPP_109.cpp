Sure, I can help you with that. The provided IR code is for a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the vector contains a single ball that can be moved to the left or right to reach the other side of a gap.

Here's the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```c
bool move_one_ball(vector<int> &balls) {
  int left = 0;
  int right = 0;
  int size = balls.size();
  if (size == 0) {
    return false;
  }
  while (left < size && right < size) {
    if (balls[left] == 1) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right++;
    }
  }
  if (left == size || right == size) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```
The function first checks if the input vector is empty, and if so, returns false. Otherwise, it iterates through the vector and increments the `left` counter if the current element is 1, and increments the `right` counter if the current element is not 1. The function then checks if either `left` or `right` is equal to the size of the vector, and if so, returns true. If both `left` and `right` are less than the size of the vector, the function returns false.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
