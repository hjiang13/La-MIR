I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not a valid IR code. It is missing the necessary information such as the module name, the target triple, and the function definitions. Additionally, the code contains syntax errors and is not a valid LLVM IR code.

If you have any other questions or if you would like me to assist you with anything else, please feel free to ask.
