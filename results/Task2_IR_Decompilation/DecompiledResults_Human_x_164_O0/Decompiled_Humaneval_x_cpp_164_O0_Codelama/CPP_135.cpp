Sure, here's the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int can_arrange(vector<int> &arr) {
  int n = arr.size();
  int i, j, k;
  int count = 0;
  int flag = 0;

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
        flag = 1;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (flag == 0) {
      count++;
    }
    flag = 0;
  }

  if (count == n) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}

int main() {
  vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  if (can_arrange(arr)) {
    cout << "Yes, the array can be arranged in increasing order." << endl;
  } else {
    cout << "No, the array cannot be arranged in increasing order." << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}

Note that the decompiled code may not be exactly the same as the original source code, as the IR code may have been optimized or transformed in various ways during the compilation process. However, the decompiled code should still accurately represent the original program logic.
