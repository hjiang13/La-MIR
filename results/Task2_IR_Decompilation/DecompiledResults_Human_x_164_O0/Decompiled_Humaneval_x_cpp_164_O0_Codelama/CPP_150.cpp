The provided IR code is for a function that takes three integer arguments and returns an integer value. The function appears to be a simple implementation of the "xor" operation, where the return value is the bitwise XOR of the three input arguments.

Here is the decompiled C code for the provided IR code:
```
int x_or_y(int x, int y, int z) {
    return x ^ y ^ z;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is in C, not C++, as the provided IR code does not include any C++-specific features.
