The provided IR code is a function that takes two integer arguments and returns their sum. The function is defined in the LLVM IR dialect, which is a low-level, platform-independent representation of code.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code for the provided IR code:
```
int add(int a, int b) {
  int c = a + b;
  return c;
}
```
Note that the decompiled code is not exactly the same as the original C++ source code, but it is functionally equivalent. The decompiled code uses the same logic as the original code, but it is written in a different syntax and may include additional instructions or optimizations that are not present in the original code.
