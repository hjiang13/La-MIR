I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not a valid input. The IR code is a text-based representation of a program's assembly code, and it is not a programming language in itself. It is used by compilers and other tools to represent the assembly code in a more human-readable format.

If you have the IR code for a specific program, you can use a tool like the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) viewer to view the code and understand the program's structure and functionality. However, it is not possible to decompile the IR code into a programming language like C or C++ directly.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.
