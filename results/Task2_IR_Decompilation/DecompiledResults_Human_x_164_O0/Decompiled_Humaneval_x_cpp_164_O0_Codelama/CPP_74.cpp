I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. Additionally, I am not able to perform decompilation tasks as it is not within my programming capabilities. However, I can provide you with information on how to decompile code, and some tools that you can use to do so.

Decompilation is the process of converting machine code back into a higher-level programming language. There are several tools available that can perform decompilation, including:

1. IDA Pro: A popular disassembler and debugger that can also perform decompilation.
2. JD-GUI: A free, open-source decompiler for Java code.
3. dotPeek: A free, open-source decompiler for .NET code.
4. JADX: A free, open-source decompiler for Android apps.
5. Cutter: A free, open-source decompiler for C and C++ code.

It's important to note that decompilation is not always possible, and the resulting code may not be identical to the original source code. Additionally, decompilation can be a complex and time-consuming process, and may require a significant amount of expertise and knowledge.
