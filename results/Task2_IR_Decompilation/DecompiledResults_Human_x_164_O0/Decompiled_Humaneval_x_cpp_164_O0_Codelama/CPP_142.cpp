I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code because it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program, and it needs to be processed by a compiler or interpreter before it can be executed.

If you have access to the original source code, I would be happy to help you decompile it. Alternatively, you can try using a tool such as the LLVM IR decompiler to decompile the IR code. However, please note that decompilation is not always possible, and the resulting code may not be identical to the original source code.
