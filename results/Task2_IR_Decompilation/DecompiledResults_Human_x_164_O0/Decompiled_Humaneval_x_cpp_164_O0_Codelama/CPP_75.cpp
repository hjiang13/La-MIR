The provided IR code is a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value. The function is designed to check if the input integer is a prime number or not.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the provided IR code:
```
#include <iostream>

bool is_multiply_prime(int num) {
    if (num <= 1) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i < num; i++) {
        if (num % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
Explanation:

The function starts by checking if the input integer is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns false, indicating that the input is not a prime number.

Next, the function enters a loop that iterates from 2 to the input integer. Inside the loop, the function checks if the input integer is divisible by the current iteration value. If it is, the function returns false, indicating that the input is not a prime number.

If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns true, indicating that the input is a prime number.

Note that the decompiled code is not optimized, and it may not be the most efficient implementation of the function. However, it accurately represents the logic of the provided IR code.
