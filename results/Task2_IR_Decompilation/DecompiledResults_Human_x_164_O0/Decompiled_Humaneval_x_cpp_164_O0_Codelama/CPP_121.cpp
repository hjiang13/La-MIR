The provided IR code is for a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be a solution to a problem that involves finding the number of pairs of matching brackets in a given string.

Here is the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
int solutions(vector<int> &v) {
  int size = v.size();
  int i = 0;
  int j = 0;
  int count = 0;
  while (i < size) {
    if (v[i] == 1) {
      j = i + 1;
      while (j < size && v[j] != 1) {
        j++;
      }
      if (j < size) {
        count++;
        i = j + 1;
      } else {
        i++;
      }
    } else {
      i++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```
The decompiled code is a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns an integer. The function appears to be a solution to a problem that involves finding the number of pairs of matching brackets in a given string.

The function starts by initializing three variables: `size`, `i`, and `j`. `size` is set to the size of the input vector, `i` is set to 0, and `j` is set to 0.

The function then enters a while loop that iterates over the input vector. The loop starts by checking if the current element is equal to 1. If it is, the loop sets `j` to the index of the next element that is equal to 1. If no such element is found, the loop sets `j` to the size of the input vector.

The loop then checks if `j` is less than the size of the input vector. If it is, the loop increments `count` and sets `i` to the index of the next element that is equal to 1. If no such element is found, the loop sets `i` to the size of the input vector.

The loop then increments `i` and repeats the process until the end of the input vector is reached.

Finally, the function returns `count`, which represents the number of pairs of matching brackets in the input string.
