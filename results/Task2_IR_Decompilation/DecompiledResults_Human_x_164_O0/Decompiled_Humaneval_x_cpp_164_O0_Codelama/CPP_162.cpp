Sure, I can help you with that. The provided IR code is for a function that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the brackets in the string are correctly matched.

Here's the decompiled C++ code for the function:
```
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool correct_bracketing(string brackets) {
    int level = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < brackets.length(); i++) {
        if (brackets[i] == '(') {
            level++;
        } else if (brackets[i] == ')') {
            level--;
        }
        if (level < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    if (level != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
The function takes a string as input and iterates through each character in the string. If the character is an opening bracket, the level of nesting is incremented. If the character is a closing bracket, the level of nesting is decremented. If the level of nesting is ever negative, it means that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, so the function returns false. If the level of nesting is not zero at the end of the iteration, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets, so the function returns false. If the level of nesting is zero and the iteration completes without returning false, it means that the brackets are correctly matched, so the function returns true.
