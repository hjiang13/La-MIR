I'm sorry, but I cannot decompile the provided IR code because it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program, and it is not in a form that can be easily decompiled into C or C++ source code.

To decompile the IR code, I would need access to the original source code or a tool that can decompile the IR code into a higher-level representation. However, I am not able to access the original source code or use any decompilation tools.

If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.
