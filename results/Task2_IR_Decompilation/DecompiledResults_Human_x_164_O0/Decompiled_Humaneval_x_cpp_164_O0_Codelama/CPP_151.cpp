I am not able to decompile the provided IR code as it is not in a format that I can understand. The IR code appears to be in a binary format, and I am only able to process text-based input.

If you could provide the IR code in a text-based format, such as assembly code or a human-readable representation of the binary data, I would be happy to try and decompile it for you.
