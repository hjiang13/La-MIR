Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's see, the function is called _Z10choose_numii, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Maybe it translates to "choose_num" with two integer parameters. 

Looking at the IR code, it starts by allocating space for three integers. Then it stores the two input parameters into two of those allocated spaces. So, I guess those are the variables a and b.

The first comparison is if b is less than a. If that's true, it stores -1 into the result variable and jumps to the end. So that's the first condition: if b < a, return -1.

If b is not less than a, the next part checks if b equals a. If they're equal, it goes into a block where it checks if a is odd. If a is odd (remainder when divided by 2 is 1), it stores -1 again. Otherwise, it just stores b into the result.

Wait, no, looking again, if b equals a, it checks if a is odd. If yes, return -1, else return a. But if b is not equal to a, it proceeds to check if b is odd. If b is odd, it subtracts 1 from b and stores that as the result. Otherwise, it just stores b.

So putting it all together, the function seems to return -1 if b < a or if b equals a and a is odd. If b is greater than a and a is even, it returns a. If b is greater than a and b is odd, it returns b-1. If b is greater than a and even, returns b.

I think I can structure the C++ code to reflect these conditions step by step. Maybe using if-else statements to handle each case as per the IR logic.

To decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the structure and translate each part into corresponding C++ constructs. The function `_Z10choose_numii` is a C++ function with two `int` parameters. The IR code can be translated as follows:

1. **Function Definition**: The mangled name `_Z10choose_numii` corresponds to a function named `choose_num` taking two `int` parameters.
2. **Variable Allocation**: The function allocates three integers, which we can represent as local variables `a`, `b`, and `result`.
3. **Condition Checks**: The IR code performs several conditional checks comparing the two parameters and checks for parity (even or odd).
4. **Return Values**: Based on the conditions, the function returns specific values, either `-1` or one of the parameters adjusted by decrementing if necessary.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    int result;
    if (b < a) {
        result = -1;
    } else if (b == a) {
        if (a % 2 == 1) {
            result = -1;
        } else {
            result = a;
        }
    } else { // b > a
        if (b % 2 == 1) {
            result = b - 1;
        } else {
            result = b;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << choose_num(5, 3) << std::endl;  // Output: -1
    std::cout << choose_num(4, 4) << std::endl;  // Output: 4
    std::cout << choose_num(3, 5) << std::endl;  // Output: 4
    std::cout << choose_num(6, 8) << std::endl;  // Output: 8
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:

- **Function Definition**: The function `choose_num` takes two integers `a` and `b`.
- **Condition Checks**:
  - If `b` is less than `a`, return `-1`.
  - If `b` equals `a`, check if `a` is odd. If true, return `-1`; otherwise, return `a`.
  - If `b` is greater than `a`, check if `b` is odd. If true, return `b - 1`; otherwise, return `b`.
- **Main Function**: Provides example usage to demonstrate the function's behavior.

This C++ code accurately reflects the logic present in the provided LLVM IR code and can be compiled and run directly.
