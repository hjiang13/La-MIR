Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code that I need to decompile into C or C++ source code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read through the IR code to understand what it's doing. The function is named @_Z8is_primex, which I think translates to is_prime in C++. The function takes an i64 (a 64-bit integer) and returns an i1, which is a boolean.

Looking at the structure, the function starts by allocating space for a boolean (%2) and two 64-bit integers (%3 and %4). Then it stores the input into %3. Next, it loads that value and checks if it's less than 2. If it is, it stores false and exits. That makes sense because primes are greater than 1.

If the number is 2 or more, it initializes %4 to 2. Then there's a loop where it multiplies the current value of %4 by itself and compares it to the input. If the square is larger than the input, it sets the result to true. Otherwise, it checks if the input is divisible by the current %4. If it is, it's not a prime, so it sets the result to false. If not, it increments %4 by 1 and loops again.

Putting this together, it looks like a standard trial division method for checking primes. It checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.

Now, I'll try to write the C++ function based on this logic. The function is_prime should take a long long n and return a bool. It should handle n < 2 by returning false. Then, starting from 2, it checks each number up to sqrt(n). If any divide n, it's not prime. If none do, it is prime.

I need to make sure the loop doesn't run unnecessarily. For even numbers greater than 2, it can directly return false. Wait, the current IR code doesn't handle even numbers specially, so maybe the code I'm writing shouldn't either to stay accurate. Or perhaps it's better to optimize it, but since the IR doesn't do that, I'll stick to the same approach.

So, the code will have a loop starting at 2, checking up to sqrt(n), and return true if no divisors are found. That should match the IR's behavior.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the C++ code accordingly.

The provided LLVM IR code corresponds to a function `is_prime` that checks if a given 64-bit integer is a prime number. The function uses a trial division method to determine primality. Below is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

bool is_prime(long long n) {
    if (n < 2) {
        return false;
    }

    long long i = 2;
    while (true) {
        long long square = i * i;
        if (square > n) {
            return true;
        }

        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }

        i++;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Check**: The function immediately returns `false` for numbers less than 2 since they are not prime.

2. **Loop Setup**: The loop starts with `i` set to 2 and continues indefinitely until a return condition is met.

3. **Square Check**: In each iteration, the square of `i` is computed. If this square exceeds `n`, the function returns `true`, indicating `n` is prime.

4. **Divisibility Check**: If `n` is divisible by `i`, the function returns `false` as `n` is not prime.

5. **Increment**: If neither condition is met, `i` is incremented, and the loop continues.

This code accurately reflects the logic present in the provided LLVM IR, implementing an efficient trial division method for primality testing.
