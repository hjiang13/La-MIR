Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding the IR code structure.

First, I see that the module is related to a vector of floats. There's a function called _Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE, which I think is the function I need to focus on. The name suggests it's summing squares, so probably sum of squares of vector elements.

Looking at the function, it starts by allocating two integers, initializing them to 0. One seems to be the loop index and the other the sum. Then it enters a loop where it checks if the current index is less than the vector size.

Inside the loop, it's accessing elements of the vector using _ZNSt6vectorIfSaIfEEixEm, which is the operator[] function. It's getting the elements at the current index and the next one. Each element is passed to _ZSt4ceilf, which is the ceil function. Then it multiplies the two ceiled values and adds them to the sum.

Wait, but in the code, it's using the same index for both elements. Let me check again. Oh, no, the first load uses %11, which is the same as the current index, and then for the second element, it's using %16, which is also the same index. So it's taking the same element twice, applying ceil each time, multiplying, and adding to the sum. That seems a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding in the IR.

Wait, maybe the second element is actually the next element. Let me see: the loop increments the index each time, so perhaps the code is using the current element and the next one. But in the IR, both loads are using the same index. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to adjust that in the C++ code.

In any case, the function returns the sum after processing all elements. So the C++ function should take a vector of floats, loop through each element, apply ceil to each, square them, and sum all.

Wait, the original function name is sum_squares, so maybe it's summing the squares of each element after applying ceil. So each element is ceiled, then squared, then added to the sum.

In the IR, the function is using two elements each time, but maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps it's summing the product of each element and the next, but that seems less likely. I think it's more plausible that it's summing the squares of each element after applying ceil.

So in the C++ code, I'll loop through each element, apply ceil, square it, and add to the sum. That makes sense.

I'll write a function that takes a const reference to a vector of floats. Inside, initialize sum to 0. Loop from 0 to size-1, for each i, get v[i], apply ceil, square, add to sum. Return sum.

Wait, but in the IR, the function is called _Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE, which in C++ would be something like int sum_squares(const std::vector<float>& v). The return type is i32, which is int in C++. So the function returns an int, which is the sum.

Putting it all together, the C++ code should look like that.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code based on the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int sum_squares(const vector<float>& v) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
        float a = v[i];
        a = ceilf(a);
        sum += static_cast<int>(a * a);
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This code defines a function `sum_squares` that takes a `const vector<float>&` as input. It initializes a sum variable to 0, then iterates over each element in the vector. For each element, it applies the `ceilf` function, squares the result, converts it to an integer, and adds it to the sum. Finally, the function returns the computed sum.
