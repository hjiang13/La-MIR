Alright, I'm trying to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the IR code is doing.

First, I notice there's a function called `will_it_fly` that takes a `std::vector<int>` and an integer. The function returns a boolean. Inside this function, there are several loops and condition checks.

Looking at the IR, the function uses a loop that iterates until the loop variable `i` (stored in `%6`) reaches the end of the vector. It accesses elements of the vector using `operator[]` through the `vector::operator[]` function calls. 

In the loop, it's comparing elements at positions `i` and `size-1 - i`. If any pair of elements isn't equal, it sets a flag and breaks out of the loop. After the loop, it checks if the sum of elements meets a certain condition and returns `true` or `false` accordingly.

I also see helper functions for `vector::size()` and `vector::operator[]`, which are standard, so I can focus on the main function.

Putting it all together, the C++ code should:

1. Initialize variables to track the loop and sum.
2. Loop through the first half of the vector, comparing symmetric elements.
3. If any comparison fails, return `false`.
4. After the loop, check if the sum meets the condition and return the result.

I'll structure the code accordingly, ensuring all variables are correctly initialized and the logic flows as per the IR.

Here is the decompiled C++ code based on the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool will_it_fly(vector<int> vec, int size) {
    bool result = true;
    int sum = 0;
    int i = 0;

    while (true) {
        if (i >= vec.size()) break;

        int a = vec[i];
        int b = vec[vec.size() - 1 - i];

        if (a != b) {
            result = false;
            break;
        }

        sum += a;

        i++;
    }

    if (sum > size) {
        result = false;
    }

    return result;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition**: The function `will_it_fly` takes a `vector<int>` and an `int size` as parameters and returns a `bool`.

2. **Variable Initialization**: 
   - `result` is initialized to `true` and will store the final boolean result.
   - `sum` is used to accumulate the sum of elements.
   - `i` is the loop counter.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `i` exceeds the size of the vector.
   - For each iteration, it retrieves elements `a` at index `i` and `b` at the symmetric position from the end (`size - 1 - i`).
   - If `a` and `b` are not equal, `result` is set to `false`, and the loop exits.

4. **Sum Check**:
   - After the loop, if `sum` exceeds `size`, `result` is set to `false`.

5. **Return Statement**: The function returns the final `result`.

This code should match the behavior described by the provided LLVM IR.
