Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR is doing.

Looking at the function definition, it's a boolean function called simplify that takes two std::__cxx11::basic_string pointers. The function has several loops and string operations.

First, I see the function allocates several variables: a boolean, and five integers. Then it initializes a counter (i32* %8) to 0.

There's a loop starting at label 13. It loads the counter, checks if it's less than the size of the first string. If so, it gets the character at the current index. If the character is 47 (which is '/' in ASCII), it proceeds to split the string into two parts using substr, converts them to integers using atoi, and stores them in variables %4 and %5. Then it increments the counter.

Similarly, after processing the first string, the loop resets the counter to 0 and does the same for the second string, storing values in %6 and %7.

After processing both strings, it calculates the product of the first pair and the second pair. It then checks if the remainder of the division of these products is zero. If yes, returns true; else, false.

So, putting this together, the function is checking if the product of two pairs from the first string divides the product of two pairs from the second string exactly.

The C++ code would involve splitting each string on '/' into two parts, converting each part to integers, computing the products, and checking the divisibility.

I should write the code using string streams or find '/' to split the strings. Using istringstream would be a clean approach. For each string, read two integers, compute the product, then check if the first product divides the second evenly.

I'll structure the code with two helper functions to parse each string into two integers. Then, compute the products and return whether the first product divides the second without a remainder.

Make sure to handle cases where the strings might not contain exactly two integers, but the original code seems to assume valid input.

Finally, I'll test the code to ensure it behaves as expected, returning true when the condition is met and false otherwise.

Here's the decompiled C++ code that corresponds to the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

using namespace std;

bool simplify(string* str1, string* str2) {
    int a, b, c, d;
    istringstream iss1(*str1);
    istringstream iss2(*str2);
    
    // Parse first string
    iss1 >> a >> b;
    // Parse second string
    iss2 >> c >> d;
    
    int product1 = a * b;
    int product2 = c * d;
    
    return (product1 % product2) == 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `simplify` takes two C++ strings by pointer and returns a boolean.

2. **String Parsing**: It uses `istringstream` to parse each string into two integer values. The first string is split into `a` and `b`, and the second into `c` and `d`.

3. **Product Calculation**: It calculates the product of the two integers from each string.

4. **Divisibility Check**: The function returns `true` if the product of the first pair divides the product of the second pair without a remainder, otherwise `false`.

### Usage Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    string str1 = "4/2";
    string str2 = "8/4";
    
    bool result = simplify(&str1, &str2);
    cout << "Result: " << (result ? "True" : "False") << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code assumes that the input strings are properly formatted with exactly two integers separated by a slash ('/'). The function will return `true` if the product of the first pair divides the second product exactly, and `false` otherwise.
