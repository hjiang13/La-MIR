Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the IR, the main function is `_Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIEE`, which I know translates to a boolean function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as an argument. 

The function initializes two variables, `i` and `j`, starting at 0. It then enters a loop where it checks if `i` is less than the size of the vector. Inside this loop, it initializes `j` to `i + 1` and enters another loop checking if `j` is less than the vector's size. 

Within the inner loop, it loads the elements at indices `i` and `j`, adds them together, and checks if their sum equals zero. If it does, the function stores `true` and exits. If the inner loop completes without finding such a pair, it increments `i` and continues. If no pairs are found after all iterations, it returns `false`.

I notice that the IR uses two loops: the outer loop iterates over each element, and the inner loop checks all subsequent elements for a pair summing to zero. This is a common approach to find pairs in a vector.

Now, I'll translate this logic into C++. I'll declare a boolean variable `result` initialized to `false`. I'll use two nested for loops: the outer loop with `i` starting at 0, and the inner loop with `j` starting at `i + 1`. Inside the inner loop, I'll check if `vec[i] + vec[j]` equals zero. If it does, I'll set `result` to `true` and break out of both loops using a goto statement for efficiency. If no pairs are found, `result` remains `false`.

I need to make sure the function signature matches, taking a `const std::vector<int>&` to avoid unnecessary copying. I'll also include the necessary headers, like `<vector>` and `<utility>`, though in this case, `<utility>` might not be needed since we're not using any utility functions beyond what's in the IR.

Finally, I'll structure the code with proper indentation and comments if necessary, but since the code is straightforward, it should be clear without them. I'll test the function with some sample inputs to ensure it behaves as expected, such as returning `true` for a vector containing `-5` and `5`, and `false` when no such pairs exist.

I can help you decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's analyze the code step by step.

The IR code represents a function named `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a `std::vector<int>` as input and returns a boolean (`i1` type in IR). The function checks if there exists at least one pair of elements in the vector whose sum equals zero.

Here's the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool pairs_sum_to_zero(const vector<int>& vec) {
    bool result = false;
    int size = vec.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < size; ++j) {
            if (vec[i] + vec[j] == 0) {
                result = true;
                goto end; // Jump out of both loops
            }
        }
    }
    
end:
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `pairs_sum_to_zero` takes a `const std::vector<int>&` as input and returns a boolean.
2. **Initialization**: A boolean variable `result` is initialized to `false`.
3. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over each element in the vector using index `i`.
4. **Inner Loop**: For each `i`, iterates over subsequent elements using index `j` (starting from `i + 1`).
5. **Sum Check**: Checks if the sum of `vec[i]` and `vec[j]` equals zero. If true, sets `result` to `true` and jumps out of both loops using `goto end`.
6. **End Label**: Exits both loops and returns the result.

This code efficiently checks for pairs of elements that sum to zero without modifying the input vector, using a nested loop approach similar to the IR code.
