Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code that I need to decompile into C++ source code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. 

First, I'll look at the function definition. The function is named @_Z6fibfibi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find that it translates to "fib(int)". So, the function is called fib and takes an integer as an argument.

Looking at the IR code, I see several alloca instructions. The first one allocates space for an i32, which is probably an integer variable. The second alloca is for an array of 100 i32s, so that's an integer array of size 100. The third alloca is another i32, maybe a counter or index variable.

Next, there are several store instructions. The first store saves the input parameter %0 into the first allocated space, which I'll call n. Then, the code initializes the first three elements of the array. The first element is 0, the second is 0, and the third is 1. So, the array starts with [0, 0, 1].

The variable %4 is initialized to 3. I think this is a loop counter starting at 3. Then there's a branch to label 8, which seems to be the start of a loop.

In the loop (label 8), it loads the counter and n. It checks if the counter is less than or equal to n. If not, it exits the loop. Otherwise, it proceeds to compute the next Fibonacci number.

Looking at the computation part, it subtracts 1 from the counter to get the previous index, loads the value from the array, subtracts 2 to get the one before that, loads that value, adds them together, then subtracts 3 to get another previous index, loads that value, adds it to the previous sum, and stores the result back into the array at the current counter index.

After updating the array, the counter is incremented by 1, and the loop continues until the counter exceeds n. Finally, it loads the value at index n from the array and returns it.

Putting this together, I see that it's a Fibonacci function that uses an array to store previous values, likely for efficiency. It initializes the first few elements and then iterates from 3 up to n, calculating each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding ones.

I also notice that it's using an array of fixed size 100, which means n can't be larger than 100. If someone passes a number bigger than 100, it might cause an out-of-bounds access, but the original code probably expects n to be within this limit.

So, the C++ code should have a function fib that takes an integer n, initializes an array of 100 integers, sets the first three values, loops from 3 to n, computes each Fibonacci number, and returns the nth value.

I need to make sure the array is properly initialized and that the loop correctly updates each element. Also, I should handle cases where n is 0, 1, or 2 by returning the initialized values directly.

Wait, in the IR, the array is initialized with indices 0, 1, and 2. So for n less than 3, the function should return the corresponding value without entering the loop. The loop starts at 3, so if n is 0, 1, or 2, it just returns fib[0], fib[1], or fib[2], which are 0, 0, and 1 respectively.

I should also check if the loop correctly stops when the counter exceeds n. In the IR, the condition is %9 = load i32, i32* %4, align 4 and %10 = load i32, i32* %2, align 4, then %11 = icmp sle i32 %9, %10. So if the counter is <= n, it continues; else, it exits.

Putting all this together, I can write the C++ function with the array, initialization, loop, and return statement. I'll make sure the array is properly sized and that all accesses are within bounds.

I think that's the gist of it. Now, I'll try to write the C++ code based on this understanding.

The provided LLVM IR code implements a Fibonacci function using an array to store intermediate values, which is a common optimization technique. The function initializes the first few Fibonacci numbers and iterates up to the input number `n`, computing each subsequent number as the sum of the two preceding ones. Here's the decompiled C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    int* fib = new int[100];  // Allocate an array of 100 integers
    
    // Initialize the first three Fibonacci numbers
    fib[0] = 0;
    fib[1] = 0;
    fib[2] = 1;
    
    int i = 3;  // Start the loop from 3
    
    while (i <= n) {
        // Compute the next Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous two
        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2] + fib[i-3];
        i++;
    }
    
    int result = fib[n];
    delete[] fib;  // Deallocate the array
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10;  // Example input
    cout << "Fibonacci number at position " << n << " is: " << fib(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Memory Allocation:** The function allocates an array of 100 integers to store Fibonacci numbers up to the 100th position.

2. **Initialization:** The first three positions of the array are initialized with `fib[0] = 0`, `fib[1] = 0`, and `fib[2] = 1`.

3. **Loop and Calculation:** Starting from index 3, each Fibonacci number is calculated as the sum of the three preceding numbers (`fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2] + fib[i-3]`). This pattern continues up to the input number `n`.

4. **Result Retrieval:** After computing up to `n`, the function retrieves `fib[n]` and returns it.

5. **Memory Management:** The dynamically allocated array is deleted to prevent memory leaks.

This implementation efficiently computes Fibonacci numbers using an array to store previous values, reducing redundant calculations and optimizing performance.
