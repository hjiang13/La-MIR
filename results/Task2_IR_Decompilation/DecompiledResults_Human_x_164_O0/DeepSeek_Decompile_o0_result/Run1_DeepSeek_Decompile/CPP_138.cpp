Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by looking at the given IR code carefully.

The function is called `_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni`, which looks like a mangled C++ name. I remember that in C++, when functions are compiled, their names get mangled to include type information. So I need to demangle this name to understand what the function is called in the original code. Using a demangler, I find that it translates to `is_equal_to_sum_even(int)`. So the function is probably checking if an integer meets some condition related to being even or a sum.

Looking at the IR, the function takes an `i32` argument, which is a 32-bit integer. The function returns a `zeroext i1`, which is a boolean. So the function returns true or false based on some condition involving the input integer.

In the IR, the function starts by allocating space for a boolean (`%2`) and an integer (`%3`). It then stores the input into `%3` and loads it back into `%4`. It computes the remainder when `%4` is divided by 2 using `srem`, which gives the modulo operation. Then it checks if this remainder is equal to zero with `icmp eq`, which will be true if the number is even.

So far, it seems like the function is checking if the number is even. But then there's a branch based on this condition. If it's even, it goes to label 7, otherwise to label 11. Wait, but label 7 has another condition: it loads the number again and checks if it's greater than or equal to 8 using `icmp sge`. If that's true, it stores true into `%2`, else it goes to label 11 where it stores false.

So putting it together, the function returns true only if the number is even AND greater than or equal to 8. Otherwise, it returns false.

Wait, let me double-check. The first condition is if the number is even. If it is, then it checks if it's >=8. So if both are true, return true. If it's even but less than 8, it returns false. If it's not even, it returns false. So the function is checking if the number is even and at least 8.

That makes sense. So the C++ function would take an integer, check if it's even and >=8, and return a bool accordingly.

So the original C++ code should look something like:

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int x) {
    if (x % 2 == 0 && x >= 8) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

But wait, maybe it's written with separate checks. Let me see the IR again. The function first checks if x is even, then if it's >=8. So it's two separate conditions, both must be met for true.

So the C++ code should reflect that logic.

The decompiled C++ function is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int x) {
    if (x % 2 == 0) {
        if (x >= 8) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << is_equal_to_sum_even(10) << std::endl;  // Outputs: true
    std::cout << is_equal_to_sum_even(7) << std::endl;   // Outputs: false
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `is_equal_to_sum_even` that returns `true` if the input integer is even and greater than or equal to 8, and `false` otherwise. The `main` function provides example usage of this function.
