<think>
Okay, so I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. 

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. The function is named @_Z15is_simple_powerii, which I think is a C++ function. The demangled name would probably be is_simple_power(int, int). The function returns a bool (i1) and takes two integers as arguments.

Looking at the code, I see several alloca instructions. They're allocating space on the stack for the variables. %3 is a bool, and %4, %5, %6, %7 are integers. Then they store the input parameters %0 and %1 into %4 and %5, respectively. They also initialize %6 to 1 and %7 to 0. So, I think %4 is base, %5 is exponent, %6 is a counter starting at 1, and %7 is another counter starting at 0.

The function then enters a loop. The loop starts at label 8. It loads %6 and %4, compares if %6 is less than or equal to %4. If true, it goes to label 12, else to 15. 

At label 12, it loads %7, checks if it's less than 100, and then goes to label 15. At label 15, there's a phi node. The phi node takes false if coming from 8, or the result of the comparison from 12. So, if the initial check at 8 failed, it's false, else it depends on whether %7 is less than 100.

If %16 (the result of the phi) is true, it goes to label 17, else to 28. Label 17 is where the loop body starts. It checks if %6 equals %4. If so, it stores true in %3 and exits the loop. If not, it multiplies %6 by %5 and increments %7 by 1, then loops back.

If the loop exits because the condition failed, it stores false in %3. Finally, it loads the result from %3 and returns it.

Putting this together, the function seems to check if the base raised to some exponent equals the given power, but with some constraints. Let me try to translate this into C++.

So, the function is_simple_power(int base, int power) returns a bool. It initializes result to 1 and count to 0. It loops while result is less than or equal to base. Inside the loop, if result equals base, it returns true. Otherwise, it multiplies result by power and increments count, but only if count is less than 100.

Wait, but in the IR, the loop has a condition based on count < 100. So, it's checking whether after multiplying, the count is still under 100. If not, it exits and returns false. So, the function is checking whether base^count equals power, but only up to 100 iterations.

Let me write the C++ code accordingly. Initialize result as 1, count as 0. Loop while result <= power. If result equals power, return true. Else, multiply result by base, increment count. If count exceeds 100, break and return false.

Wait, but the loop in IR has two conditions: result <= base and count < 100. So, in C++, the loop should continue as long as result <= base and count < 100. Also, each time through the loop, result is multiplied by base, and count increases.

Wait, looking back, in the IR, after the initial check, it's checking if count is less than 100. So, the loop runs while result <= base and count < 100. So, the C++ loop should have both conditions.

Wait, no. The IR's loop is structured a bit differently. It starts by checking if the current result is <= base. If so, it checks if count is <100. If either condition fails, it exits the loop.

So, in the C++ code, the loop runs while result <= base and count < 100. Inside the loop, if result equals base, return true. Otherwise, multiply result by base and increment count.

Wait, but in the IR, the multiplication happens after the check. So, the initial result is 1, then in the first iteration, it becomes base^1, then base^2, etc.

So, the function is checking whether base raised to some exponent (starting from 1) equals the given power, but only up to 100 times. So, if within 100 steps, the result equals the power, return true; else, false.

Putting it all together, the C++ function would be something like:

bool is_simple_power(int base, int power) {
    bool result = false;
    int current = 1;
    int count = 0;
    while (current <= base && count < 100) {
        if (current == base) {
            result = true;
            break;
        }
        current *= power;
        count++;
    }
    return result;
}

Wait, but in the IR, the initial current is 1, and it's multiplied by power each time, not base. Oh, wait, in the IR, %5 is the second argument, which is power. So, in C++, the function would multiply current by power each time, not base.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if base is say 2 and power is 3, then 2^3 is 8, but the function as written would compute 1*3=3, then 3*3=9, which exceeds 8. So, it would return false, which is incorrect.

Ah, I think I made a mistake. The function is supposed to check if the power is a simple power of the base, meaning that power should be equal to base^k for some integer k. So, the function should compute base^k and see if it equals the given power.

Wait, but in the IR code, the function is using the second argument (power) as the multiplier. So, perhaps I got the parameters mixed up. Let me check the IR again.

In the IR, %0 is stored into %4, which is base. %1 is stored into %5, which is power. Then, in the loop, %6 is multiplied by %5 (power). So, the function is checking whether base can be expressed as (power)^k, but that seems odd. Maybe I have the parameters reversed.

Wait, perhaps the function is checking whether 'base' is a simple power of 'power', meaning base = power^k. So, in that case, the function would compute power^k and see if it equals base.

But usually, functions like is_simple_power would take (base, power) and check if 'power' is a simple power of 'base', i.e., power = base^k. So, perhaps there's a mix-up in the parameters.

Let me think again. The function in the IR is:

current starts at 1.

Loop while current <= base and count < 100:

   if current == base, return true.

   current *= power

   count++

So, it's checking whether power^k equals base for some k, up to 100.

But that would mean the function is checking if base is a power of power, which is the opposite of what is usually intended.

Alternatively, perhaps the parameters are (power, base), but that would be unconventional.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is correct as is, but I need to adjust the C++ code accordingly.

So, in the C++ code, the function would take (int base, int power), and compute power^k, checking if it equals base.

But that seems counterintuitive. Normally, you'd have power = base^k.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and in the C++ code, the function should be using base as the multiplier, not power. Let me check the IR again.

Looking at the IR, in the loop:

%23 = load i32, i32* %6, align 4 (which is current)
%24 = load i32, i32* %5, align 4 (which is power)
%25 = mul nsw i32 %23, %24
store i32 %25, i32* %6, align 4 (current = current * power)

So, yes, current is being multiplied by power each time.

So, the function is checking if base is equal to power^k for some k, up to 100 iterations.

So, in C++, the function would look like:

bool is_simple_power(int base, int power) {
    int current = 1;
    int count = 0;
    while (current <= base && count < 100) {
        if (current == base) {
            return true;
        }
        current *= power;
        count++;
    }
    return false;
}

Wait, but in the IR, the function has 'count' starting at 0, and the loop continues as long as current <= base and count < 100. So, the loop runs while both conditions are true. So, in C++, the loop condition is current <= base && count < 100.

But wait, in the IR, the loop is structured with a phi node that combines the two conditions. So, the loop continues as long as either the current is <= base or the count is <100. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, in the IR, the loop starts at label 8. It checks if current <= base. If yes, it goes to label 12, which checks if count < 100. Then, the phi node at label 15 combines the two conditions. So, if the initial current <= base is false, the phi is false, so it exits the loop. Else, it checks count < 100, and if that's true, continues the loop.

So, the loop runs as long as current <= base and count < 100.

So, in C++, the loop condition should be (current <= base) && (count < 100).

Alternatively, the loop could be written as a while loop with that condition.

Putting it all together, the C++ function is as I wrote above.

I think that's the correct decompilation.
</think>

The provided LLVM IR code defines a function `is_simple_power` that checks if a given `base` can be expressed as `power` raised to some integer exponent within a maximum of 100 iterations. Here's the equivalent C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool is_simple_power(int base, int power) {
    int current = 1;
    int count = 0;
    while (current <= base && count < 100) {
        if (current == base) {
            return true;
        }
        current *= power;
        count++;
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << is_simple_power(16, 2) << std::endl;  // Should print: true because 2^4 = 16
    std::cout << is_simple_power(20, 2) << std::endl;  // Should print: false because 2^4=16 <20, 2^5=32>20
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code accurately reflects the logic of the provided LLVM IR, checking if `base` is a power of `power` within 100 iterations.
