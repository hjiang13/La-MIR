Alright, I need to decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the IR code is doing. 

First, I'll look at the function definition. The function is named @_Z4fib4i, which when demangled translates to a function named fib taking an integer and returning an integer. So the function signature is int fib(int).

Looking at the IR, I see several alloca instructions, which suggest that memory is being allocated on the stack. There are allocations for an i32, a [100 x i32] array, and another i32. This indicates that the function is using a local array of 100 integers, likely to store Fibonacci sequence values iteratively.

The initial stores set the first few elements of the array. The first store sets index 0 to 0, then index 1 to 0, index 2 to 2, and index 3 to 0. After that, a variable (stored at %4) is initialized to 4. 

There's a loop starting at label 9. The loop condition checks if the variable at %4 is less than or equal to the input value at %2. If true, it proceeds to compute the next Fibonacci number. The loop increments this variable until it exceeds the input value.

Inside the loop, it calculates the current Fibonacci number by summing the previous three numbers. This is done by loading values from the array, adding them, and storing the result back into the array. The loop then increments the variable and continues.

Once the loop exits, the function loads the value from the array at the index specified by the input and returns it.

Putting this together, the function initializes the first few Fibonacci numbers and iteratively computes each subsequent number up to the input value, storing each in an array. Finally, it returns the nth Fibonacci number from the array.

I need to translate this logic into C++. The array will be declared with a size of 100, initialized with the first four values as per the IR. Then, a loop runs from 4 up to n, computing each Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous three. The function then returns fib[n].

I should handle cases where n is less than the initialized values to avoid unnecessary computation. Also, ensuring that the loop starts correctly and doesn't exceed the array bounds is important.

Now, I'll write the C++ code that mirrors this behavior. The function will take an integer n, initialize the array, fill it iteratively, and return the nth value.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the IR and map it back to its high-level C++ equivalent. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Function Signature**: The IR defines a function `@_Z4fib4i`, which is the mangled name for a function named `fib` that takes an integer and returns an integer. Demangling gives `int fib(int)`.

2. **Analyze Memory Allocation**: The IR allocates memory for an integer, an array of 100 integers, and another integer. This translates to local variables in C++.

3. **Track Variable Initialization**: The initial stores set up the first few elements of the array and a counter variable. This corresponds to initializing the array with specific values and a loop counter.

4. **Understand the Loop Structure**: The loop runs while the counter is less than or equal to the input value. Inside the loop, the function computes the next Fibonacci number by summing the previous three values and stores it in the array.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop completes, the function returns the value from the array at the index corresponding to the input parameter.

Based on this analysis, the C++ code can be reconstructed as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    int fib[100];
    fib[0] = 0;
    fib[1] = 0;
    fib[2] = 2;
    fib[3] = 0;
    int i = 4;

    while (i <= n) {
        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2] + fib[i-3];
        i++;
    }

    return fib[n];
}

int main() {
    int result = fib(3);
    cout << "Fibonacci number: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `fib` that computes the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with an array to store intermediate values. The `main` function demonstrates its usage by computing the 3rd Fibonacci number and printing it.

**Explanation of the Decompilation**:

- **Memory Allocation**: The IR's `alloca` instructions correspond to local variable declarations in C++. The array `fib` is declared with a size of 100.
- **Loop Structure**: The IR's branch instructions and labels are translated into a `while` loop in C++. The loop continues until the counter `i` exceeds the input `n`.
- **Array Initialization and Updates**: The initial stores in the IR set the first few elements of the array. The loop body in the IR, which loads previous values, adds them, and stores the result, is translated into a single line in C++ that updates `fib[i]`.
- **Return Statement**: The IR's `ret` instruction corresponds to the `return` statement in C++, retrieving the value from the array at index `n`.

This decompilation accurately reflects the behavior of the original IR code, providing a clear and functional C++ implementation.
