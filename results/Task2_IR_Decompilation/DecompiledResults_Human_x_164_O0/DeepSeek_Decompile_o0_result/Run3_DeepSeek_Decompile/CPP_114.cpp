Okay, so I've got this LLVM IR code that I need to decompile into C++ source code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. The module is called 'CPP_114.cpp', which suggests it's a C++ file. The target triple is x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, so it's compiled for a 64-bit Linux system.

Looking at the function definitions, there's a function called @_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE, which I think is the main function I need to focus on. The name seems mangled, so I'll try to demangle it. Using a C++ name demangler, I find that it translates to 'minSubArraySum(std::vector<long long, std::allocator<long long>>)'.

So, the function takes a vector of long long integers and returns a long long. The purpose seems to be finding the minimum subarray sum, which is a common problem in algorithmic coding.

Now, I'll look at the body of this function. It starts by allocating some variables: %2, %3, and %4. %2 and %3 are 64-bit integers, and %4 is a 32-bit integer. It then calls @_ZNSt6vectorIxSaIxEEixEm, which I recognize as the vector's operator[], used to access elements.

The function loads the first element of the vector into %2 and %3. Then it initializes %4 to 1, which I assume is the loop counter starting at index 1.

The loop begins at label 9. It loads the counter, converts it to a 64-bit integer, and then calls @_ZNKSt6vectorIxSaIxEE4sizeEv, which is the size() function of the vector. It compares the counter with the size; if the counter is less than the size, it continues the loop.

Inside the loop, it checks if the current minimum (%15) is less than zero. If it is, it adds the next element in the vector to the current sum. If not, it starts a new subarray from the current element. It then updates the minimum sum if the current sum is smaller than the previous minimum.

After processing all elements, it returns the minimum sum stored in %3.

Putting this together, the function initializes the current and minimum sums to the first element. Then, for each subsequent element, it decides whether to add it to the current sum or start a new subarray. It keeps track of the smallest sum encountered.

I think the original C++ code would have a loop that iterates through the vector, maintaining a running sum and updating the minimum when necessary. It's similar to Kadane's algorithm for finding the minimum subarray sum.

I should structure the C++ code accordingly, initializing variables, looping through the vector, and updating the sums as described. I'll make sure to handle cases where all numbers are positive by starting with the first element as the initial min.

Let me write the code step by step, ensuring it matches the logic in the IR. I'll start by declaring the function, initializing current and min_sum, then looping from the second element to the end, updating the sums as needed. Finally, I'll return min_sum.

I think that's the gist of it. Now, I'll write the C++ code that reflects this logic.

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum subarray sum within a given array of integers. This problem can be efficiently solved using Kadane's algorithm, which iterates through the array while maintaining a running sum of the current subarray and updating the minimum sum encountered.

### Approach
The approach involves the following steps:
1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing two variables, `current_sum` and `min_sum`, both set to the first element of the array. This handles the case where the minimum subarray might be a single negative number.
2. **Iteration**: Loop through the array starting from the second element. For each element, decide whether to add it to the current subarray or start a new subarray from the current element.
3. **Update Minimum Sum**: After each addition, check if the current sum is smaller than the minimum sum encountered so far. If it is, update the minimum sum.
4. **Completion**: After processing all elements, return the minimum sum found.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum subarray sum in linear time, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Solution Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

long long minSubArraySum(vector<long long> arr) {
    if (arr.empty()) {
        return 0; // Handle empty vector if necessary
    }

    long long current_sum = arr[0];
    long long min_sum = arr[0];

    for (size_t i = 1; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        current_sum += arr[i];
        if (current_sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = current_sum;
        }
    }

    return min_sum;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: `current_sum` and `min_sum` are both initialized to the first element of the array to handle cases where the smallest subarray is a single element.
- **Loop Through Elements**: Starting from the second element, each element is added to `current_sum`. If `current_sum` becomes smaller than `min_sum`, `min_sum` is updated.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in linear time, making it suitable for large arrays. It only requires a single pass through the array, ensuring optimal performance.

This solution is both efficient and straightforward, leveraging Kadane's algorithm to find the minimum subarray sum effectively.
