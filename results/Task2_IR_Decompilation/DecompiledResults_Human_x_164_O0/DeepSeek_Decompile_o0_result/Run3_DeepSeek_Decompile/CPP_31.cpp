Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's start by looking at the provided IR code. It's a function named _Z8is_primex, which I think is a C++ function because of the name mangling. 

The function takes an i64 argument, which is a 64-bit integer, and returns a boolean (i1). So the function signature in C++ would probably be something like bool is_prime(int64_t x).

Looking at the IR code, the function starts by allocating space for a boolean (%2), an i64 (%3), and another i64 (%4). It stores the input %0 into %3. Then it loads %5 from %3 and checks if it's less than 2 using icmp slt. If it is, it stores false into %2 and jumps to label 26. Otherwise, it proceeds.

From label 8, it initializes %4 to 2 and enters a loop. Inside the loop, it loads the current value of %4 (let's call it i) and squares it (i*i). It compares this square to the input x. If i squared is less than or equal to x, it continues; otherwise, it sets the result to true and exits.

If the square is within bounds, it checks if x is divisible by i using srem (signed remainder). If the remainder is zero, it sets the result to false. Otherwise, it increments i by 1 and loops back.

I need to translate this logic into C++. The loop runs from 2 up to sqrt(x), checking for any divisors. If any divisor is found, x is not prime; else, it is prime. Also, handle the case where x is less than 2, which isn't prime.

Wait, in the IR, after checking the remainder, it either exits with false or continues the loop. If the loop exits because i squared exceeds x, then it returns true. That makes sense for primes.

So the C++ code should have a loop starting at 2, checking divisibility up to sqrt(x). If any i divides x, return false. If loop completes without finding a divisor, return true. Also, return false if x is less than 2.

I think that's the translation. Now, I'll write the C++ function accordingly.

The function `_Z8is_primex` is a primality test that checks if a given 64-bit integer is prime. Here's the C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool is_prime(int64_t x) {
    if (x < 2) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int64_t i = 2; (i * i) <= x; ++i) {
        if (x % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    cout << boolalpha; // Print 'true' or 'false' instead of 1 or 0
    cout << is_prime(17) << endl;  // Output: true
    cout << is_prime(15) << endl;  // Output: false
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. The `main` function demonstrates its usage with example inputs.
