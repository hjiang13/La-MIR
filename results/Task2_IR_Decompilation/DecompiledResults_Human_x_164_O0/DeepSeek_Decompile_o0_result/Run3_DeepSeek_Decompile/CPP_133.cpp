Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by looking at the IR code provided. 

First, I notice that the module is related to a C++ file, specifically "CPP_133.cpp", and it's using the x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu target. The code seems to involve a function called _Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE, which, when demangled, probably translates to a function named sum_squares that takes a std::vector<float> as an argument.

Looking at the function definition, it's declared as i32, which suggests it returns an integer. It takes a pointer to a std::vector of floats. Inside the function, there's a loop that iterates over the vector elements. 

I see that there are two variables allocated: %2 and %3, both i32. %2 is initialized to 0, which might be the sum variable. %3 is the loop index starting at 0. The loop condition checks if the index is less than the size of the vector, which is obtained via a call to size(). 

Inside the loop, the code is accessing the vector elements using operator[] (via the @_ZNSt6vectorIfSaIfEEixEm function), which is the subscript operator. It's loading two consecutive elements, applying the ceil function to each, multiplying them, and adding the result to the sum. 

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me double-check. It's accessing the same index twice? Or maybe it's accessing consecutive elements. No, looking at the code, after accessing the element, it's incrementing the index, so perhaps it's accessing the same element twice, which might be a mistake. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the indices.

Wait, the code loads %3, which is the loop index, then does some operations, and then increments %3. So perhaps it's processing each element once. But then why are there two calls to vector::operator[] with the same index? Let me look again.

In the loop body, it's accessing the element at %11 (which is %3) and then again at %16 (which is %3 again). So both %14 and %18 are loading the same element. That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps it's intended to process the same element twice, but that doesn't make much sense in the context of summing squares. Alternatively, perhaps it's processing two consecutive elements each iteration, but the code doesn't seem to suggest that.

Wait, no, the loop increments %3 by 1 each time, so each iteration processes the next element. But in each iteration, it's accessing the same element twice. That doesn't seem right. Maybe it's a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is accessing each element once, applying ceil, and then squaring it, but the way it's written, it's multiplying the ceiled element by itself. So the sum of squares of the ceiled elements.

Wait, let me go through the loop step by step. The function starts with sum = 0 and index = 0. Then, in each iteration:

1. Load the current index as i.
2. Get the i-th element, apply ceil, get a float.
3. Get the same i-th element again, apply ceil again, get another float.
4. Multiply the two ceiled floats.
5. Add this product to the sum.
6. Increment the index.
7. Loop until index reaches the size of the vector.

So, each element is ceiled, then multiplied by itself (since it's the same element), thus squaring it, and added to the sum. So the function is summing the squares of the ceiled values of each element in the vector.

But wait, if it's the same element, then it's the square. So the function is sum_squares, which returns the sum of the squares of the ceiled elements.

Now, looking at the other functions, there's the size() function, which returns the size of the vector, and the ceilf function, which is the standard ceil function for floats.

Putting this all together, the C++ code would have a function that takes a vector of floats, iterates through each element, applies ceil to each, squares it, and sums all these squares.

So the function would look something like:

int sum_squares(std::vector<float> &vec) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        float val = vec[i];
        float ceiled = ceil(val);
        sum += static_cast<int>(ceiled * ceiled);
    }
    return sum;
}

Wait, but in the IR, the sum is being accumulated as a float and then converted to int. So each addition is done in floating-point, then stored as an int. But that's slightly different from what I wrote, where each term is an int. But the result is the same because the product of two ceiled floats is a float, which is then added to the sum as a float, and finally returned as an int.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is summing the product of two consecutive elements after applying ceil. But no, the index isn't incrementing within the loop body, so it's using the same index twice. So it's definitely squaring the same element.

So, the C++ code should reflect that.
</think>

The provided LLVM IR code corresponds to a C++ function named `sum_squares` that calculates the sum of the squares of the ceiling values of each element in a vector of floats. Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int sum_squares(vector<float> &vec) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        float val = vec[i];
        float ceiled = ceilf(val);
        sum += static_cast<int>(ceiled * ceiled);
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This function initializes a sum variable to 0, iterates over each element in the vector, applies the `ceil` function to each element, squares the result, and accumulates the sum. The final sum is returned as an integer.
