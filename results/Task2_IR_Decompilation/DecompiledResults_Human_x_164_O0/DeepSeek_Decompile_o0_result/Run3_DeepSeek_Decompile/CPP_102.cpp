Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by looking at the IR code provided.

First, I notice that the function is named @_Z10choose_numii, which is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find that it translates to "choose_num(int, int)". So, the function takes two integers and returns an integer.

Looking at the function definition, it's decorated with attributes like mustprogress, noinline, nounwind, and uwtable. These suggest that the function shouldn't be inlined, it's not unwindable, and it uses a UW table for exception handling, though I don't see any exceptions in the code.

The function starts by allocating space for three integers: %3, %4, and %5. It then stores the two input parameters %0 and %1 into %4 and %5 respectively. So, %4 holds the first argument, and %5 holds the second.

Next, it loads these values back into %6 and %7 and performs an icmp slt (signed less than) comparison. If %6 (which is the second argument) is less than %7 (the first argument), it branches to label 9; otherwise, it goes to label 10.

In label 9, it stores -1 into %3 and then jumps to label 28. So, if the second argument is less than the first, the function returns -1.

Moving to label 10, it again loads the two arguments and checks if they're equal. If they are, it goes to label 14; otherwise, it goes to label 19.

In label 14, it loads the second argument again, computes the remainder when divided by 2 (srem), and checks if it's equal to 1. If so, it stores -1 in %3 and goes to label 28. Otherwise, it proceeds to label 19.

At label 19, it again takes the second argument, checks if it's odd (remainder 1), and if so, subtracts 1 and stores the result in %3, then jumps to 28. If it's even, it just stores the second argument in %3 and goes to 28.

Finally, at label 28, it loads the value from %3 and returns it.

Putting this all together, the function seems to be making decisions based on the two input integers. If the second is less than the first, return -1. If they're equal, check if the second is odd. If so, return -1; else, return the second argument. If they're not equal, check if the second is odd. If yes, subtract 1; else, return as is.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me re-express it step by step.

The function starts by checking if the second number is less than the first. If yes, return -1.

If not, check if both numbers are equal. If they are equal, then check if the second number is odd. If it is, return -1; else, return the second number.

If the numbers aren't equal, then check if the second number is odd. If it is, subtract 1; else, return it as is.

Wait, that doesn't seem to cover all cases correctly. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the control flow.

Let me outline the control flow:

1. If (b < a) → return -1
2. Else if (a == b):
   a. If (b is odd) → return -1
   b. Else → return b
3. Else (a != b and b >= a):
   a. If (b is odd) → return b-1
   b. Else → return b

Wait, but the else in the first if (b >= a) includes both a == b and a < b. So, maybe the logic is:

If b < a → return -1

Else, if a == b:

   if b is odd → return -1

   else → return b

Else (a < b):

   if b is odd → return b-1

   else → return b

So, the function returns -1 in two cases: when b < a, or when a == b and b is odd. Otherwise, it returns b, except when a < b and b is odd, in which case it returns b-1.

Wait, that might make sense. Let me try to write this logic in C++.

So, the function would look like:

int choose_num(int a, int b) {

    if (b < a) {

        return -1;

    } else if (a == b) {

        if (b % 2 == 1) {

            return -1;

        } else {

            return b;

        }

    } else { // a < b

        if (b % 2 == 1) {

            return b - 1;

        } else {

            return b;

        }

    }

}

I think that's the correct translation. Let me double-check each condition:

- If b is less than a: return -1. (Covered)
- If a equals b: check if b is odd. If yes, return -1; else, return b. (Covered)
- If a is less than b: check if b is odd. If yes, return b-1; else, return b. (Covered)

Yes, that seems to match the IR code's behavior.

The decompiled C++ code for the given LLVM IR is as follows:

```cpp
int choose_num(int a, int b) {
    if (b < a) {
        return -1;
    } else if (a == b) {
        if (b % 2 == 1) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            return b;
        }
    } else {
        if (b % 2 == 1) {
            return b - 1;
        } else {
            return b;
        }
    }
}
```

This function returns -1 if `b` is less than `a` or if `a` equals `b` and `b` is odd. When `a` is less than `b`, it returns `b-1` if `b` is odd, otherwise `b`.
