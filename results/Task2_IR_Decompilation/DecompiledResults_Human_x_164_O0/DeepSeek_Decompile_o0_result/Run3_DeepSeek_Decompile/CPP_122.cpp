Okay, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the IR, I see a function named `_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi`, which I think is the mangled name for a function called `add_elements` that takes a `std::vector<int>` and an integer. The function returns an integer.

Inside `add_elements`, there are variables allocated on the stack: `%3`, `%4`, and `%5`. They seem to hold the loop limit (`%1`), a sum accumulator, and a loop counter, respectively.

The loop starts at label `6`. It loads the loop counter and the limit, checks if the counter is less than the limit, and branches accordingly. 

In the loop body, it calls `operator[]` on the vector three times, each time with an index based on the loop counter. It checks if the elements are within certain bounds (-99 to 99). If both checks pass, it adds the element's value to the sum.

After the loop, it returns the accumulated sum stored in `%4`.

The helper function `@_ZNSt6vectorIiSaIiEEixEm` is the `operator[]` for the vector, which returns a pointer to the element at the given index.

Putting this together, the function loops through the first `n` elements of the vector, checks each element, and sums those within the specified range.

Now, translating this into C++. The function will take a vector and an integer `n`. It initializes `sum` to 0 and loops from 0 to `n-1`. For each index, it retrieves the element, checks if it's between -99 and 99, and adds it to `sum` if so. Finally, it returns the sum.

I need to make sure the bounds checking is correct and that the loop doesn't access out-of-bounds elements. Also, the function should handle cases where `n` is larger than the vector size, but in this code, it seems `n` is controlled by the caller, so I'll assume it's within bounds.

The sum is initialized to 0, and each valid element is added. The function returns this sum after the loop completes.

So, the C++ code should look something like this:

int add_elements(std::vector<int> vec, int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (vec[i] >= -99 && vec[i] <= 99) {
            sum += vec[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

I think this should correctly replicate the behavior of the provided IR code.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Function Signature**:
   - The function `@_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi` is the mangled name for a function named `add_elements` that takes a `std::vector<int>` and an `int` as arguments and returns an `int`.

2. **Analyze the IR Code**:
   - The function initializes three variables on the stack: the loop limit (`%3`), the sum accumulator (`%4`), and the loop counter (`%5`).
   - It enters a loop where it checks each element of the vector up to the given limit.
   - For each element, it checks if the value is within the range `[-99, 99]`. If both conditions are satisfied, it adds the value to the sum.
   - After processing all elements, it returns the accumulated sum.

3. **Translate to C++**:
   - Declare the function `add_elements` with the appropriate parameters.
   - Initialize the sum to 0.
   - Loop through the first `n` elements of the vector.
   - For each element, check if it falls within the specified range and accumulate the sum.
   - Return the total sum after the loop completes.

Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int add_elements(vector<int> vec, int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (vec[i] >= -99 && vec[i] <= 99) {
            sum += vec[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This C++ code accurately reflects the behavior described by the provided LLVM IR code. It initializes a sum variable, iterates through the specified number of elements in the vector, checks each element against the given range, and accumulates the sum accordingly before returning it.
