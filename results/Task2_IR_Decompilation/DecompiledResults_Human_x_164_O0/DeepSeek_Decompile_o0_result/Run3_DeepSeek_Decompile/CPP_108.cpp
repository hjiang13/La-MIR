Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's start by understanding what the IR code represents. The main function seems to be `@_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which I recognize as a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, this translates to `count_nums(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int>>)`.

Looking at the function, it initializes some variables and then enters a loop. The loop runs from 0 up to the size of the vector, which is obtained via the `size()` method. For each element, it checks if the value is greater than 0. If so, it increments a counter.

If the value is not greater than 0, it proceeds to calculate the absolute value of the element. It then sums the digits of this absolute value. To do this, it repeatedly extracts the last digit using modulo 10, adds it to a sum, and then removes the last digit using integer division by 10. This continues until all digits are processed.

After summing the digits, if the sum is positive, it increments the same counter as before. Finally, after processing all elements, the function returns the counter value.

I also notice that there are helper functions for `size()` and `operator[]` of the vector, which are part of the standard library implementation. Another function is `abs()`, which is used to get the absolute value of a number.

Putting this all together, the function `count_nums` takes a vector of integers and counts how many of them are positive or have digits that sum to a positive number. 

I'll structure the C++ code to reflect this logic. The main function will loop through each element, perform the checks and calculations, and return the count. I'll make sure to handle the absolute value and digit sum correctly, as well as use proper variable names for clarity.

I should also include any necessary headers, like `<vector>` and `<cstdlib>` for `abs()`. Since the function is self-contained, I don't need any additional includes beyond what's necessary for the vector and absolute value functions.

Finally, I'll test the code with some sample inputs to ensure it behaves as expected. For example, a vector with positive numbers should count them, and numbers with positive digit sums should also be counted. This will help verify that the decompilation is correct.

Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I can help decompile it into C++ source code. The code appears to be a function that counts numbers in a vector based on certain conditions. Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib> // for abs()

using namespace std;

int count_nums(vector<int> vec) {
    int count = 0;
    int index = 0;
    int temp = 0;
    int digit_sum = 0;

    while (index < vec.size()) {
        if (vec[index] > 0) {
            count++;
            index++;
            continue;
        }

        temp = abs(vec[index]);
        digit_sum = 0;

        while (temp >= 10) {
            digit_sum += temp % 10;
            temp /= 10;
        }

        if (digit_sum > 0) {
            count++;
        }

        index++;
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `count_nums` takes a `std::vector<int>` as input and returns an `int`.
2. It initializes several variables:
   - `count` to keep track of numbers meeting the condition
   - `index` to iterate through the vector
   - `temp` to store temporary values for processing
   - `digit_sum` to accumulate the sum of digits

3. The main loop iterates through each element of the vector:
   - If the current element is greater than 0, it increments the `count` and moves to the next element.
   - If the current element is not greater than 0, it calculates the absolute value of the element and then sums its digits.
   - If the sum of the digits is greater than 0, it increments the `count`.

4. The function returns the total count after processing all elements in the vector.

This code should be equivalent to the provided LLVM IR code. It can be compiled and run directly as a C++ program.
