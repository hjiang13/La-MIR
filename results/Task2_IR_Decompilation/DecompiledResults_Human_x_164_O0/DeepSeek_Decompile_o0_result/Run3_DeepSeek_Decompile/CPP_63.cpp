Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided some LLVM IR code and wants me to decompile it back into C++ source code that can be run directly. 

First, I need to understand what the IR code is doing. I'll start by looking through the provided code. It defines a function named `_Z6fibfibi`, which seems to be a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I can figure out that this function is likely `fibfib_`. 

Looking at the function, I notice it has a loop structure. There's a variable `n` stored in `%2`, and an array `a` of 100 integers initialized in `%3`. There's also an index variable `i` stored in `%4` which starts at 3. 

The loop condition checks if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Inside the loop, it's accessing elements of the array `a` using indices based on `i-1`, `i-2`, and `i-3`. It computes a value by adding `a[i-1]`, `a[i-2]`, and `a[i-3]`, then stores the result back into `a[i]`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Once the loop exits, it returns the value of `a[n]`.

Putting this together, it looks like the function is computing a tribonacci sequence, similar to the Fibonacci sequence but summing the previous three terms instead of two. The array `a` is being used to store these values iteratively.

Now, to write the C++ code. I'll start by declaring the array `a` and initializing it with the first three values. Then, I'll set up a loop starting from index 3 up to `n`, computing each subsequent value as the sum of the previous three. Finally, I'll return `a[n]`.

I need to make sure the function is correctly defined with the right name and that the array is properly initialized and accessed. Also, I'll include the necessary includes and ensure the code is compilable.

In the end, I should provide the complete C++ code, explaining each part so the user can understand how it works and run it themselves.

I'll help you decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. The IR code appears to implement a function that calculates something similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with three preceding terms (tribonacci). Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fibfib(int n) {
    int a[100] = {0};  // Initialize array with zeros
    a[0] = 0;
    a[1] = 0;
    a[2] = 1;
    int i = 3;

    while (i <= n) {
        a[i] = a[i-1] + a[i-2] + a[i-3];
        i++;
    }

    return a[n];
}

int main() {
    int result = fibfib(10);  // Example usage
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Decompilation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `_Z6fibfibi` is the mangled name for `fibfib`, and it takes an integer `n` as input.

2. **Array Initialization**: The function initializes an array `a` of size 100 with zeros. The first three elements are explicitly set to 0, 0, and 1, respectively.

3. **Loop Structure**: The loop starts at index 3 and continues up to `n`. For each index `i`, it calculates the value as the sum of the previous three elements in the array.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the value at index `n` in the array.

5. **Main Function**: I added a `main` function to demonstrate how to use `fibfib` and print the result.

### Notes:
- The array size of 100 means this implementation works for values of `n` up to 99.
- The function uses dynamic programming to store intermediate results, making it more efficient than a purely recursive approach.

You can compile and run this code directly using any C++ compiler, such as `g++`.
