Alright, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code is doing.

Looking at the function `_Z9fizz_buzzi(i32 %0)`, I notice it's a function that takes an integer and returns another integer. The IR uses several local variables stored on the stack, which suggests that the original function uses multiple variables to track its state.

First, the function allocates four 32-bit integers on the stack: %2, %3, %4, and %5. It then stores the input into %2, and initializes %3 and %4 to 0. The loop starts at label 6, where it loads the value from %4 into %7 and the input from %2 into %8. It checks if %7 is less than %8, which determines whether to continue looping or exit.

Inside the loop, it checks if the current value of %4 is divisible by 11. If it is, it proceeds to check if it's also divisible by 13. If either condition is true, it stores the current value into %5 and enters another loop that checks each digit of %5. If a digit is 7, it increments a counter in %3. It then removes the last digit from %5 and continues until all digits are checked.

After processing, if the number isn't a multiple of 11 or 13, the loop increments the current value and continues. Once the loop exits, the function returns the counter value stored in %3.

Putting this together, the original function seems to count how many numbers up to a given input have at least one '7' in their digits and are multiples of 11 or 13. I'll translate this logic into C++, using a loop structure, conditional checks, and digit extraction to match the IR's behavior.

To convert the provided LLVM IR code back into C++ source code, we can analyze the IR and map it to corresponding C++ constructs. The IR appears to implement a function that counts numbers with specific properties up to a given input. Here's the reconstructed C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fizz_buzz(int n) {
    int counter = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0) {
            int num = i;
            while (num > 0) {
                if (num % 10 == 7) {
                    counter++;
                    break;
                }
                num /= 10;
            }
        }
    }
    return counter;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter a number: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << "Result: " << fizz_buzz(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function `fizz_buzz`**:
   - Takes an integer `n` and initializes a `counter` to 0.
   - Iterates through each number from 0 to `n`.
   - For each number, checks if it's divisible by 11 or 13.
   - If divisible, checks each digit for the presence of '7', incrementing the counter if found.
   - Returns the total count of such numbers.

2. **Main Function**:
   - Reads an integer input from the user.
   - Calls `fizz_buzz` with the input and prints the result.

You can compile and run this code to test its functionality.
