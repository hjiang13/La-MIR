Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++. I remember that IR is a low-level representation, so I'll need to map the instructions back to high-level constructs.

Looking at the function _Z3fibi, I see it takes an i32 parameter. The function starts by allocating memory: %2 is an i32, %3 is an array of 1000 i32s, and %4 is another i32. So, in C++, this might translate to declaring variables, perhaps something like int n = %0; int fib[1000]; int k = 2;.

Next, there's a store instruction for %0 into %2, so that's initializing n. Then, the array is initialized with 0 and 1, which suggests fib[0] = 0 and fib[1] = 1. The variable k is stored as 2, so k starts at 2.

There's a loop starting at label 7. The loop condition compares k with n. If k is less than or equal to n, it proceeds; else, it exits the loop. Inside the loop, it's calculating fib[k] as fib[k-1] + fib[k-2], which is the Fibonacci sequence.

After the loop, it loads fib[n] and returns it. So the function is returning the nth Fibonacci number.

Putting it all together, the C++ function should initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers, loop from 2 up to n, compute each Fibonacci number, and return the nth one. I should make sure the array is properly sized and handle cases where n is 0 or 1 to avoid accessing invalid indices.

I think that's the gist of it. Now, I'll write the C++ code based on this understanding.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we need to analyze the instructions and map them back to their high-level C++ equivalents. The IR code appears to implement a function that calculates Fibonacci numbers using an array for storage.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fibi(int n) {
    int* fib = new int[1000]; // Allocate memory for the Fibonacci sequence
    fib[0] = 0;
    fib[1] = 1;
    int k = 2;

    while (k <= n) {
        fib[k] = fib[k-1] + fib[k-2];
        k++;
    }

    int result = fib[n];
    delete[] fib; // Deallocate the memory
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example input
    cout << "Fibonacci number at position " << n << " is: " << fibi(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Memory Allocation**: The IR code allocates an array of 1000 integers, which is replicated using `new int[1000]` in C++. This array stores the Fibonacci sequence up to the 1000th element.

- **Initialization**: The first two elements of the array are initialized to 0 and 1, corresponding to the base cases of the Fibonacci sequence.

- **Loop Construction**: The loop runs from `k = 2` up to `n`, calculating each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding numbers. This is implemented using a `while` loop in C++.

- **Result Extraction**: After the loop completes, the function retrieves the nth Fibonacci number from the array and returns it.

- **Memory Deallocation**: The dynamically allocated memory is deallocated using `delete[]` to prevent memory leaks.

- **Example Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates how to use `fibi` by calculating the 10th Fibonacci number and printing the result.

This code should compile and run correctly, producing the expected output for the Fibonacci sequence.
