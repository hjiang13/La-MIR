Okay, so I have this LLVM IR code that I need to decompile back into C++ source code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me start by reading through the IR code carefully to understand what it's doing.

First, I see that the function is named @_Z4fib4i, which looks like a mangled C++ name. If I demangle that, it probably becomes something like "fib" taking an integer and returning an integer. So, the function signature is likely int fib(int).

Looking at the IR, the function starts by allocating some memory. There's an alloca for an i32, which is probably the variable n. Then there's an alloca for a [100 x i32], which suggests an array of 100 integers. Another alloca for an i32, maybe a counter or index variable.

Next, the function stores the input parameter %0 into %2, which is the address of the first alloca. So %2 holds the value of n. Then it initializes some elements of the array. The first element is set to 0, the second to 0, the third to 2, and the fourth to 0. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me check the indices: 0, 1, 2, 3. So the array starts with 0, 0, 2, 0.

Then there's a store of 4 into %4, which is the third alloca. So %4 is initialized to 4. The function then enters a loop labeled 9. Inside the loop, it loads the value from %4 into %10 and the value from %2 into %11. It compares whether %10 is less than or equal to %11. If true, it branches to label 13; otherwise, it exits the loop to label 43.

In label 13, it seems to be calculating some values using the array. It subtracts 1 from %14 (which is %4) and uses that as an index to load from the array. Then it subtracts 2 and does the same, adds those two values, subtracts 3, loads that value, adds again, subtracts 4, loads, adds all together, and stores the result back into the array at the current index. Then it increments %4 by 1 and loops back.

Once the loop exits at label 43, it loads the value from %2 (n) and uses it as an index to load from the array, then returns that value.

Putting this together, it looks like the function is precomputing Fibonacci numbers up to n using an array, probably to avoid recomputation. The initial values suggest that fib(0)=0, fib(1)=0, fib(2)=2, and fib(3)=0. That's a bit confusing because the standard Fibonacci sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, 2, etc. Maybe this is a modified version.

Wait, looking again, maybe the array is being used to store the sequence, but the initial values might be placeholders or part of a different setup. The loop starts at 4 and goes up to n, so perhaps it's a dynamic programming approach where each fib(i) is the sum of the previous four terms or something similar. But in the code, it's adding the previous three terms: i-1, i-2, and i-3. Hmm, that would make it a Tribonacci-like sequence, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's just a way to compute the Fibonacci numbers iteratively with memoization. But the initial values don't quite fit the standard Fibonacci. Maybe the function is designed differently.

In any case, the function seems to compute the nth value using an array to store intermediate results, which is efficient for multiple calls but might be overkill for a single call. But for the purpose of decompiling, I need to translate this logic into C++.

So, the C++ function will have a local array of 100 integers. It will initialize the first few elements and then loop from 4 up to n, computing each value as the sum of the previous three, or maybe the previous one, two, and three steps back. Looking at the IR, each iteration computes the current value as the sum of the three preceding values.

Wait, in the IR, it's adding %18 (i-1), %23 (i-2), and %29 (i-3), and then %35 (i-4). Wait, no, let me check:

In the IR, after subtracting 1, 2, 3, and 4 from %14, which is the loop variable. So for each i (starting from 4), it's adding fib(i-1) + fib(i-2) + fib(i-3) + fib(i-4)? Or is it adding three terms?

Looking at the code:

%18 is i-1, %23 is i-2, %29 is i-3, and %35 is i-4. Then %36 is the sum of %30 (which is %24 + %29) and %35. Wait, %24 is %18 + %23, then %30 is %24 + %29, and %36 is %30 + %35. So it's adding four terms: i-1, i-2, i-3, and i-4.

So the function is computing fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2) + fib(i-3) + fib(i-4). That's a different recurrence relation than the standard Fibonacci.

But the initial conditions are fib(0)=0, fib(1)=0, fib(2)=2, fib(3)=0. That seems a bit strange. Maybe it's a specific problem's requirement.

So, in the C++ code, I'll need to declare an array of 100 integers, initialize the first four elements as 0, 0, 2, 0, and then loop from 4 to n, each time computing the current value as the sum of the previous four elements.

Wait, but in the IR, the loop starts at 4 and goes up to n. So for i from 4 to n, compute fib_i as sum of fib_i-1, fib_i-2, fib_i-3, fib_i-4.

But when I look at the initial stores, the first element is 0, second 0, third 2, fourth 0. So index 0 is 0, index 1 is 0, index 2 is 2, index 3 is 0.

So the array is 0, 0, 2, 0, and then each new term is the sum of the previous four.

But wait, when i=4, the sum would be 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 2. So fib(4) = 2. Then i=5: 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4. i=6: 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 8, and so on.

But in the IR, after computing %36, which is the sum, it's stored at index %37, which is the current value of %4. So the loop variable is %4, starting at 4 and incrementing by 1 each iteration.

So the C++ code would have something like:

int fib(int n) {
    int arr[100];
    arr[0] = 0;
    arr[1] = 0;
    arr[2] = 2;
    arr[3] = 0;
    int i = 4;
    while (i <= n) {
        arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2] + arr[i-3] + arr[i-4];
        i++;
    }
    return arr[n];
}

Wait, but in the IR, the loop starts with i=4 and goes up to n, which is passed as an argument. So the function initializes the array, loops from 4 to n, computes each term, and then returns arr[n].

But when n is less than 4, like n=0,1,2,3, the loop doesn't run, and it just returns arr[n] as per the initial values.

So that's the logic. Now, I need to make sure the C++ code handles all cases correctly, including when n is greater than or equal to 4.

I should also note that the array is declared as [100 x i32], so the maximum index is 99. Therefore, the function can handle n up to 99. If n is larger than that, it might cause an out-of-bounds access, but that's beyond the current scope.

In the C++ code, the array is declared inside the function, so it's a local variable. Each call to fib will have its own array, which is probably not the most efficient, but that's how the IR is set up.

So, putting it all together, the C++ code would look like this:

int fib(int n) {
    int arr[100];
    arr[0] = 0;
    arr[1] = 0;
    arr[2] = 2;
    arr[3] = 0;
    for (int i = 4; i <= n; ++i) {
        arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2] + arr[i-3] + arr[i-4];
    }
    return arr[n];
}

Wait, but in the IR, the initial values are set as 0, 0, 2, 0. So the function returns arr[n], which for n=0 is 0, n=1 is 0, n=2 is 2, n=3 is 0, and n>=4 is computed.

I should test this with some values. For example, when n=4, it should be 0+0+2+0=2. n=5: 0+2+0+2=4. n=6: 2+0+2+4=8, etc.

Yes, that seems to align with the IR's logic.

I think this should be the correct decompilation. I'll write the final code accordingly.

To decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we analyze the functionality step by step. The IR code implements a function that computes a sequence using an array to store intermediate values, similar to a dynamic programming approach. The function initializes the array with specific values and iteratively computes each subsequent value based on the sum of the previous four elements. Here's the resulting C++ code:

```cpp
int fib(int n) {
    int arr[100];
    arr[0] = 0;
    arr[1] = 0;
    arr[2] = 2;
    arr[3] = 0;
    for (int i = 4; i <= n; ++i) {
        arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2] + arr[i-3] + arr[i-4];
    }
    return arr[n];
}
```

This C++ function initializes an array of 100 integers with specific starting values and computes each subsequent value up to `n` using the sum of the previous four elements. The function returns the nth value from the array, effectively computing a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2) + fib(i-3) + fib(i-4)` with the given initial conditions.
