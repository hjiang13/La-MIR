Alright, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's see, I remember that LLVM IR is a low-level representation, so it should correspond closely to the original C++ code, but without the higher-level abstractions.

Looking at the first function, it's named @_Z9solutionsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. The mangling here suggests it's a function called 'solutions' that takes a std::vector<int> as an argument. The function returns an i32, which is a 32-bit integer.

Inside the function, there are a few local variables allocated: %2 and %3, both i32. They're initialized to 0. Then there's a loop starting at label 4. In the loop, it's loading the value from %3, multiplying by 2, converting to i64, and comparing it to the size of the vector.

The size is obtained by calling @_ZNKSt6vectorIiSaIiEE4sizeEv, which is the size() member function of the vector. So, the loop is iterating while 2*%3 is less than the size of the vector.

Inside the loop, it's accessing the vector elements using the [] operator, which in IR is represented by the @_ZNSt6vectorIiSaIiEEixEm function. For each element, it's checking if the element modulo 2 is 1, which means it's odd. If it is, it's adding that element to the sum stored in %2.

The loop increments %3 each time and continues until it's processed all elements. Finally, it returns the sum in %2.

Putting this together, the function 'solutions' is summing all the odd numbers in the vector. So the C++ code would create a vector of integers, loop through each element, check if it's odd, and add it to a running total, which is then returned.

I think that's the gist of it. Now, I'll write the C++ code that matches this logic.

The provided LLVM IR code implements a function that sums the odd numbers in a vector of integers. Here's the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int solutions(vector<int> &vec) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        if (vec[i] % 2 == 1) {
            sum += vec[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This C++ function `solutions` takes a reference to a `vector<int>` and returns the sum of all odd elements in the vector. The function iterates through each element, checks if it's odd, and accumulates the sum accordingly.
