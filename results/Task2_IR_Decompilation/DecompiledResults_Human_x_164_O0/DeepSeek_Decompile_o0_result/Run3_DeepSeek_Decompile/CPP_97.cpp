Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let's go through it step by step.

First, looking at the module information: the source filename is "CPP_97.cpp", so the original file was a C++ file. The function defined is @_Z8multiplyii, which I know from C++ name mangling stands for a function named "multiply" that takes two integers and returns an integer.

Now, examining the function body. The function starts by allocating space for two integers on the stack, %3 and %4, each aligned to 4 bytes. It then stores the two input parameters %0 and %1 into these locations. So, %3 and %4 are pointers to the stored values of the first and second arguments, respectively.

Next, it loads these stored values back into registers %5 and %8. Then, it calls the @abs function on each, resulting in %6 and %9. The @abs is the standard absolute value function, so this makes sense.

After that, it computes the remainder when each absolute value is divided by 10 using srem. So, %7 is the last digit of the first number, and %10 is the last digit of the second number.

Then, it multiplies these two digits together using mul nsw, which is a multiplication without overflow checking, and returns the result.

Putting this together, the function takes two integers, computes the absolute value of each, takes the last digit (using modulo 10), multiplies those two digits, and returns that product.

So, the C++ function would look like this: take two ints, compute their absolute values, get the last digit of each, multiply them, and return the result.

I should make sure to include the absolute value function, but since C++ has std::abs in <cstdlib>, I'll need to include that header. Also, I'll name the function multiply to match the mangled name.

I think that's all. Let me write that out in C++ code.

The provided LLVM IR code can be decompiled into the following C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // For std::abs

int multiply(int a, int b) {
    int digit_a = std::abs(a) % 10;
    int digit_b = std::abs(b) % 10;
    return digit_a * digit_b;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `multiply` takes two integers as parameters.
- It calculates the absolute value of each integer using `std::abs`.
- It extracts the last digit of each number using the modulo operator `% 10`.
- It returns the product of these two last digits.

This code should be saved with a `.cpp` extension and can be compiled and run directly.
