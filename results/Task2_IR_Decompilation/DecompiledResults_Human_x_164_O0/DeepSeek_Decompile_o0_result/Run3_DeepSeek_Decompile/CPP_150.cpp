Alright, so I have this LLVM IR code that I need to decompile back into C++ source code. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. 

First, I'll look at the function definition. It's called `_Z6x_or_yiii`, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, I find that it translates to `x_or_y(int, int, int)`. So the function takes three integers and returns an integer.

Next, I see several variables being allocated on the stack: `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, and `%9`. These are probably used to store the input parameters and some intermediate values. The parameters `%0`, `%1`, `%2` are stored into `%5`, `%6`, `%7` respectively. There's also an `%8` which is an 8-bit integer initialized to 1. `%9` is a 32-bit integer, initially set to 2.

Looking at the control flow, the function starts by checking if `%10` (loaded from `%5`, which is the first parameter) is less than 2. If true, it sets `%8` to 0 and jumps to label 13. Otherwise, it proceeds to label 13. So this is an if condition checking if the first argument is less than 2.

Then, in label 13, it sets `%9` to 2 and enters a loop starting at label 14. Inside the loop, it multiplies the value in `%9` by itself and compares it with the first parameter. If the product is less than or equal to the first parameter, it proceeds to check if the first parameter is divisible by `%9`. If divisible, it sets `%8` to 0. Then, it increments `%9` by 1 and loops back.

This loop seems to be finding a factor of the first parameter. If a factor is found, `%8` is set to 0. The loop continues until the square of `%9` exceeds the first parameter.

After exiting the loop, it checks the value of `%8`. If it's 1, meaning no factor was found, it returns the second parameter. Otherwise, it returns the third parameter.

Putting this together, the function checks if the first parameter is a prime number by testing divisibility up to its square root. If it's prime (`%8` remains 1), it returns the second parameter. Otherwise, it returns the third parameter.

I think the C++ code would look something like this: a function `x_or_y` that checks if `a` is prime, then returns `x` if it is, otherwise `y`. So the code would have an if condition, a loop for checking factors, and return statements accordingly.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the structure and operations step by step.

### Decompilation Steps:
1. **Function Signature**: The function `_Z6x_or_yiii` is mangled. Demangling gives `x_or_y(int, int, int)`, indicating a function that takes three integers and returns an integer.

2. **Variable Allocation**: The function allocates several variables on the stack, including the input parameters and intermediate values. The key variables are:
   - `%5`, `%6`, `%7` for the input parameters.
   - `%8` as a flag initialized to 1.
   - `%9` initialized to 2, used as a loop counter.

3. **Control Flow**:
   - An initial check if the first parameter is less than 2, setting `%8` to 0 if true.
   - A loop starting at label 14 that iterates from 2 upwards.
   - Inside the loop, the function checks if the square of `%9` is less than or equal to the first parameter.
   - It checks divisibility of the first parameter by `%9`. If divisible, `%8` is set to 0.
   - `%9` is incremented each iteration until the loop exits when the square exceeds the first parameter.

4. **Return Value**: After the loop, `%8` is checked. If it remains 1, the function returns the second parameter (indicating the first is prime). Otherwise, it returns the third parameter.

### C++ Source Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int x_or_y(int a, int x, int y) {
    bool is_prime = true;
    if (a < 2) {
        is_prime = false;
    } else {
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= a; ++i) {
            if (a % i == 0) {
                is_prime = false;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return is_prime ? x : y;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    std::cout << x_or_y(7, 10, 20) << std::endl;  // Should output 10
    std::cout << x_or_y(8, 10, 20) << std::endl;  // Should output 20
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Purpose**: The function `x_or_y` determines if the first argument `a` is a prime number. If `a` is prime, it returns `x`; otherwise, it returns `y`.
- **Prime Check**: The function uses a simple trial division method up to the square root of `a` for efficiency.
- **Example Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates how to use `x_or_y` with example values.

This decompilation accurately reflects the logic and operations present in the original LLVM IR code.
