Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing step by step.

First, I'll look at the function definition. The function is named @_Z6fibfibi, which I think is a mangled C++ name. Using a demangler, that would translate to "fib(int)" or something similar. So, this function probably calculates the Fibonacci number for a given input.

Looking at the IR code, the function starts by allocating memory for an integer and an array of 100 integers. It initializes the first few elements of the arrayâ€”indices 0, 1, and 2 are set to 0, 0, and 1 respectively. Then it stores the value 3 into another integer variable.

The code then enters a loop. It compares the current value of the integer variable (starting at 3) with the input value. If the current value is less than or equal to the input, it proceeds; otherwise, it exits the loop.

Inside the loop, it calculates the Fibonacci number by adding the two preceding elements in the array. It then increments the current value and continues the loop. Once the loop exits, it loads the Fibonacci number corresponding to the input and returns it.

I notice that the array is preinitialized with the first three Fibonacci numbers, and the loop starts from index 3. Each iteration computes the next number by summing the previous two and stores it in the array. This is a typical iterative approach to computing Fibonacci numbers, which is more efficient than a recursive method, especially for larger values.

The loop uses a variable to track the current index, starting at 3 and incrementing each time. The loop continues until this variable exceeds the input value. Once done, the function retrieves the Fibonacci number at the input index and returns it.

Putting this all together, the C++ function will take an integer as input, use an array to store Fibonacci numbers iteratively, and return the nth Fibonacci number. I'll structure the code to reflect these steps, including the array initialization, loop, and return statement.

The provided LLVM IR code appears to implement a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach with an array to store intermediate values. Here's the decompiled C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    int* arr = new int[100];
    arr[0] = 0;
    arr[1] = 0;
    arr[2] = 1;
    
    int i = 3;
    while (i <= n) {
        arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2];
        i++;
    }
    
    int result = arr[n];
    delete[] arr;
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the index for Fibonacci number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Fibonacci number at index " << n << " is: " << fib(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `fib` takes an integer `n` and initializes an array to store Fibonacci numbers up to index `n`.
- It starts with base cases: `arr[0] = 0`, `arr[1] = 0`, and `arr[2] = 1`.
- Using a while loop, it iterates from 3 to `n`, calculating each Fibonacci number as the sum of the two preceding numbers.
- After computing up to `arr[n]`, it returns this value and deallocates the array memory.
- The `main` function prompts the user for input and displays the result.

**Note:** The original IR code uses fixed-size arrays and iterative computation, which this C++ code accurately reflects.
