Alright, let's try to figure out how to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. I'm not very experienced with this, but I'll give it a shot.

First, I'll look at the IR code provided. It starts with some module info and function definitions. The main function here is `_Z7any_intfff`, which I think is a mangled C++ name. I remember that in C++, function names are mangled to include type information, so maybe I can demangle this to understand it better.

Using a demangler, I find that `_Z7any_intfff` translates to `bool any_intf(float, float, float)`. So the function takes three floats and returns a boolean.

Looking inside the function, there are several alloca instructions which suggest that the function is storing the input floats on the stack. Then it loads each float, calls `roundf` on them, and compares the result with the original value using `fcmp une`. This means it's checking if the rounded value is not equal to the original, which would indicate that the float was not an integer.

So, the function seems to be checking if any of the three floats are not integers. If any of them aren't, it returns false. If all are integers, it checks if the sum of any two equals the third. If so, it returns true; otherwise, false.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine the code.

After the initial checks, if all three floats are integers, the function proceeds to check if a + b == c, a + c == b, or b + c == a. If any of these are true, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

So, the function returns true if all three floats are integers and they satisfy the triangle inequality (i.e., the sum of any two equals the third). Otherwise, it returns false.

Now, to write the C++ code. The function will take three floats and do the following:

1. Check if any of the floats are not integers by comparing the rounded value with the original. If any fail, return false.
2. If all are integers, check if a + b == c, a + c == b, or b + c == a. If any are true, return true; else, return false.

I need to implement this logic. I'll use `std::round` to round the floats and check for equality. Then, I'll perform the sum checks.

Wait, in C++, comparing floating points for equality can be tricky due to precision issues, but since we're dealing with rounded values that should be integers, it should be safe.

So, the code would look something like:

bool any_intf(float a, float b, float c) {
    if (std::round(a) != a || std::round(b) != b || std::round(c) != c) {
        return false;
    }
    return (a + b == c) || (a + c == b) || (b + c == a);
}

But I should make sure that the parameters are named correctly and that the function is properly declared. Also, including the necessary headers like <cmath> for std::round.

I think that's the correct approach. Let me put it all together in a complete C++ file.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we first analyze the function's behavior and then translate it into equivalent C++.

The function `any_intf` checks if any of the three floats are not integers by comparing them to their rounded values. If all are integers, it then checks if the sum of any two equals the third, returning true if so.

Here's the C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

bool any_intf(float a, float b, float c) {
    if (std::round(a) != a || std::round(b) != b || std::round(c) != c) {
        return false;
    }
    return (a + b == c) || (a + c == b) || (b + c == a);
}
```

This code defines the function `any_intf` which takes three floats and returns a boolean based on the specified conditions.
