Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing.

First, I notice that the IR defines a function called @_Z9is_sortedSt6vectorIiSaIiEE. From the mangled name, I think this translates to a function is_sorted that takes a std::vector<int> as an argument. So, the function is probably checking if the vector is sorted.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by allocating space for a boolean (i1) and an integer (i32). The integer is initialized to 1. Then there's a loop that continues until some condition is met.

In the loop, it loads the integer, converts it to i64, and calls the size() function of the vector. It then compares the loop index with the size. If the index is less than the size, it proceeds.

Next, it loads the current element and the previous element using the vector's operator[]. It compares these two elements. If the current element is less than the previous one, it sets the boolean to false and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it continues.

I also see that there are checks for when the vector has 0, 1, or 2 elements, which are probably edge cases. For vectors with two elements, it directly compares them. For larger vectors, it does a more thorough check.

The function returns the boolean value indicating whether the vector is sorted.

Putting this all together, the C++ function should loop through the vector, comparing each element with the next. If any element is greater than the next, it returns false. If all are in order, it returns true.

I should also handle edge cases where the vector is empty or has only one element, in which case it's trivially sorted.

Now, I'll translate this logic into C++ code. I'll start by initializing a boolean as true. Then, I'll loop from the second element to the end, comparing each element with the previous one. If any comparison fails, I'll set the boolean to false and break the loop. Finally, I'll return the boolean.

Wait, in the IR, the loop starts at index 1 and goes up to size-1. So in C++, I should loop from 1 to size() - 1, comparing each i with i-1. That makes sense.

Also, I should handle the case where the vector has less than two elements by returning true immediately, as there's nothing to compare.

Putting it all together, the C++ function should look something like this: check if the vector is empty or has one element, then loop through each pair of consecutive elements to check if they're in non-decreasing order.

I think that's the correct approach. Now I'll write the code accordingly.

The provided LLVM IR code defines a function `is_sorted` that checks if a `std::vector<int>` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Here's the decompiled C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool is_sorted(const vector<int>& vec) {
    bool sorted = true;
    for (size_t i = 1; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        if (vec[i] < vec[i-1]) {
            sorted = false;
            break;
        }
    }
    return sorted;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function takes a `const` reference to a `vector<int>` to avoid copying.
- It initializes a boolean `sorted` to `true`.
- It iterates from the second element (index 1) to the end of the vector.
- For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous one.
- If any such condition is met, it sets `sorted` to `false` and exits the loop early.
- Finally, it returns the `sorted` status.

This code efficiently checks the sorted order of the vector with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
