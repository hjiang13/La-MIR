Okay, so I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the code is doing. 

Looking at the provided IR, I see a function named _Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE. From the naming convention, it seems like this is a C++ function. The prefix _Z indicates it's a mangled name. Let me try to demangle it. 

Using a demangler, _Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE translates to sum_squares(std::vector<float, std::allocator<float>>). So this function takes a vector of floats and returns an integer.

Now, looking into the function. It starts by allocating two integers, initializing them to 0. One seems to be a loop counter (stored in %3) and the other for accumulating the sum (stored in %2). 

The loop starts at label 4. It loads the loop counter, converts it to a 64-bit integer, then calls the vector's size() function. It compares the counter with the size, and if the counter is less, it proceeds into the loop body.

Inside the loop, it loads the current element using vector's operator[] (via the _ixEm function), which is called twice. It then applies the ceil function to each of these elements and multiplies them together. This product is added to the accumulator, which is then stored back. After each iteration, the loop counter is incremented.

Wait, that seems a bit odd. Why are we accessing the same index twice? Let me check again. Oh, I see, it's accessing the same index both times. So it's taking the element at the current index, applying ceil to it, then again taking the same element, applying ceil again, and multiplying them. So it's effectively squaring the ceiled value and adding it to the sum.

After processing all elements, the function returns the accumulated sum.

Putting this together, the C++ function would loop through each element of the vector, take each element, apply ceil, square it, and sum all these squared values.

So the decompiled code would be something like:

int sum_squares(std::vector<float> vec) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        float val = vec[i];
        sum += static_cast<int>(ceilf(val) * ceilf(val));
    }
    return sum;
}

I think that's the correct translation. I should make sure to handle the loop correctly and ensure that the vector is accessed properly. Also, since the original code uses float vectors, the function parameter should reflect that.

To convert the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the IR Function**: The IR defines a function that takes a vector of floats, iterates through each element, applies the ceiling function, squares the result, and accumulates the sum.

2. **Demangle the Function Name**: The mangled name `_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` translates to `sum_squares(std::vector<float, std::allocator<float>>)`.

3. **Translate the Logic**: The function initializes a sum variable, loops over each vector element, applies `ceil` to the element, squares it, and adds it to the sum.

4. **Handle Loop and Indices**: The loop runs from 0 to `size()-1`, accessing each element twice to compute the squared ceiling value.

Here is the resulting C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

int sum_squares(std::vector<float> vec) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        float val = vec[i];
        sum += static_cast<int>(std::ceil(val) * std::ceil(val));
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This code defines a function `sum_squares` that computes the sum of squared ceiling values of each element in the input vector.
