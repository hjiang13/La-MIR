Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR is doing.

Looking at the IR, the main function is `_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE`, which seems to be `minSubArraySum` taking a `vector<long long>` as an argument. The function returns an `i64`, which is a long long.

The function starts by allocating some variables on the stack: `min_sum` and `current_sum` as `i64`, and `i` as an `i32`. It initializes `min_sum` and `current_sum` by calling `vector->at(0)`, which gets the first element of the vector.

Then there's a loop that starts at label `9`. It loads the loop index `i`, compares it with the vector's size, and continues if `i` is less than the size. Inside the loop, it checks if `current_sum` is less than 0. If so, it adds the next element to `current_sum`; otherwise, it starts a new subarray from the current element. After each iteration, it updates `min_sum` if `current_sum` is smaller and increments `i`.

The loop continues until all elements are processed, then returns `min_sum`.

I'll translate this logic into C++. The function will iterate through the vector, maintaining `current_sum` and `min_sum`. Each element either adds to `current_sum` or starts a new subarray. The minimum of these sums is tracked and returned.

I should also include necessary headers and handle edge cases, like an empty vector, but the original code seems to assume the vector isn't empty since it initializes with `at(0)`.

Putting it all together, the C++ function should look something like this:

The given LLVM IR code appears to implement a function that finds the minimum subarray sum in a vector of long long integers. Here's the equivalent C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

long long minSubArraySum(const vector<long long>& arr) {
    long long min_sum = arr[0];
    long long current_sum = arr[0];
    
    for (size_t i = 1; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        if (current_sum < 0) {
            current_sum += arr[i];
        } else {
            current_sum = arr[i];
        }
        
        if (current_sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = current_sum;
        }
    }
    
    return min_sum;
}
```

This code:
1. Initializes `min_sum` and `current_sum` with the first element of the array.
2. Iterates through the array starting from the second element.
3. If `current_sum` is negative, it adds the current element to `current_sum`.
4. If `current_sum` is non-negative, it starts a new subarray with the current element.
5. Updates `min_sum` whenever `current_sum` is smaller than the current `min_sum`.
6. Returns the minimum subarray sum found.

You can use this function by passing a `vector<long long>` to it, and it will return the minimum subarray sum.
