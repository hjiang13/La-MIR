Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by carefully examining the provided IR.

First, I notice that the function is named @_Z4fib4i, which when demangled, becomes "fib4i". So the function is likely called fib4i in C++. It returns an i32, which is a 32-bit integer, and takes an i32 parameter.

Looking at the function's structure, I see several alloca instructions. The first one allocates space for an i32, which I'll call "n". Then there's an allocation for a [100 x i32] array, which I'll name "fibArray". Another i32 is allocated, probably a loop counter or index variable, let's call it "i".

The initial stores set up the array. The first element (index 0) is set to 0, the second (index 1) to 0, the third (index 2) to 2, and the fourth (index 3) to 0. The variable "i" is initialized to 4.

There's a loop starting at label 9. The loop condition checks if "i" is less than or equal to "n". If true, it proceeds into the loop body. Inside, it's calculating each Fibonacci number by summing the previous three numbers. For example, fibArray[i] = fibArray[i-1] + fibArray[i-2] + fibArray[i-3]. After each iteration, "i" is incremented by 1.

Once the loop exits, the function loads the value from fibArray at index "n" and returns it.

Putting this all together, the C++ function initializes an array, fills the first few elements, then iterates to compute each subsequent element up to n, summing the previous three each time.

I need to make sure the function handles cases where n is less than the initialized elements, but since the loop runs from 4 up to n, it should be safe as long as n is at least 0.

So, the C++ code should declare the array, set initial values, loop from 4 to n, compute each fibArray[i], and return fibArray[n].

The provided LLVM IR code can be decompiled into the following C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fib4i(int n) {
    int fibArray[100];
    int i = 4;

    fibArray[0] = 0;
    fibArray[1] = 0;
    fibArray[2] = 2;
    fibArray[3] = 0;

    while (i <= n) {
        fibArray[i] = fibArray[i-1] + fibArray[i-2] + fibArray[i-3];
        i++;
    }

    return fibArray[n];
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int result = fib4i(10); // You can replace 10 with any number up to 99
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `fib4i` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer.

2. **Array Initialization**: A fixed-size array `fibArray` of size 100 is declared to store Fibonacci numbers up to the 100th position.

3. **Base Cases**: The first four elements of the array are initialized with values 0, 0, 2, and 0 respectively.

4. **Loop to Compute Fibonacci Numbers**: Starting from index 4 up to `n`, each Fibonacci number is calculated as the sum of the three preceding numbers in the sequence.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the Fibonacci number at position `n`.

6. **Example Usage**: The `main` function demonstrates how to use `fib4i` by computing and printing the Fibonacci number for an example input.

This code should compile and run correctly, producing the expected Fibonacci sequence values based on the input parameter.
