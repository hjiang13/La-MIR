<think>
Okay, I'm looking at this LLVM IR code, and I need to decompile it back into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what each part of the IR is doing.

First, I see that there's a function called @_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE, which I think is the C++ function count_nums that takes a std::vector<int> as an argument. The IR uses the calling convention where the function name is mangled, so I'll need to demangle that to get the correct C++ function name.

Next, I look at the variables allocated in the function. There are four i32 variables allocated: %2, %3, %4, and %5. These are likely to be the counters and loop variables used in the function. The function initializes %2 and %3 to 0, which probably correspond to a count of positive numbers and a loop index, respectively.

The main loop starts at label 6. It loads the current value of %3 (the loop index) into %7, converts it to i64, and then calls the size() function of the vector to get its length. It compares whether the loop index is less than the size, and if so, it proceeds into the loop body.

Inside the loop, the function retrieves the current element from the vector using the operator[] (which is the @_ZNSt6vectorIiSaIEEixEm function). It checks if the element is greater than 0. If it is, it increments the count in %2 and branches to the loop continuation.

If the element is not greater than 0, it enters a section where it calculates the absolute value of the element, stores it in %5, and then processes each digit of this absolute value. It uses a loop to extract each digit by repeatedly taking modulo 10 and dividing by 10. For each digit, if it's 10 or more, it adds the digit's value to a sum stored in %4. After processing all digits, if the sum is greater than 0, it increments the count in %2.

Once all elements are processed, the function returns the value stored in %2, which is the total count of numbers that meet the criteria.

Putting this all together, the function counts how many numbers in the vector have at least one positive digit, considering both positive numbers and the digits of their absolute values if they're non-positive.

I need to translate this logic into C++. The main steps are initializing counters, looping through each element, checking if it's positive, and if not, processing each digit. The function returns the count of such numbers.

I'll structure the C++ function to have a loop over the vector, use a nested loop to process each digit when necessary, and increment the count accordingly. I should also handle the absolute value correctly to avoid issues with negative numbers.

I think I've covered all the parts of the IR. Now, I'll write the C++ code that mirrors this logic.

Here is the C++ source code that corresponds to the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib> // for abs()

using namespace std;

int count_nums(vector<int> vec) {
    int count = 0;
    int num;
    int digit_sum = 0;
    int temp;

    for (int i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i) {
        num = vec[i];
        if (num > 0) {
            count++;
            continue;
        }

        temp = abs(num);
        do {
            digit_sum += temp % 10;
            temp /= 10;
        } while (temp >= 10);

        if (digit_sum > 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `count_nums` takes a `vector<int>` as input and returns an `int`.
- It initializes `count` to keep track of numbers with positive digits.
- It iterates over each element in the vector.
  - If the number is positive, it increments `count`.
  - If the number is non-positive, it calculates the absolute value and processes each digit.
  - For each digit, it adds the digit to `digit_sum`. If after processing all digits `digit_sum` is greater than 0, it increments `count`.
- Finally, the function returns the total count.

This code should compile and run correctly, producing the same results as the original LLVM IR.
