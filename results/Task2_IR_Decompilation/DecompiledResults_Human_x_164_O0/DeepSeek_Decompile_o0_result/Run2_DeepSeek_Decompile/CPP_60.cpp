Okay, I need to decompile this LLVM IR code into C or C++. Let me look at the IR provided. 

The function is named @_Z8sum_to_ni, which likely translates to sum_to_n in C++. The function takes an i32 parameter, which is an integer. 

Looking at the IR:
- It allocates memory for an i32 and stores the input.
- Then it loads the stored value twice into %3 and %4.
- %5 is %4 + 1, which is n+1.
- %6 is %3 multiplied by %5, so n*(n+1).
- %7 is %6 divided by 2 using signed division, which gives n(n+1)/2.
- Finally, returns %7.

So, the function calculates the sum of the first n integers using the formula n(n+1)/2.

I should write this as a C++ function. The function name needs to be corrected from sum_to_ni to sum_to_n. The parameter is an integer, and the function returns an integer.

I'll write the function without unnecessary memory operations since the IR seems to store and load the value, but in C++, it's simpler to just use the parameter directly.

Testing the function with a value like 10 should return 55, which makes sense for the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.

To decompile the provided LLVM IR code into C++ source code, we can analyze the IR and translate it back into a function. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Function Name and Parameters**:
   - The function is named `@_Z8sum_to_ni`, which is the mangled name for `sum_to_n`.
   - It takes a single parameter of type `i32` (a 32-bit integer).

2. **Analyze the IR Instructions**:
   - The function starts by allocating memory for an `i32` and storing the parameter value.
   - It then loads the stored value into two different registers (`%3` and `%4`).
   - It adds `1` to the value in `%4` and multiplies it with the value in `%3`.
   - The result is then divided by `2` using signed division.
   - Finally, the result is returned.

3. **Translate the IR to C++**:
   - The operations suggest the function calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int sum_to_n(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int result = sum_to_n(10);  // Should return 55
    std::cout << "Sum to n: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code defines a function `sum_to_n` that computes the sum of the first `n` integers using the arithmetic series formula. The `main` function demonstrates how to use this function with an example. You can save this code in a `.cpp` file and compile it with a C++ compiler to run it.
