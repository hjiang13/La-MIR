Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let me start by understanding what the IR code is doing.

Looking at the code, I see two functions. The first one is `_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi`, which I think is a C++ function. The mangling suggests it's `add_elements` taking a `std::vector<int>` and an `int` as parameters.

The function starts by allocating space for three integers: `a`, `b`, and `i`. It initializes `a` to the input `n`, `b` to 0, and `i` to 0. Then it enters a loop that runs while `i` is less than `n`.

Inside the loop, it accesses the vector using `operator[]` with index `i` three times. The first check is if the element is greater than or equal to -99. If not, it continues. The second check is if the element is less than or equal to 99. If both conditions are met, it adds the element's value to `b`.

After processing each element, `i` is incremented. Once the loop finishes, it returns the sum `b`.

The second function is the `operator[]` implementation for `std::vector<int>`. It calculates the address of the element based on the index and returns a pointer to it.

Now, I'll translate this logic into C++. The function `add_elements` will loop through the vector, check each element, and sum those within the specified range. The `operator[]` is already provided by `std::vector`, so I don't need to redefine it.

I should also include necessary headers like `<vector>` and `<iostream>` for input/output if needed, though the function itself doesn't use `iostream`.

Putting it all together, the C++ code should look something like the one provided in the answer, with the `add_elements` function implementing the described logic.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code that corresponds to the provided LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int add_elements(vector<int> &vec, int n) {
    int a = n;
    int b = 0;
    int i = 0;
    
    while (i < a) {
        if (vec[i] >= -99) {
            if (vec[i] <= 99) {
                b += vec[i];
            }
        }
        i++;
    }
    
    return b;
}
```

This C++ code can be compiled and run directly. It defines a function `add_elements` that takes a reference to a `std::vector<int>` and an integer `n`. The function iterates through the first `n` elements of the vector, summing those elements whose values are between -99 and 99 inclusive. The sum is then returned.

To use this function, you would include it in a C++ program, for example:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int add_elements(vector<int> &vec, int n);

int main() {
    vector<int> myVec = { /* Initialize with your elements */ };
    int n = myVec.size();
    int result = add_elements(myVec, n);
    cout << "Sum of elements in range: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
