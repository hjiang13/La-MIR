Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by looking at the IR code provided.

First, I notice that the main function is `_Z9solutionsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which I think translates to `solutions(std::vector<int>)` because of the way C++ mangles function names. The function takes a vector of integers and returns an integer.

Inside this function, there are two variables allocated on the stack: `%2` and `%3`, both `i32` (integers). `%2` is initialized to 0, and `%3` is also 0. Then there's a loop starting at label 4.

The loop checks if `2 * %3` is less than the size of the vector. The size is obtained by calling `size()`, which is the member function of the vector. If the condition is true, it proceeds; otherwise, it exits the loop.

Inside the loop, it calculates `2 * %3` again and uses it to index into the vector using `operator[]`, which in IR is represented by the function `@_ZNSt6vectorIiSaIiEEixEm`. The value retrieved is then checked for being odd using `srem` (remainder) with 2. If it's 1, meaning it's odd, it adds that value to `%2`. Then it increments `%3` and continues the loop.

So, putting this together, the function initializes a sum to 0, iterates through the vector, and for each even index (since it's 2*i), it checks if the element is odd. If it is, it adds that element to the sum.

Wait, no, actually, the loop variable is `i`, and it's using `2*i` as the index. So for each i starting from 0, it's accessing elements 0, 2, 4, etc. Then it checks if those elements are odd. If they are, it adds them to the sum.

Wait, no, the loop variable `%3` is i, and it's using `2*i` as the index. So for i=0, index 0; i=1, index 2; i=2, index 4, etc. So it's accessing every other element starting from 0. Then, for each of those elements, it checks if the value is odd (remainder when divided by 2 is 1). If so, it adds the value to the sum.

So the function is summing up all the elements at even indices (0-based, every second element) that are odd numbers.

Wait, but in the code, the index is `2*i`, so for i=0, index 0; i=1, index 2; i=2, index 4, etc. So yes, it's every other element, but starting from 0.

So, the C++ code would have a loop that goes through the vector, accessing elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., up to the size of the vector. For each element, it checks if the value is odd, and if so, adds it to the sum.

Wait, but in the IR, the loop increments i by 1 each time, and the index is 2*i. So i runs from 0 up to (size/2)-1, but the condition is `2*i < size`, so it's correct.

So, the function can be translated as:

int solutions(std::vector<int> vec) {
    int sum = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (2 * i < vec.size()) {
        int index = 2 * i;
        int val = vec[index];
        if (val % 2 == 1) {
            sum += val;
        }
        i++;
    }
    return sum;
}

Wait, but in the IR, the loop condition is `ult i64 %7, %8`, which is checking if `2*i` (as a 64-bit integer) is less than the size (also 64-bit). So yes, the condition is correct.

But wait, in the code, the loop starts with `%3` as 0, and each iteration increments it by 1. So the index is 0, 2, 4, etc.

So, the code is correct as I wrote above.

Now, I need to make sure that the function is correctly translated, including the vector operations.

In the IR, the vector is passed as a pointer, and the size is obtained via a call to `size()`, which is correctly handled.

So, the final C++ code should be something like that.

The provided LLVM IR code translates to a C++ function named `solutions` that takes a `std::vector<int>` and returns an integer. The function iterates through the vector, accessing elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), checks if each element is odd, and sums those odd values. Here's the decompiled code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

int solutions(std::vector<int> vec) {
    int sum = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (2 * i < vec.size()) {
        int index = 2 * i;
        int val = vec[index];
        if (val % 2 == 1) {
            sum += val;
        }
        i++;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

To use this function, include it in a C++ program with the necessary headers and a main function if needed.
