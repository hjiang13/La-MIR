Okay, I need to decompile the given LLVM IR code back into C++ source code. Let me start by carefully examining the IR code provided.

First, I notice that the main function is `_Z13triangle_areafff`, which suggests it's a function called `triangle_area` that takes three floats and returns a float. The function has several local variables allocated with `alloca`, which in C++ would correspond to local variables on the stack.

Looking at the function, it starts by storing the input parameters into these allocated variables. Then, it loads them and performs some floating-point operations. There are a series of conditional branches based on the results of `fcmp ole` (ordered less than or equal) instructions. These checks seem to be verifying the triangle inequality theorem, ensuring that the three sides can form a valid triangle.

If any of the conditions fail, the function stores `-1.0f` into the result variable and branches to the exit label. If all conditions pass, it proceeds to calculate the area. The area calculation involves computing the semi-perimeter and then using Heron's formula, which includes a square root. However, in the provided code, instead of a square root, there's a call to `std::pow` with an exponent of `0.5`, which effectively computes the square root.

I also see a helper function `@_ZSt3powIfdEN9__gnu_cxx11__promote_2IT_T0_NS0_9__promoteIS2_Xsr3std12__is_integerIS2_EE7__valueEE6__typeENS4_IS3_Xsr3std12__is_integerIS3_EE7__valueEE6__typeEE6__typeES2_S3_` which is part of the standard library's `std::pow` function. This function takes a float and a double exponent, extends the float to double, and calls the `pow` function from the C standard library.

Putting this together, the main function first checks if the three sides can form a valid triangle. If not, it returns `-1.0f`. If they can, it calculates the area using Heron's formula, which involves computing the semi-perimeter, then applying the formula sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)), but here done using `pow` for the square root.

I'll structure the C++ code to reflect these steps: declare the function, check the triangle inequalities, compute the area if valid, and return the result. I'll also make sure to include the necessary headers, like `<cmath>` for `pow`.

I should also note that the original code might have used `sqrt` instead of `pow(0.5)`, but in this case, `pow` is used. I'll replicate that in the C++ code for accuracy.

Finally, I'll ensure the function is correctly named and that all variables are properly handled, maintaining the same logic as the IR code.

Here is the decompiled C++ source code:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

float triangle_area(float a, float b, float c) {
    if ((a + b <= c) || (a + c <= b) || (b + c <= a)) {
        return -1.0f;
    }

    float s = (a + b + c) / 2.0f;
    float area = std::pow(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c), 0.5f);
    return area;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function `triangle_area` computes the area of a triangle given three sides using Heron's formula.
- It first checks if the sides can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem.
- If the sides are invalid, it returns `-1.0`.
- If valid, it calculates the semi-perimeter `s` and then the area using `std::pow` to compute the square root of the product under the square root in Heron's formula.
