Okay, I'm trying to decompile this LLVM IR code into C++ source code. Let's start by looking at the provided IR code. The main function seems to be `_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which I can decode using C++ name mangling.

Decoding `_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` gives me `sum_squares(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int>>)`. So this is a function called sum_squares that takes a vector of integers as an argument.

Looking at the IR, the function starts by allocating two integers, `i32 %2` and `i32 %3`, both initialized to 0. These are likely loop variables, with `%2` holding the sum and `%3` being the loop index. The loop starts at label 4.

In the loop, it loads the current index from `%3`, converts it to i64, and calls `size()` on the vector. It checks if the index is less than the size. If not, it exits the loop. Otherwise, it proceeds.

Then, there are two main branches based on the value of the index modulo 3 and 4. If the index modulo 3 is 0, it enters block 13. If not, it checks if index modulo 4 is 0 in block 25. If that's true, it goes to block 29; otherwise, it goes to block 46.

In block 13, it seems to be accessing two elements of the vector, multiplying them, and adding the result to the sum. It uses `operator[]` with the current index and the same index again. So, it's adding the square of each element when the index is a multiple of 3.

In block 29, when the index is a multiple of 4, it's accessing three consecutive elements, multiplying the first two, then multiplying the result with the third, and adding this to the sum. This suggests a triple product for elements where the index is a multiple of 4.

In block 46, for other indices, it's simply accessing the current element, squaring it (since it's added as is), and adding it to the sum.

After processing each element, the loop increments the index and continues until all elements are processed. Finally, it returns the sum.

Putting this together, the C++ function initializes a sum to 0 and iterates over each element of the vector. For each element at index i, if i mod 3 is 0, it adds the square of the element. If i mod 4 is 0, it multiplies three consecutive elements and adds the result. Otherwise, it just adds the square of the element.

I should make sure to handle the cases correctly and ensure that accessing `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` doesn't go out of bounds, but since the loop runs until `size()`, it should be safe as long as the vector has enough elements when those cases are triggered.

So, the C++ code will have a loop that checks each index and applies the respective operation based on the modulo conditions.

The provided LLVM IR code can be decompiled into the following C++ source code. This function calculates the sum of squares of elements in a vector, with special handling for elements at indices that are multiples of 3 or 4.

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int sum_squares(vector<int> *vec) {
    int sum = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (true) {
        if (i >= vec->size()) break;
        
        if (i % 3 == 0) {
            int a = vec->operator[](i);
            sum += a * a;
        } else if (i % 4 == 0) {
            int a = vec->operator[](i);
            int b = vec->operator[](i);
            int c = vec->operator[](i);
            sum += a * b * c;
        } else {
            int a = vec->operator[](i);
            sum += a;
        }
        
        i++;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This C++ code defines a function `sum_squares` that takes a pointer to a vector of integers. It initializes `sum` to 0 and iterates through each element of the vector. Depending on the current index `i`, it either adds the square of the element (if `i` is a multiple of 3), adds the product of three consecutive elements (if `i` is a multiple of 4), or simply adds the element itself. The loop continues until all elements are processed, and the final sum is returned.
