Here is the C source code generated from the provided LLVM IR code:

```c
int greatest_common_divisor(int a, int b) {
    int D.3315;
    int D.3316;
    int D.3317;
    int D.3318;

    D.3315 = a;
    D.3316 = b;
    while (1) {
        if (D.3315 < D.3316) {
            D.3318 = D.3315;
            D.3315 = D.3316;
            D.3316 = D.3318;
        }
        D.3315 = D.3315 % D.3316;
        if (D.3315 == 0) {
            return D.3316;
        }
    }
}
```

Note that I've kept the original variable names generated by the LLVM IR, even though they are not very readable. If you want me to rename them to something more meaningful, please let me know.
