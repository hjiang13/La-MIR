Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the corresponding C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int abs(int x) {
    return (x > 0) ? x : -x;
}

int multiply(int a, int b) {
    int temp_a = abs(a) % 10;
    int temp_b = abs(b) % 10;
    return temp_a * temp_b;
}
```

Please note that the generated C code only includes the functions present in the LLVM IR code, which are `abs` and `multiply`. The `abs` function is a standard library function in C, but I have provided a simple implementation for it based on the LLVM IR code. The `multiply` function is the main function of interest, which takes two integers as input, calculates their absolute values modulo 10, and returns their product.
