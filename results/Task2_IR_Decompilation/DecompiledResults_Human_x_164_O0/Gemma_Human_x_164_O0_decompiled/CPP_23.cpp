Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the corresponding C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <string.h>

int strlen(std::string* s) {
    return s->length();
}
```

Note that the IR code appears to be a part of a larger C++ program, and the generated C code may not be compilable as-is due to the presence of C++-specific constructs (e.g., `std::string`). If you'd like, I can attempt to generate a more complete C++ source code that matches the IR code. Let me know!
