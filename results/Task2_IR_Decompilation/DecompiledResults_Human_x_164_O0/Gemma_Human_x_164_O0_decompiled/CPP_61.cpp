Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <string.h>

bool correct_bracketing(std::string s) {
    int counter = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (s[i] == '(') {
            counter++;
        } else if (s[i] == ')') {
            counter--;
        }
        if (counter < 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return counter == 0;
}
```

Please note that the generated C code is not exactly matching the LLVM IR code as the LLVM IR code seems to be compiled from C++ code (due to the presence of `std::__cxx11::basic_string` class). I have translated it to equivalent C code using the `std::string` class. Also, I have assumed that the function `correct_bracketing` returns a boolean value indicating whether the input string has correct bracketing or not. 

In the generated C code, the function iterates over the input string, increments a counter when it encounters an opening parenthesis and decrements it when it encounters a closing parenthesis. If the counter becomes negative at any point, the function immediately returns `false`. If the loop completes and the counter is zero, the function returns `true`, indicating correct bracketing. Otherwise, it returns `false`. 

Please note that the generated code may not be perfect and may need further modifications based on your specific requirements. 

Also, note that the generated code does not handle the case where the input string is null or empty. You may need to add additional checks for these cases based on your requirements.
