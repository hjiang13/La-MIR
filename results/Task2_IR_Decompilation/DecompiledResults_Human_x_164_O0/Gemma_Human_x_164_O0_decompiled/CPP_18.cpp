Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Please note that the generated C code may not be perfect and might require some manual adjustments.

Here is the generated C source code:
```c
#include <string.h>

int how_many_times(const char* str1, const char* str2) {
    int count = 0;
    int len1 = strlen(str1);
    int len2 = strlen(str2);

    if (len1 == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i <= len1 - len2; i++) {
        char* substr = (char*)malloc(len2 + 1);
        strncpy(substr, str1 + i, len2);
        substr[len2] = '\0';

        if (strcmp(substr, str2) == 0) {
            count++;
        }

        free(substr);
    }

    return count;
}

int compare(const char* str1, const char* str2, size_t len) {
    if (len == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    return memcmp(str1, str2, len);
}
```
Please note that I've assumed the `how_many_times` function is the main function of interest, and I've generated the C code accordingly. I've also generated the `compare` function as it was present in the IR code, but it's not clear if it's actually used in the `how_many_times` function. If you need any further adjustments or have any specific requirements, please let me know!
