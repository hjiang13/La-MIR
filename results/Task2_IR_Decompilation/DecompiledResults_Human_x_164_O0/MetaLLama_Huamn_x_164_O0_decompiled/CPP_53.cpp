Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the corresponding C source code. Here it is:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
  int c = a + b;
  return c;
}
```

Note that I've removed the unnecessary variables and simply performed the addition operation directly. The generated C code is equivalent to the provided LLVM IR code. Let me know if you have any further requests!
