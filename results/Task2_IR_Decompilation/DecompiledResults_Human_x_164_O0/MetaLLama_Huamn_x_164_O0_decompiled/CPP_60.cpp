Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
int sum_to_n(int n) {
  int temp = n;
  return (temp * (temp + 1)) / 2;
}
```

Note that I've removed the unnecessary variables and optimized the code to match the original functionality. Let me know if you'd like me to explain any part of the transformation!
