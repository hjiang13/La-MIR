Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate a C source code format. 

Here is the C source code:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <string.h>

bool correct_bracketing(const char* str) {
    int open_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(str); ià¤¾) {
        if (str[i] == '(') {
            open_count++;
        } else if (str[i] == ')') {
            open_count--;
            if (open_count < 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return open_count == 0;
}
```

Please note that the generated C source code might not perfectly match the original C code that was used to generate the LLVM IR, as some information might be lost during the compilation process. However, the generated code should be functionally equivalent to the original code. 

Also, please note that I have assumed that the input string is a null-terminated string. If the input string is not null-terminated, you might need to modify the generated code to handle the length of the string differently. 

If you need any further assistance, please let me know!
