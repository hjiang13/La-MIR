Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the corresponding C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <string.h>

int strlen(std::string *s) {
    return (int)s->length();
}
```

Note that the IR code appears to be a simple wrapper around the `std::string::length()` function, which is part of the C++ Standard Library. The generated C code is a simplified version of this function, taking a `std::string*` as input and returning its length as an `int`.

However, please note that `std::string` is a C++ class and does not exist in C. If you want a pure C version, you would need to modify the code to use C-style strings (i.e., `char*` and `strlen` from `string.h`).

Here's a possible C version:

```c
#include <string.h>

int strlen(const char *s) {
    return (int)strlen(s);
}
```

Or, to avoid the unnecessary cast:

```c
#include <string.h>

int strlen(const char *s) {
    return strlen(s);
}
```

Keep in mind that the `strlen` function from `string.h` already returns an `int`, so the cast is not necessary.
