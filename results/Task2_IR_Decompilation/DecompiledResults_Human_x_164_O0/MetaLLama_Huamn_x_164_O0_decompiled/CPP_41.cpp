Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
int car_race_collision(int x) {
  int temp = x;
  return temp * temp;
}
```

Note that I've replaced the mangled function name `_Z18car_race_collisioni` with a more readable name `car_race_collision`, as is conventional in C. The function signature and body have been translated from the IR code, preserving the same functionality.
