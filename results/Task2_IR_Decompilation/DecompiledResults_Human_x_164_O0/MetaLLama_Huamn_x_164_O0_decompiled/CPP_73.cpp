Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the corresponding C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int* data;
    int* end;
    int* capacity;
} vector;

int smallest_change(vector* v) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < v->end - v->data - 1; i++) {
        if (v->data[i] != v->data[v->end - v->data - 1 - i]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int vector_size(vector* v) {
    return (v->end - v->data);
}

int* vector_at(vector* v, int index) {
    return v->data + index;
}
```

Please note that this C code assumes that the input vector is a struct with three members: `data`, `end`, and `capacity`, where `data` is a pointer to the first element of the array, `end` is a pointer to the end of the array, and `capacity` is not used in this specific code. Also, the `vector_size` and `vector_at` functions are not actually used in the `smallest_change` function, but they are included as they are present in the original IR code.
