Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the corresponding C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <vector>

int add(std::vector<int>& v) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i += 2) {
        if (v[i + 1] % 2 == 0) {
            sum += v[i + 1];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

Note that I've only generated the C++ code for the `add` function, as it's the only function defined in the provided LLVM IR code. The other functions (`_ZNKSt6vectorIiSaIiEE4sizeEv` and `_ZNSt6vectorIiSaIiEEixEm`) are part of the C++ Standard Library and do not need to be redefined. 

Also, please note that the generated C++ code is based on my interpretation of the LLVM IR code and may not be exactly what the original C++ code looked like. However, it should have the same functionality. 

If you need any further assistance or clarification, feel free to ask! 

Here is the C source code:

```c
int add(int* arr, int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i += 2) {
        if (arr[i + 1] % 2 == 0) {
            sum += arr[i + 1];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This C code does essentially the same thing as the C++ code. It takes an array and its size as input, and returns the sum of the even-indexed elements that are also even numbers. Note that the array indexing is 0-based, so the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on. 

Please note that in the C version, I had to explicitly pass the size of the array as a parameter, whereas in the C++ version, the size is obtained using the `size()` method of the `std::vector` class.
#undef NDEBUG
#include<assert.h>
int main(){
    assert (add({4, 88}) == 88);
    assert (add({4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122}) == 122);
    assert (add({4, 0, 6, 7}) == 0);
    assert (add({4, 4, 6, 8}) == 12);
}
