   80 | Please note that the generated C source code is not guaranteed to be perfect or fully optimized, as the LLVM IR code may contain platform-specific or compiler-specific features that cannot be directly translated to C. Additionally, some of the functions in the generated C code may not be necessary or may be redundant, as they were automatically generated from the LLVM IR code.

./CPP_0.cpp:48:1: error: ‘Note’ does not name a type
   48 | Note that I've made some assumptions about the C source code, such as using `float` as the type for the vector elements, and using `fabsf` from the math library for the `abs_f` function. Also, I've removed the `llvm.fabs.f32` intrinsic and replaced it with the `fabsf` function. If you need to make any changes, please let me know.

./CPP_40.cpp:53:1: error: ‘Note’ does not name a type
   53 | Note that I've kept the generated C code as close as possible to the original IR code, without any optimizations or simplifications. The `Vector` struct and its related types are defined based on the IR code's type definitions. The `triples_sum_to_zero` function is the equivalent of the IR code's `@_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` function.

   30 | Please note that I had to make some assumptions about the input and output of the `sum_squares` function, as well as the `main` function, since they were not explicitly defined in the IR code. The generated C code may not be exactly what you had in mind, but it should be equivalent to the IR code provided.

   40 | Please note that this is a simplified version of the original IR code and may not cover all the cases. The original IR code seems to be generated by a C++ compiler, and it's using some C++-specific features and libraries, which I've tried to simplify and adapt to C. Also, the generated code may not be fully functional or correct, and it's recommended to review and test it thoroughly.

   61 | Note that the generated C code may not be perfect and might require some manual adjustments to work correctly. The LLVM IR code appears to be generated from a C++ program, and some C++ features like classes and templates are not directly translatable to C. I have attempted to generate equivalent C code, but some modifications may be necessary to achieve the desired behavior.
